That&#39;s just too much. We&#39;re not getting the value out of those dollars that we need to get out.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOver 80 percent?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat percentage sounded familiar. In a February Truth-O-Meter article, we reported that budgeted non-dedicated state spending increased 80 percent from the 2000-01 budget, adopted the year before Perry became governor, to the current budget. We <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/feb/24/rick-perry/gov-perry-says-he-made-tough-decisions-including-3/\">found shaky Perry&#39;s statement</a> that on his watch, &quot;we cut state spending.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter asking White&#39;s campaign for backup on his &quot;over 80 percent&quot; statement, we revisited the budget numbers -- and realized an error of our own.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were correct in February that budgeted non-dedicated spending has increased about $25 billion during Perry&#39;s decade-plus as governor. Indeed, such spending increased from $55.7 billion in 2000-01 to nearly $80.6 billion in 2010-11, according to the &quot;Fiscal Size-up&quot; for 2010-11 published by the Legislative Budget Board. However, we miscalculated the percentage increase, which was 45 percent -- not the 80 percent we reported.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd how did White reach his proclaimed increase of <em>over</em> 80 percent? The entire budget, counting all funding sources including federal and local aid, increased from nearly $101.8 billion in 2000-01 to almost $182.2 billion in 2010-11-- a boost of 79 percent. (Please free free to check our math; we thank you.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe ran the 79 percent bump by Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association. He suggested any comparison of the 2000-01 budget and the 2010-11 budget take into account two factors in the latest budget that weren&#39;t at play in 2000-01.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, Perry and state lawmakers agreed several years ago to cover reductions in school property taxes with state revenue; that&#39;s costing $14 billion in the 2010-11 budget. Craymer said that commitment doesn&#39;t translate to an increase in government spending; it&#39;s a shift in which level of government is doing the spending. Second, the latest budget includes about $12 billion in one-time federal stimulus aid. Take the combined $26 billion out of the comparison and the state budget increase since 2000-01 falls to 53 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe budget board offers another way of weighing changes in spending by adjusting raw budget numbers for changes in population and inflation. At our request, the board created a chart enabling us to compare the adjusted numbers for the 2000-01 budget against the 2010-11 version. Counting all funding sources, during Perry&#39;s gubernatorial years the state budget adjusted for changes in population and inflation has increased 18 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, where does this leave White&#39;s statement?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhite spokeswoman Katy Bacon said in a Tuesday e-mail that White should have said &quot;about 80 percent&quot; in the Midland interview instead of &quot;over 80 percent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBacon&#39;s e-mail also notes expectations the 2011 Legislature will confront an $18 billion revenue shortfall, which Bacon calls a deficit. Given that, her e-mail says, &quot;Bill will have to make cuts. He is very good at this and has often discussed his approach to making cuts and finding efficiencies. He has said he needs to &#39;get under the hood&#39; and also work with legislators on specific cuts.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUpshot: Budgeted spending increased nearly 79 percent on Perry&#39;s watch, not the &quot;over 80 percent&quot; White said. Also, there are ways to analyze the increase that reduce the growth percentage. Still, it&#39;s defensible to lean on raw budget amounts.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate White&#39;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-10T14:11:33.052428", "ruling_date": "2010-08-12T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Bill White says state budget up over 80 percent under Rick Perry", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-white-says-state-budget-80-percent-under-rick", "ruling_link_text": "Nearly so, counting all funding sources", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/08102010_katybaconresponse.rtf\">E-mail</a>, response to PolitiFact Texas, Katy Bacon, communications director, Bill White campaign, Aug. 10, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Dale Craymer, president, Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, Aug. 10, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKWES-TV, Midland, <a href=\"http://www.kwes.com/global/category.asp?c=163304&amp;clipId=&amp;topVideoCatNo=121765&amp;topVideoCatNoB=83259&amp;topVideoCatNoC=182033&amp;topVideoCatNoD=169582&amp;topVideoCatNoE=169586&amp;clipId=5013658&amp;topVideoCatNo=121765&amp;autoStart=true\">&quot;Bill White Makes Campaign Stop,&quot;</a> Aug. 9, 2010 (accessed Aug. 10, 2010)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLegislative Budget Board, charts, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/08102010_katybaconresponse.html\">&quot;State Spending, 2000-01 Compared to 2010-11, Adjusted for Growth in Inflation and Population,&quot;</a> Aug. 10, 2010,&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Fiscal_Size-up/Fiscal%20Size-up%202010-11.pdf\">&quot;Fiscal Size-up, 2010-11,&quot;</a> December 2009 (accessed Aug. 10, 2010)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Texas, Truth-O-Meter article, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/feb/24/rick-perry/gov-perry-says-he-made-tough-decisions-including-3/\">&quot;Gov.
