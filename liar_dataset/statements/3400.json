A companion bill is moving through the Florida House.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring floor debate prior to its passage on March 10, 2011, state Sen. Thad Altman, R-Rockledge, tried to offer an amendment that would give school districts flexibility in judging teachers who teach students who receive free or reduced lunch. The bill already offered leeway for judging English for Speakers of Other&nbsp;Languages (ESOL) and special-needs teachers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAltman said he wanted to acknowledge the &quot;extra challenges&quot; that educators who teach students on free or reduced lunch have.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe idea, however, got a rise out of the lone Democratic supporter of the bill, Sen. Gary Siplin, D-Orlando.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Are you saying just because a child is on free or reduced lunch, they need additional assistance?&quot; asked Siplin, who said that he -- like Gov. Rick Scott -- &quot;grew up in the projects&quot; and turned out all right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAltman recoiled to say that wasn&#39;t his intent, and claimed that free and reduced lunch students are performing as well as their counterparts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Our poverty schools are performing just as well,&quot; Altman said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAltman&#39;s amendment died by a voice vote, but since this debate will continue in the House, we thought it important to address his broader point. The question in this case: Are students receiving free and reduced lunch performing as well as students who don&#39;t?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe answer, on average, is no.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Florida researched <a href=\"https://app1.fldoe.org/FCATDemographics/Default.aspx\" id=\"igc:\" title=\"student performance on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test for 2010\">student performance on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test for 2010</a> through data supplied by the Florida Department of Education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFCAT exams are issued to students starting in the third grade.

Students take the FCAT math exam each year starting in the third grade until they finish their sophomore year of high school. Fifth graders in 2010 scored a 336 on average. Those who received free or reduced lunch scored 323 on average, while those who did not scored 356. The same trend played out for every grade level.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&#39;re attaching the summary reports for each test from 2010 so you can see for yourself.

And he said that in his home of Brevard County there were examples of&nbsp;schools with high rates of students receiving free or reduced lunches who were performing as well as districts were students were better off. The current version of the bill, Altman said,&nbsp;draws no distinction for those high-performing teachers who are bucking the statewide trend.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe said he hoped someone would carry forward&nbsp;a similar proposal when the debate moved to the House.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAltman wanted to insert language in an education bill that would have given school districts more leeway to offer raises to teachers who instruct children receiving free or reduced lunch, saying it was important to acknowledge the &quot;extra challenges&quot; those teachers face. When pressed by Siplin if he was suggesting poor students aren&#39;t as smart as others, he said no -- that students receiving free or reduced lunch are performing as well as everyone else.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be clear, we&#39;re only talking about test scores here, not capabilities or smarts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThough in a roundabout way it may actually help his point, Altman made a general claim about student performance that contradicts the facts.&nbsp;&nbsp;We rate it False.&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-03-10T14:10:24.111303", "ruling_date": "2011-03-10T23:38:31", "ruling_headline": "During teacher bill debate, talk turns to student performance", "ruling_headline_slug": "during-teacher-bill-debate-talk-turns-student-perf", "ruling_link_text": "Poorer students perform worse on FCAT, on average", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<div goog_docs_charindex=\"4209\">\r\n\t<a goog_docs_charindex=\"4210\" href=\"http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/736\" id=\"zrz1\" title=\"SB 736\">SB 736</a>, accessed March 10, 2011</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"4244\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"4247\">\r\n\tSB 736 floor debate, March 10, 2011</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"4284\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"4287\">\r\n\t<a goog_docs_charindex=\"4288\" href=\"https://app1.fldoe.org/FCATDemographics/Default.aspx\" id=\"y98d\" title=\"2010 FCAT results\">2010 FCAT results</a>, accessed March 10, 2011</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"4287\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"4287\">\r\n\t2010 FCAT <a href=\"https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ag6LtLEJqtdcdF9WOU91SDdXdTI5ZW1nbDFLRERvRWc&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CMqCnIkJ\" id=\"cmj4\" title=\"the reading results here\">reading results</a> by free and reduced lunch, accessed March 10, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t2010 FCAT <a href=\"https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ag6LtLEJqtdcdGt3X2FIQ0pFZ0wwYjJZc0VfQU1YT2c&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=COqbvf8G\" id=\"bo_f\" title=\"the math results here\">math results</a> by free and reduced lunch, accessed March 10, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t2010 FCAT <a href=\"https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ag6LtLEJqtdcdExXVmxYaVUxcnBsZ29Hd0p5VjVJQnc&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CI37lDw\" id=\"st.p\" title=\"the writing results here\">writing results</a> by free and reduced lunch, accessed March 10, 2011</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"4287\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"4287\">\r\n\t2010 FCAT <a href=\"https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ag6LtLEJqtdcdDc5bW9peUdaU2JBMkZLSVYza3RUYmc&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CP_zraQF\" id=\"ft5j\" title=\"the science results here\">science results</a> by free and reduced lunch, accessed March 10, 2011</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"4334\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"4337\">\r\n\t<em>St. Petersburg Times</em>, &quot;<a goog_docs_charindex=\"4361\" href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/senate-gives-final-ok-teacher-pay-tenure-bill\" id=\"s:g3\" title=\"Senate gives final OK to teacher pay, tenure bill\">Senate gives final OK to teacher pay, tenure bill</a>,&quot; March 10, 2011</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"4337\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div goog_docs_charindex=\"4337\">\r\n\tInterview with Sen.
