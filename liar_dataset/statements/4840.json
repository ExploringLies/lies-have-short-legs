As it is, new jobs are not being created in New Jersey, according to Wisniewski, who also is chairman of the state Democratic Party.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We&rsquo;ve seen far too long the governor&rsquo;s rhetoric doesn&rsquo;t match his actions,&quot; said Wisniewski (D-Middlesex) during the Nov. 21 interview. &quot;While he talks about job creation, we don&#39;t see jobs being created in this state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt didn&rsquo;t take long for PolitiFact New Jersey to realize Wisniewski&rsquo;s claim made no sense.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state&rsquo;s economy may not be gaining as much speed as we&rsquo;d like, but the state has still seen an increase of nearly 40,000 private-sector jobs since January, according to the most recent seasonally adjusted data released by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s see how the labor statistics break down.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA few days before Wisniewski made his statement, state officials released preliminary employment figures for October.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCompared with October 2010, public-sector jobs saw a year-over-year decrease of 5,600. But that loss was offset by an increase of 28,100 private-sector jobs since October 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThus, total non-farm employment in October stood at 3,868,700, marking a year-over-year increase of 22,500 jobs, or about 0.6 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, what was Wisniewski talking about?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe assemblyman&rsquo;s communications director, Tim O&rsquo;Donovan, told us Wisniewski was referring to figures released last month. O&rsquo;Donovan pointed out how those figures show month-over-month decreases in total non-farm jobs in August and September.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the latest data was available when Wisniewski made the claim. Also, according to Rutgers economics professor Joseph Seneca, one month is not a good indicator of employment changes, because single events can distort a given month.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The standard approach would be to consider job changes over the past year (Oct 10 to Oct 11) or on a year to date basis (i.e. from Dec 10 through the latest month). Both of those measures indicate NJ is adding private sector jobs at a reasonable pace,&quot; Seneca told us in an email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The problem is that the recession losses were so large, the state has a long way to go to recover all the losses, but a start has been made in terms of private sector jobs,&quot; he added.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a statement, Wisniewski said: &quot;If the Ledger wants to credit the Governor with job creation when unemployment has barely budged over the past year that&#39;s out of my control, but, as far as I&#39;m concerned, it&#39;s far too premature to be giving anyone credit for creating jobs given our chronic unemployment and fragile economy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;re not saying Republican Gov. Chris Christie is responsible for this job growth, but it&rsquo;s worth noting that since he took office in January 2010, New Jersey has seen an increase of 41,600 private-sector jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBlasting Christie for his &quot;rhetoric&quot; about job creation, Wisniewski claimed &quot;we don&#39;t see jobs being created in this state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe economic recovery may not be moving fast enough, but New Jersey has seen an increase in total non-farm jobs over the last year, driven by growth in the private-sector. Wisniewski should know better than to suggest otherwise.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate this statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/11/politifact_nj_democratic_leade.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-23T13:50:36.009899", "ruling_date": "2011-11-28T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "John Wisniewski claims New Jersey is not seeing new jobs being created", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-wisniewski-claims-new-jersey-not-seeing-new-j", "ruling_link_text": "Private-sector is on the rise", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://watch.njtvonline.org/video/2169610304\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.2737697761184713\">NJToday interview with Assemblyman John Wisniewski</a>, Nov. 21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, <a href=\"http://lwd.state.nj.us/labor/lwdhome/press/20111117unemploymentrelease.html\">New Jersey Unemployment Rate Declines to 9.1%, Private Sector Adds 4,000 Jobs in October</a>, Nov. 17, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Tim O&rsquo;Donovan, communications director for Assemblyman John Wisniewski, Nov. 22, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, <a href=\"http://lwd.state.nj.us/labor/lwdhome/press/20111020_unemployment_release.html\">New Jersey Unemployment Rate Declines to 9.2 Percent</a>, Oct. 20, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Joseph Seneca,<a href=\"http://policy.rutgers.edu/faculty/seneca/\">Edward J.
