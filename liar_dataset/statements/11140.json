Right away, Petty Officer Ross Ruddell told us that the 350 number is an average. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An average of what, we asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a day of research, Ruddell got back to us with the numbers: 385 for 2014, 338 for 2013 and 427 for 2012. So based on those numbers, Ruddell pointed out, the average was actually 383 -- not 350.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which brings us to a second question: What does the Coast Guard mean by a life saved?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The organization, with a history dating to<strong> </strong>the U.S. Life-Saving Service in 1878, distinguishes between cases where people in peril were &quot;saved&quot; and other cases where individuals, even people with injuries, were &quot;assisted.&quot; &nbsp;So the Coast Guard does not tally a life saved every time it tows in a vessel with mechanical trouble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fair enough. We&rsquo;ll accept the way they tally a life saved. And we have not tried to audit that number. What&rsquo;s odd is the way the Coast Guard keeps using the number 350 in its news releases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a 2012 news release, a public-affairs officer declared that the Coast Guard saves &quot;more than 350 lives&quot; in the Northeast &quot;per year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a news release in 2013, the agency claimed that it saves 350 lives &quot;each year.&quot; In 2014, it sent out a release saying, &quot;In an average year, the Coast Guard assists 3,300 lives and saves 350 lives across the Northeast.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And of course this summer, a news release concerning the fishing boat that sank 150 miles out at sea concluded: &quot;Every year the First Coast Guard District saves 350 lives in the Northeast.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not strictly correct. &nbsp;It was 385 lives saved in 2014, 338 lives saved in &nbsp;2013 and 427 lives saved in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its news release, the Coast Guard failed to say that 350 was an average, as they did in 2014. &nbsp;And the average for the past three years is 383 not 350. So the news release understates the value of the Coast Guard&rsquo;s work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The service is strong on the sea, weak in math. But because in two of the last three years the service saved more than 350 lives, we rate this claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/rulings/mostly-true/\"><strong>Mostly True</strong>.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>PolitiFact Rhode Island</u></a> to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
