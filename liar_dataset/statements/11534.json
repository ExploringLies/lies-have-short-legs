We found only a handful that surveyed people about candidates&rsquo; leadership qualities, and just one that asked respondents to compare candidates in terms of leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as polling goes, that&rsquo;s a fairly small sample. But Trump does have a point. Here&rsquo;s what we found:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/politics/washington-post-abc-news-poll-oct-15-18-2015/1852/\"><em>Washington Post</em>/ABC poll, conducted Oct. 15-18</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This poll asked Republican-leaning respondents who among six candidates is the strongest leader. Nearly half of respondents -- 47 percent -- selected Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twelve percent said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, followed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (11 percent), Carson (9 percent), Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (8 percent), and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina (6 percent).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This poll comes the closest to matching Trump&rsquo;s talking point: Nearly four times as many respondents said Trump is the strongest leader compared to Bush, the candidate with the next-highest results. However, this is the only poll we could find that asks people to choose the best leader among several candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump led the <em>Washington Post/</em>ABC poll overall with 32 percent support; Carson was second with 21 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/images/polling/us/us11042015_xsq33a.pdf\">Quinnipiac University poll, released Nov. 1</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This poll asked, &quot;Would you say that (candidate) has strong leadership qualities or not?&quot; When presented this question about Trump, 60 percent of respondents answered &quot;yes&quot; -- the highest percentage of yes answers. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie followed, each receiving 56 percent. Rubio and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., each received 48 percent. Carson got 47, and Cruz got the lowest with 45 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/284426064/CBS-News-poll-2016-Republican-presidential-campaign\">CBS News poll, released Oct. 11</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS asked Republican voters about various qualities held by the three outsider candidates: Trump, Carson and Fiorina. Among respondents, 84 percent said Trump has strong qualities of leadership. Carson followed, at 72 percent, and 60 percent said Fiorina has strong leadership qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/images/polling/us/us09242015_ui47mfb.pdf\">Quinnipiac poll, released Sept. 24</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the other Quinnipiac poll, this one asked, &quot;Would you say that (candidate) has strong leadership qualities or not?&quot; When presented this question about Trump, 58 percent of respondents answered &quot;yes&quot; -- the highest percentage of yes answers. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton followed, receiving 55 percent. Next was Vice President Joe Biden (54 percent), Bush (52 percent), Fiorina (52 percent), Carson (48 percent), and Sanders (45 percent).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Quinnipiac has released a few other polls that ask this question over the past few months, with similar results.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://patricklonergan.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/h44f810d9.jpg\">What about that CNN poll</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump specifically mentioned a CNN poll, but searching through Real Clear Politics&rsquo; collection and on the CNN website, we couldn&rsquo;t find one that asked about leadership qualities. We also reached out to Trump&rsquo;s campaign but didn&rsquo;t hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that in polls about 2016 candidate leadership skills, he comes out &quot;two and three and four times higher than anybody else.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only a few polls so far have asked about candidates&rsquo; leadership qualities, but Trump has a point that he usually comes out on top. One poll in particular supported Trump&rsquo;s claim: Compared to the candidate with the next-highest results, about four times as many people said Trump had the best leadership skills among a group of candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that was just one poll. Most polls have asked respondents to say whether each individual candidate has strong leadership qualities -- not comparing the candidates against each other. In these polls, Trump beats out his opponents by a handful of percentage points, not two, three or four times higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Trump&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-08T09:51:28.695253", "ruling_date": "2015-11-08T14:53:51", "ruling_headline": "Trump: 'My numbers on leadership, it\u2019s two or three or four times higher than anybody else'", "ruling_headline_slug": "trump-my-numbers-leadership-its-two-or-three-or-fo", "ruling_link_text": "Small sample size", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CNN, <em>State of the Union</em>, Nov. 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real Clear Politics, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html#polls\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Republican primary 2016 polls database</u></a>, accessed Nov. 8, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says that in polls about 2016 candidate leadership skills, he comes out &quot;two and three and four times higher than anybody else.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "comments on \"State of the Union\"", "statement_date": "2015-11-08", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 194, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/194/", "subject": "Polls and Public Opinion", "subject_slug": "polls", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
