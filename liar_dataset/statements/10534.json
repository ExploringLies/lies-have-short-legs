Scott Walker wants to cut from the University of Wisconsin System includes an estimated $114 million reduction for the flagship University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We can&#39;t handle this,&quot; UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank has said. &quot;It&#39;s not good for the university. It&#39;s not good for the state. These are simply too big.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2015/feb/17/scott-walkers-university-budget-cuts-13-25-16-mayb/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>established</u></a> that there are different ways to present the size of the $300 million, a two-year cut that would be made across the 26-campus system as part of Walker&rsquo;s 2015-&rsquo;17 state budget. There&rsquo;s a measure of truth in figures that range from 2.5 percent to 13 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about the effect on <a href=\"http://www.wisc.edu/about/facts/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>UW-Madison</u></a>, home to 43,000 students and nearly 22,000 faculty and staff (not to mention more than 400,000 living alumni)?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a Feb. 12, 2015 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a046UcwlukI\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>public meeting</u></a> on Walker&rsquo;s plan, Blank said the reduction would put the campus in a serious financial predicament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As many of you know, we got a budget cut two years ago. ... We were told to spend down our reserves, rather than acknowledging that budget cut,&quot; Blank said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So, we have spent down reserves in the last two years and ... I have no more reserves to spend down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll check both parts of Blank&rsquo;s claim -- that two years ago, UW-Madison &quot;spent down reserves&quot; as it was told to, and now it has &quot;no more reserves to spend down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The reserves backdrop</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of this stems from a report issued by the nonpartisan state fiscal bureau in April 2013 that revealed the UW System had quietly amassed $648 million in <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2013/apr/23/examining-university-wisconsin-system-slush-fund-i/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>reserves</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact-checking a claim by the system&rsquo;s president at the time, we found the amount was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/08/kevin-reilly/uw-systems-reserves-fair-middling-system-president/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>roughly in line</u></a> with some comparable university systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, Walker and many fellow Republicans in the Legislature were outraged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The schools had built up their reserves over a period of years while they were also raising tuition -- and, in the opinion of many, had not been up front in doing so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&quot;Spend down&quot;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first part of the claim made by Blank -- who was President Barack Obama&rsquo;s acting commerce secretrary until coming to Madison three months after the bombshell report -- is UW-Madison spent down its reserves after being told two years ago to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no explicit order to UW-Madison -- or the other UW System schools -- to trim their reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, in effect, there was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report disclosing the size of the reserves was issued as Walker and lawmakers were fashioning the 2013-&rsquo;15 state budget. They responded swiftly, <a href=\"http://profs.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/UWS-Operating-Budget-2013-14.pdf\">instituting</a> a $66 million budget cut to the UW System and a two-year tuition freeze. The freeze amounted to a $40 million hit, given that the schools had already planned tuition increases and incorporated that revenue into their own budgets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The message was clear, if indirect: Reduce your reserves. And pressure was applied with the budget squeeze -- cutting state aid on the one hand and eliminating the ability to raise tuition revenue on the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UW System&rsquo;s most recent <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/jfc/reports/Documents/2014_10_16_UWS%20Program%20Revenue%20Balances.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>assessment</u></a> of reserves, or so-called fund balances, was produced in October 2014. That assessment showed UW-Madison had total reserves of nearly $387 million, down from nearly $420 million a year earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reserves left</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second part of Blank&rsquo;s claim is UW-Madison has &quot;no more reserves to spend down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s an overstatement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, there are reserves, and there are reserves. Most are defined as &quot;designated,&quot; &quot;planned&quot; or obligated&quot; -- that is, they are earmarked in some way. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/blank-to-address-proposed-budget-cuts-at-regents-meeting-b99439791z1-290947951.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Blank</u></a> herself is saying UW-Madison has $54 million in what the school <a href=\"http://budget.wisc.edu/budget-news/uw-madison-budget-faqs/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>describes</u></a> as discretionary reserves -- &quot;fund balances not already committed to payments.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, of the $387 million in total reserves, there is $54 million in discretionary cash. That&rsquo;s arguably a tiny amount for an institution that has a nearly $3 billion total budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, $54 million would go a significant way toward covering the estimated $114 million, over two years, from Walker&rsquo;s proposed budget cuts. And in any case, it isn&rsquo;t zero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blank says UW-Madison &quot;spent down reserves&quot; as it was told to do two years ago and, facing new state budget cuts, has &quot;no more reserves to spend down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With rhethoric and actions taken with the 2013-&rsquo;15 state budget, Walker and the Legislature made it clear to UW-Madison and other UW System campuses that they needed to tap their reserves. And UW-Madison did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Blank, objecting to even larger cuts in state aid now being proposed by Walker, goes too far in saying UW-Madison has no reserves, given that, at a minimum, $54 million in &quot;discretionary reserves&quot; are available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>------</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>More on Scott Walker</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#39;s Scott Walker page</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-02-20T14:19:27.949798", "ruling_date": "2015-02-20T14:51:16", "ruling_headline": "With Scott Walker's $300 million budget cut looming, UW-Madison says it doesn't have reserves to tap", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walkers-300-million-budget-cut-looming-uw-ma", "ruling_link_text": "Spent down; more left", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a046UcwlukI\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>video</u></a> of University of Wisconsin-Madison budget forum (quote at 7:15), Feb. 12, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2015/feb/17/scott-walkers-university-budget-cuts-13-25-16-mayb/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Scott Walker&rsquo;s university budget cuts -- how big?&quot;</u></a> (article) Feb. 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/08/kevin-reilly/uw-systems-reserves-fair-middling-system-president/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;UW Systems reserves fair to middling, system president says,&quot;</u></a> (Half True)&quot; May 8, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, University of Wisconsin-Madison spokesman Greg Bump, Feb. 18, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of Wisconsin System, <a href=\"http://profs.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/UWS-Operating-Budget-2013-14.pdf\">2013-&rsquo;14 operating budget</a>, July 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of Wisconsin-Madison, <a href=\"http://budget.wisc.edu/budget-news/uw-madison-budget-faqs/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;UW-Madison budget FAQs,&quot;</u></a> Feb. 14, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/blank-to-address-proposed-budget-cuts-at-regents-meeting-b99439791z1-290947951.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;UW-Madison chancellor fears cuts will hurt competitiveness,&quot;</u></a> Feb. 5, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/2-years-after-outcry-uw-fund-balances-remain-largely-unchanged-b99365722z1-278281041.html?ipad=y\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> &quot;2 years after outcry, UW System much clearer about reserves,&quot;</u></a> Oct. 6, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Joint Committee on Finance, University of Wisconsin System <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/jfc/reports/Documents/2014_10_16_UWS%20Program%20Revenue%20Balances.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>report</u></a> to the committee, Oct. 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of Wisconsin-Madison, <a href=\"http://www.news.wisc.edu/23180\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>news release</u></a>, Oct. 6, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Gov.
