Scott Walker&rsquo;s first term was marked by a flood of pro-business legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Walker poised to start a second term in January 2015, the state&rsquo;s leading business lobby -- Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce -- wants Walker and Republicans to press further in the name of creating a better business climate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tops on the legislative agenda for the group, at least based on a Dec. 8, 2014 <a href=\"http://wisopinion.com/index.iml?mdl=article.mdl&amp;article=58428\">opinion piece</a> by its president and CEO Kurt Bauer, is so-called right-to-work legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Should joining a private-sector union be voluntary as it is in 24 states or should it be mandatory?&quot; Bauer wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added: &quot;Beyond the personal freedom component to this debate is the economic development argument. It is well-known that site selectors who decide where businesses expand or relocate shun closed shop states like Wisconsin in favor of Right to Work states like Iowa, Indiana and Michigan.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iowa&rsquo;s right to work law dates to 1947. Indiana and Michigan approved the change in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One four-letter word caught our attention in Bauer&rsquo;s piece: &quot;shun.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Wisconsin getting shut out of business expansion because it allows private employers to sign contracts with unions that require all covered employees to join the union?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A closer look</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started by asking Bauer about the term &quot;site selectors.&quot; Bauer told us it refers to CEOs and consulting firms who help companies search for new locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He pointed to a 2012 survey of U.S. corporate executives regarding factors they consider when choosing sites for expansion or relocation. In that <a href=\"http://www.areadevelopment.com/Corporate-Consultants-Survey-Results/Q1-2013/27th-Corporate-Executive-RE-survey-results-37376241.shtml?Page=2\">survey by Area Development magazine</a>, 72 percent said it was important or very important that a state has passed &quot;right-to-work&quot; legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bauer noted that in a <a href=\"http://www.areadevelopment.com/laborEducation/November2012/RTW-union-profile-manufacturing-location-factors-2716141.shtml\">November 2012 article </a>in the magazine, one consultant estimated that three-fourths of his firm&rsquo;s clients want only locations that are in right-to-work states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That kind of anecdotal evidence was mentioned repeatedly by site-search consultants quoted in the magazine, as well as in another publication, Site Selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estimates vary on the strength of the preference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>States will be eliminated at the first stage in &quot;about half&quot; of projects, one consultant told <a href=\"http://www.siteselection.com/issues/2013/jan/selectors-survey.cfm\">Site Selection</a>. After Michigan passed right to work, another consultant told the publication that &quot;it will get Michigan a few more looks on site searches, mostly industrial ones. It&rsquo;s hard to know what percentage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some consultants say manufacturing companies are more likely to steer clear of unions when compared to firms in other sectors. Wisconsin is a manufacturing-rich state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Area Development magazine framed the right to work debate this way: Businesses tend to support right-to-work because it makes unionization less likely and in turn often means lower labor costs. Unions oppose them because right to work weakens union membership and wages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In a right-to-work state, any worker choosing not to join the union or pay for the services still gets the benefits,&quot; the magazine noted. &quot;Unions often refer to those workers as &lsquo;free riders,&rsquo; and because wages tend to be lower in right-to-work states, unions famously refer to the concept as &lsquo;right-to-work for less.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While &quot;shun&quot; suggests Wisconsin simply loses out when businesses are deciding where to build, even a quick peek at the state jobs agency&rsquo;s website yields examples to the contrary. Global food ingredients company Kerry expanded here as did Seneca Foods; Plexus Corp. built a global headquarters in Neenah; Amazon is opening a new facility in Kenosha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation &quot;does not track whether unionization or Right to Work Laws are a factor in a company&rsquo;s decision to relocate or expand in Wisconsin,&quot; jobs agency spokesman Mark Maley said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same 2010 article Bauer cited noted that &quot;choosing a state with a low-union profile or locating in a (right to work) state only ranked 10th and 12th respectively among a list of 26 different site selection factors,&quot; according to Area Development&rsquo;s 26th Annual Corporate Survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the most recent Area Development survey, <a href=\"http://www.areadevelopment.com/laborEducation/Q4-2013/low-union-profile-site-selection-factors-2628151.shtml\">published in 2013</a>, these factors were ahead of union issues: taxes, availability of buildings, energy costs, building costs, telecommunications infrastructure, skilled workforce, highway connections, government investment in workforce development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bauer acknowledged many factors can come into play when businesses make such decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responses from his group&rsquo;s own <a href=\"https://www.wmc.org/news/press-releases/steady-economic-and-job-growth-predicted-by-state-business-leaders/\">survey of members</a> show that some executives are concerned about the lack of a right to work law. But the number (15 percent) was well short of a majority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In past years, the WMC did not ask specifically about attitudes toward unionization. But that changed in 2014,<a href=\"https://www.wmc.org/news/press-releases/steady-economic-and-job-growth-predicted-by-state-business-leaders/\"> the group said</a>. Some 260 executives participated in the survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When asked what one thing state government can do to improve Wisconsin&rsquo;s business climate, 35 percent said reduce taxes, 15 percent said become a Right to Work state and 14 percent said reform employment laws, like harmonizing the state and federal versions of family medical leave,&quot; a WMC news release noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce said: &quot;Site selectors who decide where businesses expand or relocate shun closed shop states like Wisconsin in favor of Right to Work states like Iowa, Indiana and Michigan.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s anecdotal evidence that some firms screen out states without right to work laws when seeking to expand, and surveys of site selectors say this issue is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But its far down the list of top concerns for many site selectors, suggesting that &quot;shun&quot; is too strong a term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-12-15T16:44:54.262661", "ruling_date": "2014-12-17T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "WMC\u2019s Kurt Bauer says businesses favor \u2018right-to-work\u2019 states when looking for expansion sites", "ruling_headline_slug": "wmcs-kurt-bauer-says-businesses-favor-right-work-s", "ruling_link_text": "Dealbreaker for some, way down the list for others", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce,<a href=\"http://wisopinion.com/index.iml?mdl=article.mdl&amp;article=58428\"> &quot;Continuing Wisconsin&rsquo;s era of reform,&quot;</a> by Kurt Bauer, Dec. 8, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Kurt Bauer, president/CEO, Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, Dec. 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails with Mark Maley, spokesman, Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, Dec. 12, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails with Karen Hickey, spokeswoman, state AFL-CIO, Dec. 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Area Development magazine, <a href=\"http://www.areadevelopment.com/laborEducation/November2012/RTW-union-profile-manufacturing-location-factors-2716141.shtml\">&quot;Right to Work/Low union-profile states: Making or Breaking a Deal,&quot;</a> November 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Area Development magazine,<a href=\"http://www.areadevelopment.com/laborEducation/Q4-2013/low-union-profile-site-selection-factors-2628151.shtml\"> &quot;Critical Location Factor #10: Union Activity Can Be a Deal Breaker,&quot;</a> Fall 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce,<a href=\"https://www.wmc.org/news/press-releases/steady-economic-and-job-growth-predicted-by-state-business-leaders/\"> press release</a> about July 2014 survey, July 21, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Site Selection magazine,<a href=\"http://www.siteselection.com/issues/2013/jan/selectors-survey.cfm\"> &quot;What Makes a Business Climate Good?&quot;</a> January 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 818, "last_name": "Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mugs_mug-independentgroup______________________________.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/818/", "total_count": 7, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.wmc.org/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Site selectors who decide where businesses expand or relocate shun closed shop states like Wisconsin in favor of Right to Work states like Iowa, Indiana and Michigan.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an opinion piece", "statement_date": "2014-12-08", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 103, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/103/", "subject": "Workers", "subject_slug": "workers", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
