Jim Doyle, the Wisconsin Republican Party declared:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The only time over the last 25 years when the state&rsquo;s unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. average was when Burke was commerce secretary.&quot; We rated the claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/14/republican-party-wisconsin/1988-wisconsin-unemployment-rate-greater-us-rate-o/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mostly True</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dating back to 1988, there were 15 months when Wisconsin&rsquo;s unemployment rate was higher, all during Burke&rsquo;s time running Commerce under Doyle. The GOP&rsquo;s claim only indirectly blamed Burke and we noted that other factors, such as trends in the U.S. economy, affect state unemployment rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interview on June 23, 2014, however, Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki said the state unemployment rate exceeded the national rate for only three months while Burke ran Commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s reboot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reviewing the rates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During Zepecki&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.themic921.com/onair/the-devils-advocates-47215/joe-zepecki-campaign-director-for-gubernatorial-mary-burke-12493333/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview</u></a> on &quot;The Devil&rsquo;s Advocates,&quot; a talk show on WXXM-FM (92.1) in Madison, the two co-hosts and Zepecki talked about Burke and Gov. Scott Walker in terms of job creation and unemployment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a portion of the exchange:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Co-host Mike Crute:</strong> &quot;Well, back when Mary Burke was the commerce secretary, I believe 2006-2007, Joe, the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent. Of course, they (Republicans) want to say, &#39;higher than the national average,&#39; for the short time Mary was in that position. But at 4.7 percent, I mean, that is pretty much full employment when she was commerce secretary.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Burke actually was commerce secretary from February 2005 to November 2007.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Zepecki:</strong> &quot;It is, and it was three months, three individual months within her two and a half years where I believe the unemployment rate here was about a tenth of a percentage point higher. Again, this is what they&rsquo;re doing, just trying to play fast and loose and lay out ways to obscure (Walker&rsquo;s) failures on jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted Zepecki, he began his email response by saying: &quot;I got this one wrong.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zepecki said he made his claim based on his recollection of a chart produced by the state GOP that compared Wisconsin and U.S. unemployment rates during Burke&rsquo;s time at Commerce. He said the chart seemed to show three periods of time when Wisconsin&rsquo;s rate exceeded the U.S. rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he didn&rsquo;t disagree, as we found in fact-checking the GOP&rsquo;s claim, that U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show Wisconsin&rsquo;s rate was higher for 15 months of Burke&rsquo;s 33-month tenure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that, even when Wisconsin&rsquo;s rate exceeded the national rate, it was by less than one-half of 1 percentage point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zepecki said the Wisconsin unemployment rate was higher than the U.S. rate during only three months when Mary Burke was state commerce secretary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s rate was never more than fourth-tenths of a percentage point higher than the U.S. rate, but it did exceed the U.S. rate for nearly half of of Burke&rsquo;s 33 months running Commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-06-30T18:58:16.774183", "ruling_date": "2014-07-06T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin unemployment rarely above U.S. when Mary Burke was commerce chief, her spokesman says", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-unemployment-rarely-above-us-when-mary-b", "ruling_link_text": "Actually, 15 months", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>&quot;The Devil&rsquo;s Advocates,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.themic921.com/onair/the-devils-advocates-47215/joe-zepecki-campaign-director-for-gubernatorial-mary-burke-12493333/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview</u></a> with Joe Zepecki (quote at 7:10), June 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview and email interview, Mary Burke campaign communications director Joe Zepecki, June 26, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/14/republican-party-wisconsin/1988-wisconsin-unemployment-rate-greater-us-rate-o/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Since 1988, Wisconsin unemployment rate greater than U.S. rate only when Mary Burke held state commerce post, GOP says,</u></a>&quot; Feb. 14, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Joe", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 2840, "last_name": "Zepecki", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "joe-zepecki", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Joe_Zepecki.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2840/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>The Wisconsin unemployment rate was higher than the U.S. rate during only three months when Mary Burke was state commerce secretary.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview", "statement_date": "2014-06-23", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 147, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/147/", "subject": "States", "subject_slug": "states", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
