Dick Black, R-Loudoun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A staunch opponent of abortion, Black is seeking to link the controversy to his Democratic opponent this fall, Jill McCabe, a pediatric emergency room physician.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCabe &quot;supports selling late term abortions for bigger body parts,&quot; Black tweeted on July 28. He renewed the charge on Aug. 4, tweeting that McCabe &quot;supports late term abortions. Larger baby parts are more profitable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we decided to examine Black&rsquo;s charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with some background. The controversy over fetal parts erupted last month when the Center for Medical Progress, a conservative group that opposes abortion, released a nine-minute video secretly taped during a 2014 lunch with Deborah Nucatola, Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s senior director of medical services. The center says the tape shows Nucatola talking about performing partial-birth abortions to keep body parts intact in order to &quot;sell&quot; them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The video put Planned Parenthood on the defensive and ignited Republican calls to end federal funding for the group and for investigations into its practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planned Parenthood provides a wide array of health services to women -- 97 percent of which are not related to abortions. The organization has denounced the secret taping as a misleading campaign by anti-abortion activists. Officials of the group say fetal tissues are integral to medical research and that the organization does not profit from their sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allegations by Black and others that profits were made raise legal questions. Federal law bars clinics from selling fetal tissue for gain. It&rsquo;s legal, however, for clinics to donate the tissue for scientific research and receive reimbursement for their &quot;reasonable&quot; costs in providing the tissue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cecile Richards, CEO of Planned Parenthood, has said the organization&rsquo;s clinics don&rsquo;t sell fetal tissue for profit but do provide it for research and are reimbursed for their collection costs. In the video, Nucatola discusses fees of $30 to $100 per specimen provided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University&rsquo;s Langone Medical Center, told PolitiFact National that the fees Nucatola discusses don&rsquo;t appear geared to making a profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the sales are made to brokers -- middlemen who process the tissue and then sell it to researchers at significant markups. A vial of highly concentrated fetal liver cells, for example, can sell for about $24,000. The brokers say their prices reflect their high costs of buying medical equipment and employing skilled technicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, let&rsquo;s get back to Black&rsquo;s claim that McCabe supports selling fetal tissue for profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris Lore, Black&rsquo;s legislative assistant, told us the senator&rsquo;s statement isn&rsquo;t based on any statement from McCabe explicitly supporting the practice. Instead, Lore said, it&rsquo;s implicit by the support she&rsquo;s received from Planned Parenthood.The group has endorsed McCabe and has given her a 100 percent rating. Lore also noted McCabe has been endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to those endorsements, Lore noted that amid the controversy, McCabe was quoted in a newspaper saying she still supports Planned Parenthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You take those two facts into consideration and it seems her position is pretty clear,&quot; Lore said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lore forwarded a copy of a Loudoun Times-Mirror story in which McCabe was asked about whether she still welcomed Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s support in the wake of the controversy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m a doctor, and I take care of patients, including women,&quot; McCabe was quoted as saying. &quot;Women need health care choices and Planned Parenthood provides that. That&#39;s kind of the end of it for me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted Lore a second time for more information. After we spoke with him, Black posted this message on Twitter: &quot;PolitiFact is desperate to give cover to @DrJillMcCabe to give cover for supporting late term abortions. #MediaLies #PPSellsBabyParts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also reached out to McCabe to see what her position was on late term abortions and selling tissue for a profit. We heard back from Kyle Sutton, her campaign manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Jill McCabe does not support late term abortions, but as a doctor she does understand that there are unfortunately circumstances where a pregnancy proceeding to full-term is not in the best health interest of either a mother, or child,&quot; Sutton wrote in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;What about selling fetal tissue for profit?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Jill does not support selling fetal tissue for profit, the same way she does not support any illegal activities, because they&#39;re illegal,&quot; Sutton wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also asked McCabe if she supports Planned Parenthood providing tissue for research at cost, without a profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As a doctor, Jill McCabe understands life-saving medical research,&quot; her campaign manager wrote in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an Aug. 1 <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/planned-parenthood-stings-revive-talk-of-abortion-on-virginia-campaign-trail/2015/08/01/a9b508ee-36eb-11e5-9739-170df8af8eb9_story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>story</u></a> in the Washington Post story said McCabe said she had seen the Planned Parenthood videos and found them &quot;concerning.&quot; But the newspaper also quoted her saying that &quot;Planned Parenthood is an important organization that provides vital services.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sen. Dick Black says McCabe, &quot;supports late term abortions. Larger baby parts are more profitable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCabe indicates she supports late term abortions in instances when it is &quot;in the best health interest&quot; of the mother or child. She says she opposes the sale of fetal tissue for profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Black links McCabe&rsquo;s qualified support for late term abortions to what he says is an effort to profit from the sale of &quot;large baby parts.&quot; &nbsp;In effect, he&rsquo;s accusing his opponent of supporting an illegal practice because U.S. law bans the sale of fetal tissue for profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s incumbent of Black to prove his inflammatory claim and he offers nothing but speculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his statement Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-08-10T11:26:27.329815", "ruling_date": "2015-08-10T11:28:57", "ruling_headline": "Dick Black says Jill McCabe backs selling fetal parts for profit", "ruling_headline_slug": "black-says-jill-mccabe-backs-selling-fetal-parts-p", "ruling_link_text": "No proof", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Sen.
