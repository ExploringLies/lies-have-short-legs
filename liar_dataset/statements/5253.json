Chris Christie is calling dibs: the Giants are New Jersey&rsquo;s team, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The only thing New York about the Giants is the &lsquo;NY&rsquo; on their helmets. They train in New Jersey, they play in New Jersey and most of their players live in New Jersey,&quot; he said during a Jan. 22 &nbsp;interview on NBC&rsquo;s &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; The Giants defeated the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football Conference championship game later that day, securing their spot in Super Bowl XLVI.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe day after, Christie told reporters at a news conference: &quot;It&#39;s great to have one of the state&rsquo;s two football teams in the Super Bowl. As you know, I root for the Jets over the Giants, but, you know, it&#39;s great for the Giants to be there and it&#39;s good for New Jersey. And so I&#39;m thrilled to have one of New Jersey&#39;s teams in the Super Bowl. And look forward to two weeks from yesterday. And you can be sure I will be rooting hard for the New Jersey Giants.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs fans gear up for the Giants&rsquo; fifth Super Bowl appearance, PolitiFact New Jersey decided to test Christie&rsquo;s three claims: the Giants &quot;train in New Jersey, they play in New Jersey and most of their players live in New Jersey.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe self-declared Jets&rsquo; fan has his Giants&rsquo; facts pretty straight, we found.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince 1976, the Giants -- a team that started in New York in 1925 -- have played in a stadium in East Rutherford. In 2010, the team moved into the new MetLife Stadium, which they share with the New York Jets.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Timex Performance Center, the Giants&rsquo; practice facility, opened in 2009 in East Rutherford. The team practices there in the regular season.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe team had held its summer training camp at the University at Albany since 1996. But this summer, because of a labor dispute between players and the National Football League that shortened the off-season, the Giants trained at their East Rutherford facility.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt was the first time the camp was held in New Jersey since the team was &nbsp;at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison from 1988 to 1995. &nbsp;But John Mara, the Giants president and CEO, said in July that the team had &quot;every intention&quot; of returning this summer to Albany.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the Giants play in New Jersey. And, at least this year, they practiced entirely in New Jersey. But where do the players live?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGiants spokesman Pat Hanlon told us in an e-mail that the <a href=\"http://www.giants.com/team/roster.html\">entire roster</a> calls the Garden State home during football season.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf the 53 players on the active roster, PolitiFact New Jersey found 23 players who have a New Jersey address, own a home in New Jersey or have registered to vote in New Jersey, according to a public records search.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie claimed the New York Giants are New Jersey&rsquo;s team. &quot;They train in New Jersey, they play in New Jersey and most of their players live in New Jersey,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Giants have called East Rutherford home since 1976 and started playing in its current stadium in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor 15 years the team held its summer training camp at the University at Albany, but this year&rsquo;s camp was held in New Jersey at the team&rsquo;s regular-season training facility. And every player on the team&rsquo;s current roster calls New Jersey home during football season, according to a Giants spokesman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll leave the debate on whether that makes the Giants New Jersey&rsquo;s team to gridiron fans, but we rate Christie&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/01/politifact_nj_are_the_new_york.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-26T16:48:49.831713", "ruling_date": "2012-01-29T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie says New York Giants are New Jersey\u2019s team", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-says-new-york-giants-are-new-jersey", "ruling_link_text": "Big Blue calls Garden State home", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tMeet the Press, <a href=\"http://video.msnbc.msn.com/meet-the-press/46090673\">Interview with Gov.
