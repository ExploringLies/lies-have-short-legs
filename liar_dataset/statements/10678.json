Mike Pence, a Republican, has had to defend the law against those who say it discriminates against gays and lesbians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former Gov. Jeb Bush sided with Pence in a radio interview on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think Gov.&nbsp;Pence has done the right thing,&quot; Bush <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/jeb-bush-praises-indiana-law-under-attack-as-anti-gay-and/2223503\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>said</u></a> in a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt on<strong> </strong>March 30. &quot;Florida has a law like this. Bill Clinton signed a law like this at the federal level. This is simply allowing people of faith space to be able to express their beliefs, to be able to be people of conscience. I just think once the facts are established, people aren&rsquo;t going to see this as discriminatory at all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How similar is the Florida law to the Indiana law, or the federal law before that? When we reached out to Bush&rsquo;s office, they reiterated that Bush was describing the laws as &quot;very similar.&quot; We decided to delve into the evidence for a complete picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>After federal law struck down, Florida&rsquo;s law followed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s controversy goes back to 1993, when Clinton signed into law the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The law&rsquo;s intent was to protect religious practices from government interference, such as whether a Muslim prison guard could wear a beard, or Native Americans could use peyote as part of the religious practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law didn&rsquo;t apply to states, which kicked off a spree of about 19 states passing their own versions of the law. In 1998, a year before Bush took office, the Florida Legislature passed the <a href=\"http://laws.flrules.org/node/1022\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Florida Religious Freedom Restoration Act</u></a>&nbsp;with broad support and little media attention. Both the American Civil Liberties Union and the Christian Coalition backed it.&nbsp;It became law without Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles signature.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida&rsquo;s law stated, &quot;the government shall not substantially burden a person&rsquo;s exercise of religion.&quot; To be clear, it made no mention of same-sex marriage or gay rights. (Neither does the Indiana law.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, state officials seemed most concerned about the protections they would have to provide prisoners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We had one prisoner who wanted conjugal visits because he said his religion commanded him to &#39;go forth and multiply,&rsquo; &quot;&#39; said Marty Moore, deputy general counsel for Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth, to the <em>Lakeland Ledger</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, churches and ministers have used the law to argue that they shouldn&rsquo;t be subject to zoning laws or other actions from local government. They haven&rsquo;t found much success due to &quot;hostile judicial interpretation,&quot; said University of Virginia professor Douglas Laycock. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one case, <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-11th-circuit/1643243.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Temple B&rsquo;Nai Zion</u></a> in Sunny Isles Beach -- a city in Miami-Dade County -- used the Florida law to challenge a decision by the city to designate their 1964 building as historic. The temple&rsquo;s owners said the designation would stifle expansion plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lawsuit was dismissed by a Miami federal judge but reinstated by a federal appeals court. In 2014, the temple and the city reached a settlement that kept the historic designation but allowed some expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Differences in text and context</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, the context for Indiana&rsquo;s law is different. Courts have been striking down same-sex marriage bans, including in Indiana, and the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the constitutionality of the bans this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Pence signed Indiana&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://iga.in.gov/static-documents/9/2/b/a/92bab197/SB0101.05.ENRS.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>law</u></a> in a private ceremony, people who work for groups that oppose same-sex marriage were in attendance. One of the lobbyists, Eric Miller of Advance America, <a href=\"http://www.advanceamerica.com/blog/?p=1849\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>heralded the state&rsquo;s law</u></a> as protecting Christian bakers, florists and photographers from penalty &quot;for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage, among other examples.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to that context, there are differences in the texts of Florida&rsquo;s 1998 law and Indiana&rsquo;s recent law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indiana&rsquo;s law says the law can be used to protect religious freedom in private disputes, even if the government is not a party. Florida&rsquo;s law has no such language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the Indiana text:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;A person whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened, or is likely to be substantially burdened, by a violation of this chapter may assert the violation or impending violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indiana&rsquo;s law seems to be written to specifically cover a situation such as the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/jul/08/tony-perkins/wedding-vendors-have-been-forced-participate-same-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>New Mexico photographer</u></a> who did not want to participate in a same-sex wedding, said Caroline Mala Corbin, a University of Miami constitutional law professor. The New Mexico Supreme Court <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/22/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-talks-duck-dynasty-wedding-vendors/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>ruled</u></a> against the photographer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indiana&rsquo;s law follows the Supreme Court case about Hobby Lobby, in which the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/us/hobby-lobby-case-supreme-court-contraception.html?emc=edit_au_20140630&amp;nl=afternoonupdate&amp;nlid=57271995\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>court ruled</u></a> that the federal law protects family owned corporations from being forced to offer insurance that covers contraception under the health care law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Indiana&rsquo;s law, a &quot;person&quot; is extended to mean &quot;a partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association&quot; or other entity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Unlike the federal and Florida RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act), the Indiana one explicitly covers for-profit corporations,&quot; Corbin said. &quot;It&rsquo;s still an open question as to whether Florida&rsquo;s RFRA extends to any for-profit corporation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of Minnesota law professor Dale Carpenter pointed to two more differences between the laws in Florida and Indiana:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;The Florida law specifically excludes claims made under the state&#39;s drug abuse prevention and control law (<a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0800-0899/0893/0893ContentsIndex.html&amp;StatuteYear=2012&amp;Title=-%3E2012-%3EChapter%20893\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Chapter 893</u></a>), which means you can&rsquo;t get a religious exemption to drug laws in Florida. The Indiana law has no such limitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp; The Florida law requires that a person&#39;s religious exercise must be burdened before a claim can be made. The Indiana law says that it need only to be &quot;likely to be substantially burdened.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Robin Fretwell Wilson, professor and director of the family law and policy program at the University of Illinois College of Law, said Florida and Indiana share something in common: Neither has a statewide ban against LGBT discrimination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of the Indiana law, Bush said that Florida &quot;has a law like this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida did pass its own version of the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. But the laws and the context for their passage are different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indiana&rsquo;s law says government doesn&rsquo;t have to be a party to the case, and it extends protections to corporations, and that&rsquo;s different from Florida&rsquo;s law.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush&#39;s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.&nbsp;We rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-03-31T16:18:16.179892", "ruling_date": "2015-03-31T16:49:31", "ruling_headline": "Does Florida have a Religious Freedom Restoration Act like Indiana's?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-florida-have-religious-freedom-restoration-ac", "ruling_link_text": "Different text on private parties, persons", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Hugh Hewitt, <a href=\"http://www.hughhewitt.com/jeb-bush-on-the-indiana-law-iran-and-hillary/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Jeb Bush on the Indiana law, Iran and Hillary,&quot; </u></a>March 30, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida Archives, <a href=\"http://laws.flrules.org/node/1022\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Florida Religious Freedom Restoration Act</u></a>, 1998</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Conference of State Legislatures, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/state-rfra-statutes.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts</u></a>,&quot; March 13, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.indianahouserepublicans.com/clientuploads/PDF/RFRA/RFRA.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Letter</u></a> from law professors to Indiana Senate Judiciary Committee, Feb. 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://iga.in.gov/static-documents/9/2/b/a/92bab197/SB0101.05.ENRS.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Enrolled Indiana Senate Act 101</u></a>, accessed March 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indiana Senate Republicans, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.indianasenaterepublicans.com/blog/2015/03/26/general/protecting-religious-freedom/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Protecting religious freedom</u></a>,&quot; March 26, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Chicago Tribune</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-indiana-illinois-religious-objections-met-20150327-story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Illinois law on religious objection balanced by discrimination ban</u></a>,&quot; March 27, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Human Rights Campaign blog, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/hrc-to-governor-pence-no-phony-clarifications-of-s.b.-101\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>HRC to Governor Pence: No Phony &quot;Clarifications&quot; of S.B. 101</u></a>,&quot; March 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ilga.gov/Senate/transcripts/Strans90/ST051398.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Session transcript</u></a> from Illinois&rsquo; 90th General Assembly, March 13, 1998</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Case Western Law Review <a href=\"http://law.case.edu/journals/LawReview/Documents/Digital%20Wilson%20Article.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>article</u></a> by Robin Fretwell Wilson, &quot;Marriage of Necessity: Same-Sex Marriage and Religious Liberty Protections,&quot; spring 2014 (see table A2: State-Wide Sexual Orientation Nondiscrimination Measures)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Conference of State Legislatures, <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/state-rfra-statutes.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>States with Religious Freedom Restoration Acts</u></a> and <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/2015-state-rfra-legislation.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2015 State Religious Freedom Restoration Act legislation</u></a>, accessed March 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advance America, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.advanceamerica.com/blog/?p=1849\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Victory at the state house</u></a>!&quot; March 26, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statement from Lambda Legal, &quot;Lambda Legal to Gov.
