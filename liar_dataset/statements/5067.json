Bill Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) doesn&rsquo;t want that to happen.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring a Nov. 16 House hearing, Pascrell spoke against the proposed National Right-To-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011. If H.R. 822 becomes law, states that allow people to carry concealed weapons would be required to recognize other states&rsquo; valid concealed carry permits. At least 40 states already have some form of reciprocity for out-of-state concealed carry permits. The bill has been referred in the Senate to the Committee on the Judiciary.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn opposing the bill, Pascrell said, &quot;We haven&#39;t had any legislation which took away one gun in the past 20 years from anybody in this country -- not one.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPascrell&rsquo;s spokesman, Paul Brubaker said the congressman was specifically referring to federal legislation, noting that his &quot;point would have beeen clearer had he specified that he was referring to nonviolent, law-abiding gun owners.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey found Pascrell&rsquo;s argument somewhat on target.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut two gun-rights organizations we spoke with say two laws do take guns from people.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLarry Pratt, executive director of Virginia-based Gun Owners of America, and Joe Waldron, legislative director for the Washington state-based Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, both said a provision of The Violent&nbsp;Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned semiautomatic weapons with detachable devices. That, in effect, takes a weapon away from someone who wants it, they said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrubaker disagreed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The 1994 federal assault weapons ban prohibited for 10 years the possession, transfer, and manufacturing of semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices,&quot; Brubaker said in an email. &quot;However, there was a grandfather clause in the bill, and semiautomatic assault weapons that were legally-owned before the ban went into effect were NOT restricted. Those weapons could be transferred and sold within the confines of federal and state laws. &hellip; Neither the assault weapons ban, nor any federal prohibition of particular guns from being imported, resulted in the federal government taking legally-owned guns away from Americans.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWaldron also pointed to The Domestic Violence Gun Ban, more commonly called the Lautenberg Amendment for its author, Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ). The amendment to the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997 bans anyone convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense from owning or possessing a firearm, even if the person had it&nbsp;before the conviction. The law requires that person to immediately surrender the weapon &ndash; but not necessarily to law enforcement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat person&rsquo;s gun and ammunition should be transferred &nbsp;to a &quot;third party who may lawfully receive and possess them, such as their attorney, a local police agency, or a federal firearms dealer. In addition, such firearms and ammunition are subject to seizure and forfeiture,&quot; according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms&nbsp;and Explosives&nbsp;website.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe result of the Lautenberg Amendment &quot;is that people have been disarmed of weapons within the past 20 years and they&rsquo;ve been sent to prison when they&rsquo;ve been caught in possession,&quot; Waldron said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe consequences of one&rsquo;s actions are central to the issue, according to ATF&nbsp;spokesperson Ginger Colbrun. As an example, she said that if a gun owner is convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence, the person&rsquo;s actions are to blame for him no longer being allowed to possess a weapon -- not the law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It really is semantics when you look at it,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the person still&nbsp;has to give up the gun and to some, that&#39;s taking it away.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPascrell said there hasn&rsquo;t been any legislation in the past 20 years that took a gun from anyone in the United States. Gun advocates disagree, pointing to the federal crime bill and the Lautenberg Amendment as examples.&nbsp;But the facts are a gun can&#39;t be taken from someone who never had it, and&nbsp;having to surrender a&nbsp;gun&nbsp;because of a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction&nbsp;can be construed as&nbsp;it&nbsp;being taken away.&nbsp;We&nbsp;rate Pascrell&rsquo;s claim&nbsp;Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this story, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/01/politifact_new_jersey_pascrell.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Editor&#39;s Note: This story was initially published by accident with a Mostly True ruling.
