Stern asked Trump if he supported the looming invasion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump responded, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/in-2002-donald-trump-said-he-supported-invading-iraq-on-the#.njObkgzwJ\">Yeah, I guess so</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the debate, Trump said he made these comments to Stern &quot;very lightly.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump then noted another interview he did in January 2003, a few months before the invasion. Fox News&rsquo; Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn&#39;t be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know,&quot; Trump said. &quot;He&#39;s under a lot of pressure. I think he&#39;s doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Trump put the economy ahead of confronting Iraq, but he didn&rsquo;t speak against going to war. At most he suggested waiting for the United Nations to do something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A week after the United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003, Trump gave different takes. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that &quot;the war&rsquo;s a mess,&quot; according to the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/archive/lifestyle/2003/03/25/hollywood-partyers-soldiering-on/06327347-83d3-44c4-ab7b-dcd6fbda5437/?resType=accessibility\">Washington Post</a>. He told <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/30/arts/television/30RICH.html?pagewanted=all\">Fox News</a> that because of the war, &quot;The market&rsquo;s going to go up like a rocket.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout 2003, Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/25/timeline-of-trumps-comments-on-iraq-invasion-not-loud-not-strong-and-no-headlines/\">complained</a> about the cost of the Iraq War and its effect on the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest evidence of Trump&rsquo;s outright opposition to the war didn&rsquo;t come until an <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/interviews/a37230/donald-trump-esquire-cover-story-august-2004/\">August 2004 article in Esquire</a>, more than a year after the war started:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we&#39;re in. I would never have handled it that way,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has been challenged many times in this election to explain his early acceptance of the war. In a February 2016 interview on <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/02/21/trump_responds_to_howard_stern_interview_who_knows_what_was_in_my_head.html\">NBC&rsquo;s Meet the Press</a>, Trump said that he didn&rsquo;t know what he meant during his 2002 conversation with Stern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That was a long time ago, and who knows what was in my head.&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Sept. 26 debate, Trump also said <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/09/19/donald-trump-says-he-voiced-his-iraq-war-opposition-to-sean-hannity/?utm_term=.05defc73f826\">he had many debates</a> with Fox host and Trump supporter Sean Hannity prior to the Iraq invasion &mdash; in which Trump opposed the invasion, and Hannity supported it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, they didn&rsquo;t have these debates on the air so we have no record of them. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/778066460186931200\">Hannity has said this is &quot;100 percent true.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;I did not support the war in Iraq &hellip; The record shows that I&rsquo;m right.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The record does not support Trump&rsquo;s repeated assertions that he opposed the war prior to the 2003 invasion. Around the time of the invasion, Trump&rsquo;s comments were few and far between, not to mention vague.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2002, asked if America should go to war, he said, &quot;I guess so.&quot; Less than three months before the invasion, Trump said the president should be more focused on the economy, but he didn&rsquo;t specifically speak against launching an attack. He didn&rsquo;t voice full-throated opposition until almost a year and a half after the invasion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0df209e7-b481-4213-bfb7-55bb13ceb3a1\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0df209e7-b481-4213-bfb7-55bb13ceb3a1</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-26T22:27:03.901487", "ruling_date": "2016-09-26T23:26:27", "ruling_headline": "At first debate, Donald Trump claims, again, that he was against war in Iraq", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-claims-again-he-was-against-war-iraq", "ruling_link_text": "For the nth time...", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/07/donald-trump/trump-repeats-wrong-claim-he-opposed-iraq-war/ \">Trump repeats wrong claim that he opposed Iraq War</a>,&quot; Sept. 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/09/19/donald-trump-says-he-voiced-his-iraq-war-opposition-to-sean-hannity/?utm_term=.05defc73f826\">Donald Trump says he voiced his Iraq War opposition to Sean Hannity,</a>&quot; Sept. 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/25/timeline-of-trumps-comments-on-iraq-invasion-not-loud-not-strong-and-no-headlines/\">Timeline of Trump&rsquo;s comments on Iraq invasion: Not loud, not strong, and no headlines</a>,&quot; Feb. 25, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;I did not support the war in Iraq &hellip; The record shows that I&rsquo;m right.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a presidential debate", "statement_date": "2016-09-26", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 42, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/42/", "subject": "History", "subject_slug": "history", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 1, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/1/", "subject": "Iraq", "subject_slug": "iraq", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "At first debate, Trump claims, again, that he was against war in Iraq"}
