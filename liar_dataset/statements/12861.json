I know she&rsquo;s given me no support, zero support, and yet I&rsquo;m leading her in the polls.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do the numbers bear that out? We took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the Republican businessman is running for president, not against Ayotte for Senate. But we interpreted his comment as saying he is having a better showing in polls in New Hampshire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump didn&rsquo;t name any specific polls in his interview, and his campaign did not provide source material or respond to a request for comment. So we looked at their favorability ratings among the state&rsquo;s voters, and also examined how tight their races are in New Hampshire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We turned to RealClearPolitics.com, which tracks polling data and calculates an average of the most recent voter surveys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_trump_vs_clinton-5596.html\">New Hampshire presidential polling average</a> showed that on Aug. 2, when Trump made the comment, Democrat Hillary Clinton led the businessman in the state, 43.25 percent to 40.5 percent, a margin of nearly three percentage points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, the RealClearPolitics.com polling average for the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/senate/nh/new_hampshire_senate_ayotte_vs_hassan-3862.html\">state&rsquo;s U.S. Senate race</a> showed that Ayotte was virtually tied with Democrat Gov. Maggie Hassan, 45.8 to 45.2 percent, on the same day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those averages have since changed slightly. <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/politicker/2016/08/04/clinton-over-trump-new-hampshire-poll\">WBUR released a new poll</a> two days after Trump&rsquo;s interview that showed both Democrats widening their leads in New Hampshire. Clinton led Trump by 15 percentage points, the new survey showed, while Hassan led Ayotte by 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, not only is Trump not &quot;beating (Ayotte) in the polls by a lot,&quot; he&rsquo;s not beating her in the polls at all. Ayotte is doing better than Trump in New Hampshire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just to be extra careful, we also checked to see whether there was a period in which Trump was performing better against Clinton than Ayotte was against Hassan but couldn&rsquo;t find one in the RealClearPolitics.com archive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How about favorability ratings, which show how warmly voters feel towards a candidate, rather than whether they would or would not vote for them in an election matchup?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most recent WMUR Granite State Poll, released in late July, showed that Trump had a net favorability of negative 29 percent, while Ayotte scored a positive two percent net favorability rating. (Net favorability refers to the candidate&rsquo;s favorability score minus his or her unfavorability score.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, <a href=\"https://cola.unh.edu/survey-center/trump-and-clinton-tied-both-candidates-unpopular-new-hampshire-72116\">the survey found</a> 32 percent of New Hampshire voters had a favorable view of Trump, while 61 percent had an unfavorable opinion of the businessman. Six percent were neutral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And <a href=\"https://cola.unh.edu/survey-center/ayotte-and-hassan-remain-deadlocked-nh-senate-race-72016\">the poll showed</a> that 42 percent of state voters had a favorable opinion of Ayotte, 40 percent had an unfavorable view, seven percent were neutral and 11 percent didn&rsquo;t know enough to say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WBUR poll, released on August 4 after Trump&rsquo;s comment, showed similar patterns. Twenty-nine percent of New Hampshire voters had a favorable view of Trump, it found, while 60 percent had an unfavorable opinion, with 10 percent are undecided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/politicker/2016/08/04/clinton-over-trump-new-hampshire-poll\">The same poll </a>showed 42 percent of New Hampshire voters had a favorable view of Ayotte, compared to 38 percent who had an unfavorable opinion. Sixteen percent were undecided and three percent hadn&rsquo;t heard of her or refused to answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the two recent polls showed that Ayotte&rsquo;s favorability rating in the Granite State was far higher than Trump&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said he is beating Ayotte in the polls &quot;by a lot.&quot; However, Ayotte recent surveys have shown that New Hampshire voters view Ayotte more favorably than Trump. The polls also indicate that Ayotte is locked in a closer race against her Democratic challenger than Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Trump&rsquo;s claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cc62323e-c00c-4d16-92e8-219dc78509be\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cc62323e-c00c-4d16-92e8-219dc78509be</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-05T11:30:35.652144", "ruling_date": "2016-08-05T11:33:37", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim about doing better than Kelly Ayotte in N.H. polls", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-about-doing-better-", "ruling_link_text": "Ayotte has long done better than Trump in N.H. polls", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-transcript-the-republican-nominee-in-his-own-words/2016/08/02/77e9fa68-58eb-11e6-831d-0324760ca856_story.html\">Donald Trump transcript: The Republican nominee in his own words</a>, August 2, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Wayne Lesperance, Political Science professor at New England College, August 4, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real Clear Politics, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_trump_vs_clinton-5596.html\">New Hampshire: Trump vs. Clinton</a>, August 4, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real Clear Politics, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/senate/nh/new_hampshire_senate_ayotte_vs_hassan-3862.html\">New Hampshire Senate - Ayotte vs. Hassan</a>, August 4, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WBUR,<a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/politicker/2016/08/04/clinton-over-trump-new-hampshire-poll\"> WBUR Poll: After Conventions, Clinton Up 15 Points Over Trump In New Hampshire</a>, August 4, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of New Hampshire Survey Center, <a href=\"https://cola.unh.edu/survey-center/trump-and-clinton-tied-both-candidates-unpopular-new-hampshire-72116\">Trump and Clinton Tied; Both Candidates Unpopular In New Hampshire</a>, July 21, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of New Hampshire Survey Center, <a href=\"https://cola.unh.edu/survey-center/ayotte-and-hassan-remain-deadlocked-nh-senate-race-72016\">Ayotte and Hassan Remain Deadlocked in NH Senate Race, July 20</a>, 2016.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m beating (Kelly Ayotte) in the polls by a lot.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview with the Washington Post", "statement_date": "2016-08-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 194, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/194/", "subject": "Polls and Public Opinion", "subject_slug": "polls", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Kelly ", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "New Hampshire", "id": 1627, "last_name": "Ayotte", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "kelly-ayotte", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Ayotte_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1627/", "total_count": 11, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://ayotte.senate.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": "Trump's Pants on Fire claim on New Hampshire polling"}
