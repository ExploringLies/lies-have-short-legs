A reader recently sent us one based on an event that occurred on Michelle Obama&rsquo;s March 2014 trip to China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The email features a meme that&rsquo;s based on a photo of the first lady. It shows her energetically waving two red flags, one in each hand. A superimposed caption reads, &quot;Michelle Obama waves red communist flags on her taxpayer-funded visit to China. Anyone remember her ever waving an American flag?&quot; The meme includes a Web address for Tea Party Nation, a Facebook-style social media website for conservatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reader sent us the email wanting to know whether it is accurate, so we took a look. (Snopes.com beat us to the punch with a fact-check <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/photos/redflag.asp\"><u>here</u></a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Was Obama waving &quot;red communist flags&quot;?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, it was simply a bit of audience participation during a folk dancing exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It came as Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha were visiting an ancient wall in the former capital city of Xi&rsquo;an. The exhibit &quot;began with a breathtaking display of drumming and music by performers dressed in colorful traditional costumes,&quot; Michelle Obama <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/03/24/first-ladys-travel-journal-visiting-xian-city-wall\"><u>wrote in her trip diary</u></a>, which was <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/foreign-policy/first-lady-china-trip\"><u>later posted on the White House website</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later that day, the family and its entourage watched a second group of drummers and folk dancers. &quot;They did a lovely dance number for us (and my daughters and I joined in for some dancing at the end),&quot; Obama wrote. A White House press pool report said Michelle Obama and Malia were &quot;swaying to the music, mostly drums.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photographs -- posted at the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/03/24/first-ladys-travel-journal-visiting-xian-city-wall\"><u>White House website</u></a> and also in various media outlets, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/mar/24/michelle-obama-in-china-in-pictures\"><u>the </u><em><u>Guardian</u></em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/first-lady-joins-chinese-folk-dance-n60276\"><u>NBC News</u></a> -- confirm that the flags in question are not the Chinese flag. The national flag of China features five gold stars on a solid red field. Instead, Michelle Obama is clearly holding much longer banners that were used during one of the folk-dancing celebrations. The dancers are wearing and carrying a variety of colors other than red, including shades of purple, yellow and green.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&quot;Anyone remember her ever waving an American flag?&quot;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our online photo search pulled up at least one image of Michelle Obama waving a flag, taken while she was <a href=\"http://www.zimbio.com/photos/Michelle+Obama/United+States+First+Lady+Michelle+Obama+seen/wbD_TZIoIEb\">cheering on United States swimmers</a> at the 2012 London Olympics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also found ample evidence that Obama appears to enjoy displays of red-white-and-blue patriotism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, on the eve of the London Olympics, Obama attended a sendoff for Team USA by wearing &quot;a bright red peplum top and a white and red jacket that basically looked like a retro American flag,&quot; according to a Huffington Post <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/27/michelle-obama-olympics-outfit_n_1709331.html\"><u>account</u></a>. &quot;Standing against a navy backdrop, Michelle Obama would have made Betsy Ross proud.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, Mrs. O -- a now-defunct <a href=\"http://mrs-o.com/\"><u>blog</u></a> &quot;dedicated to chronicling the fashion and style of First Lady Michelle Obama&quot; -- <a href=\"http://mrs-o.com/newdata/2012/7/5/red-white-and-blue.html\"><u>noted</u></a> that when the Obamas celebrated July 4, 2012, on the South Lawn of the White House, Michelle Obama wore &quot;a red and blue striped shell paired with a pleated, side button white skirt. The president did his part on the fashion front, sporting a patriotic red, white and blue cowboy hat.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And during a 2011 trip to Botswana, Obama was <a href=\"http://theybf.com/2011/06/24/michelle-obama-greeted-by-chants-of-obama-ye-le-le-in-botswana\"><u>photographed</u></a> looking thrilled when she was welcomed by 25 schoolchildren waving American flags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chain email said Michelle Obama waved &quot;red communist flags&quot; on her trip to China. In reality, she didn&rsquo;t wave the national flag of China or any other &quot;communist&quot; flag -- she was simply waving long red banners during a folk-dancing exhibition.
