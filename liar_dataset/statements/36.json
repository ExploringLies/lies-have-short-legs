McCain's statement does not mention that part of her speech.\n</p>\n<p>\n On Aug. 22, Clinton's Senate office issued a statement saying she hasn't changed her position: \"The surge was designed to give the Iraqi government time to take steps to ensure a political solution to the situation.  It has failed to do so&hellip;.  It is abundantly clear that there is no military solution to the sectarian fighting in Iraq.  We need to stop refereeing the war, and start getting out now.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Indeed, Clinton introduced legislation in February in the Senate, S. 670, to withdraw troops from Iraq.\n</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
