He wants to see your internal affairs record. He believes there have been infractions in the past, committed by you. He wants to see your record. Why not release it to him?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s really that I can&#39;t,&quot; DeMaio replied. &quot;There are Attorney General guidelines in place that protect it because of what&#39;s in those records. It&#39;s any allegation ... what I can say is there&rsquo;s no sustained complaints on my record. I don&#39;t want to be the first cop in the state of New Jersey to set that precedent. It&rsquo;s just not an issue.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey learned there are guidelines covering different files kept on police officers, and there are strict protections on internal affairs files to maintain their confidentiality. But there are exceptions -- one of which would allow the release of DeMaio&rsquo;s internal affairs file.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s explain why DeMaio is being asked to release his records.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeMaio was appointed acting top cop in Newark days before the U.S. Justice Department announced an investigation into the Newark Police Department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey last year petitioned the federal government to investigate alleged civil-rights abuses by the department. When the previous police director, Garry McCarthy, announced his departure, ACLU-NJ Executive Director Deborah Jacobs asked Newark Mayor Cory Booker to require any internal candidate for the position &nbsp;to &quot;voluntarily disclose to the public their work assignment history and their internal affairs/disciplinary history.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter DeMaio&rsquo;s appointment was announced, Jacobs wrote in a May 10 opinion-editorial piece, &quot;For DeMaio, the need for transparency is especially pressing,&quot; citing a 2007 incident when DeMaio was reprimanded by the state Attorney General&rsquo;s Office for questioning a witness about his immigration status, as well as other concerns about DeMaio&rsquo;s reputation in the community.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Jacobs&rsquo; op-ed, she referred to the files she wants released as both internal affairs records and disciplinary records.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCity council members and a group of Newark pastors have also called for DeMaio to release his file, which they often refer to as his disciplinary record.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut a disciplinary record is generally not maintained as a separate file. The state Attorney General&rsquo;s Office recommends police departments keep a personnel file, an internal affairs file and a medical file on police officers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Booker spokeswoman told us the Newark Police Department follows that system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeMaio correctly stated that state Attorney General <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MjMtjqOwV4NCQLBlzXGT1beFPEm44voRmpshvJ62JHQ/new%20jersey%20attorny%20general%20internal%20affairs%20gidelines\">guidelines</a> protect internal affairs files. The guidelines state that &quot;the nature and source of internal allegations, the progress of internal affairs investigations, and the resulting materials are confidential information.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe guidelines describe several &quot;limited circumstances&quot; under which records from internal affairs investigations can be released, including upon a court order and upon the request of the county prosecutor or Attorney General.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the guidelines also state, &quot;the law enforcement executive officer may authorize access [to] a particular file or record for good cause.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state Attorney General&rsquo;s Office refused to confirm that the guidelines authorize Newark&rsquo;s police director to release an internal affairs file.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBooker&rsquo;s spokeswoman said the police director is the &quot;law enforcement executive officer&quot; in the city. She also noted, &quot;it should be pointed out that when they say a &lsquo;particular file&rsquo; they mean incident specific.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJames Drylie, executive director of Kean University&rsquo;s school of criminal justice, said that while DeMaio has the authority to release his internal affairs file as the &quot;law enforcement executive officer,&quot; the state Attorney General guidelines clearly aim to keep those files confidential.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe city administration sent this statement when we requested comment from DeMaio: &quot;Acting Police Director DeMaio remains focused on his number one priority - the public safety of our residents and making sure that this summer will be Newark&rsquo;s safest.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review. DeMaio said he can&rsquo;t release his internal affairs record because there are state Attorney General guidelines protecting it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state Attorney General&rsquo;s guidelines describe an internal affairs file as a confidential document, but also lays out specific exceptions to that policy -- one of which technically allows DeMaio to release his file.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate DeMaio&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/06/politifact_new_jersey_can_newa.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-06-27T13:28:23.910416", "ruling_date": "2011-06-30T05:15:00", "ruling_headline": "Acting Newark Police Director Samuel DeMaio says he can\u2019t release his internal affairs record ", "ruling_headline_slug": "acting-newark-police-director-samuel-demaio-says-h", "ruling_link_text": "He could if he wanted to", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tFox 5 Good Day New York,<a href=\"http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/booker-shoots-down-senate-run-rumor-good-day-new-york-20110609\">Interview with Newark Police Director Samuel DeMaio and Newark Mayor Cory Booker</a>, June 9, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Peter Aseltine, spokesman for New Jersey Attorney General&rsquo;s office, June 13 &amp;14, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Raymond Hayducka, second vice president of the <a href=\"http://www.njsacop.org/\">New Jersey State Association of Chiefs of Police </a>and South Brunswick police chief, June 13, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Attorney General, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MjMtjqOwV4NCQLBlzXGT1beFPEm44voRmpshvJ62JHQ/new%20jersey%20attorney%20general%20internal%20affairs\">Internal Affairs Policy &amp;
