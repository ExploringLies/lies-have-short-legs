Except we know that not all those teachers were fired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot; &#39;Firing&#39; is an incorrect term,&quot; said Steve Wollmer, director of communications for the New Jersey Education Association. Wollmer said Christie backed a budget cut of $1.3 billion for schools. It produced a mix of layoffs and retirements. Wollmer said layoffs were more common than retirements, but he said he has no hard data on how many people fell into each group. Plus, the cuts led to reductions in the ranks of both teachers and support staff. Wollmer lumps both groups together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m more than comfortable saying Christie was responsible for over 6,000 layoffs, due to his cuts,&quot; Wolmer said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that raises another wrinkle in the story. We need to assess whether responsibility for the loss of teachers rest solely on Christie&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gordon MacInnes, a former Democratic lawmaker and now head of a left-leaning think tank, New Jersey Policy Perspective, said two things happened after Christie took office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Christie and the Democratic Legislature cut $1 billion in state funds from school aid and the stimulus aid expired,&quot; MacInnes said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A multi-billion dollar state budget deficit made 2010 a very contentious year for school funding. Christie proposed deep reductions in aid, and local school boards tried to fill the gap with property tax hikes. Then <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/education/22schools.html\"><u>local voters shot down those plans in record numbers.</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those local decisions complicate the picture,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes, funding cuts do appear in many cases to have led to staffing reductions,&quot; said Bruce Baker, professor of education at Rutgers. &quot;But I&#39;m not sure of a good data source you could use to identify what share of those reductions were from &lsquo;reduction in force&rsquo; policies invoked by local public school districts claiming fiscal stress.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, as a deadline loomed for passage of a state budget, Christie refused concessions to the Democratic-controlled Legislature and the state&rsquo;s smallest budget in five years passed with a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/30/nyregion/30christie.html\"><u>minimum of Democratic support.</u></a> The initial cuts were so deep, a judge reversed a portion of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The loss of stimulus dollars also played a major role. According to the federal government website, <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/Transparency/RecoveryData/Pages/RecipientReportedDataMap.aspx?stateCode=DE&amp;PROJSTATUS=NPC&amp;AWARDTYPE=CGL\"><u>Recovery.gov,</u></a> New Jersey received over $1.6 billion in one-time education grants through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. In April 2010, Christie&rsquo;s administration said schools needed to manage a <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/education/news/2010/041310StateAid2011FAQl.pdf\"><u>slightly smaller loss of about $1 billion </u></a>in stimulus funds but in either case, schools were losing a significant amount of money due to the end of the federal program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, Christie gets a fair degree of responsibility for the school funding cuts, although the way those cuts translated into reductions in staff might be indirect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schultz said Christie firied 6,000 teachers. There are two problems with Schultz&rsquo;s claim. First, the number is closer to 4,500, and even the teachers&rsquo; union would not say that all the people that held those jobs were fired. Some of them retired and were not replaced. The number of teachers declined but not necessarily through being fired or laid-off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, while Christie pushed hard for steep cuts to school funding, he also got help from local voters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of those caveats, we rate Schultz&#39;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-07T10:33:21.856842", "ruling_date": "2013-11-07T12:39:44", "ruling_headline": "Ed Schultz says Chris Christie fired 6,000 teachers", "ruling_headline_slug": "schultz-says-gov-christie-pushed-fire-6000-teacher", "ruling_link_text": "Schultz gets a C in math", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>MSNBC, The Ed Schultz Show, Nov. 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Jersey Education Department,<a href=\"http://www.nj.gov/education/data/cs/\"> <u>Fall Survey - Certified Staff</u></a>, data 1999-2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Star Ledger,<a href=\"http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/11/a_chronology_of_gov_chris_christies_battles_with_teachers_and_their_union.html\"> <u>A chronology of Gov.
