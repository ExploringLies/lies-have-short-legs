Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and three GOP state senators were brought on by Walker&#39;s Act 10 -- a 2011 law that sharply curtailed collective bargaining powers for most public employees in Wisconsin. The measure drew massive protests in Madison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While on an April 27, 2015 trip to Massachusetts, Walker touched on those events during in <a href=\"https://howiecarrshow.com/scott-walker-the-left-never-stops/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>an interview</u></a> with <a href=\"https://howiecarrshow.com/stations/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Howie Carr</u></a>, a talk show host who is syndicated on more than 20 radio stations in New England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They caused damage to the Capitol,&quot; Walker said of the protesters, &quot;(and) the recall elections cost tens of millions of dollars to run -- the impact on the taxpayers.

The actual estimate was $347,500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what about the governor&#39;s claim that the recall elections cost tens of millions of dollars to run?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It suggests at least a couple of tens of millions -- or $20 million -- was spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the actual total falls short of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2012, there were <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/recalls-this-year-cost-taxpayers-more-than-14-million-3h6s664-169814556.html?ipad=y\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>news reports</u></a> on an <a href=\"http://www.gab.wi.gov/node/2569\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>announcement</u></a> by the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, which oversees state elections, that the recalls cost more than $14 million -- $6.3 million for the primaries plus $7.2 million for the recall elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest costs were poll workers salaries and staff wages. They were borne by local taxpayers, since municipalities administer elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the Government Accountability Board itself spent $663,000, primarily to process petitions signed by more than 931,000 people in order to get the governor&rsquo;s recall on the ballot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state board also had previously announced that a separate round of <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/127831843.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Senate recall elections</u></a>, in July and August of 2011, cost state and local taxpayers $2.1 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that&#39;s a total of nearly $16.3 million, which is sizable, particularly since it hadn&#39;t been budgeted.
