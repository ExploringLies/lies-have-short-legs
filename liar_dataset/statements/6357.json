And yet the group circulating the material, We Are Milwaukee, claims a Democratic Assembly member helped make it all possible.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDistribution of it comes ahead of the Aug. 14, 2012 <a href=\"http://m.jsonline.com/163368096.htm\">primary election</a> in which Coggs and four other Democrats are seeking the seat being vacated by Coggs&#39; cousin -- state Sen. Spencer Coggs, D-Milwaukee -- who was elected city treasurer in April 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo let&rsquo;s return to the wildly partisan times of 2011 and see what role Coggs played in advancing Walker&rsquo;s agenda.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&quot;Paid for&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/We-Are-Milwaukee/256296861084086\">We Are Milwaukee Inc.</a>, which says it works for social and economic justice, <a href=\"http://cfis.wi.gov/Public/Registration.aspx?page=RegistrantList\">registered</a> with the state Government Accountability Board as a political committee in March 2012. Its registrant was Peter Rickman, who has been active in public demonstrations <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/tonette-walker-gop-leaders-rally-governors-supporters-nt3t0av-137829313.html\">against Walker</a> and as part of the <a href=\"http://m.jsonline.com/131916813.htm\">Occupy Wall Street</a> movement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/images/WaM_Anti-Coggs1.jpg\">front</a> of the We Are Milwaukee brochure against Coggs (which lists a return address in Wauwatosa) says: &quot;We need leaders who will stand up to Scott Walker.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe attack on Coggs, on the <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/images/WaM_Anti-Coggs2.jpg\">back</a>, cites three 2011 votes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt says Coggs &quot;voted with&quot; Walker on one bill that the group says provides &quot;millions of dollars in tax breaks to big corporations and the super-rich.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt goes on to say Walker and his allies paid for for the tax breaks &quot;by busting unions, cutting BadgerCare, and raising taxes on the poor and the middle class, thanks to Elizabeth Coggs&rsquo; help.&quot; Cited are Walker&rsquo;s budget-repair bill and his 2011-2013 state budget bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRickman referred our questions to We Are Milwaukee spokesman Eric Hogensen, who argued that the tax breaks bill &quot;opened the door&quot; to cuts made in the budget-repair and budget bills because they created a &quot;deficit.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHmmm. The budget deficit Walker faced exceeded $3 billion. Just how pivotal was the single tax breaks bill that We Are Milwaukee cited?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s examine the three bills, all of which became law and are footnoted in the flyer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>1. Tax breaks</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs we reported in analyzing a July 2012 <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/13/kelda-helen-roys/roys-says-pocan-voted-walker-favor-tax-cuts-wealth/\">claim</a> made by state Rep. Kelda Helen Roys, D-Madison, against state Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, in a congressional race, <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/lcactmemo/jr1_ab3.pdf\">Assembly Bill 3&nbsp;</a> wipes away taxes for two years for businesses that move to Wisconsin. The state estimates the bill will mean $1 million over two years in lost revenue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCoggs voted for the bill, but so did many other Democrats. It was approved in the Assembly overwhelmingly, <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/votes/av0009.pdf\">82-12</a>, in January 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Coggs did vote &quot;with Walker&quot; for a bill that could, over a period of years, create tax breaks amounting to millions of dollars. But her vote was hardly as decisive as the group portrays it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>2. Budget-repair bill</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter a 61-hour debate in February 2011, the GOP-controlled Assembly adopted the budget-repair bill in a chaotic fashion. The bill gave Walker broad powers to reshape health programs, use borrowing and make employees pay more for benefits to fill a $137 million hole in the two-year state budget ending June 30, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/116824378.html?ipad=y\">reported</a>: &quot;Just after 1 a.m., Republicans cut off debate on Gov. Scott Walker&#39;s bill and in pell-mell fashion the body voted 51-17 to pass it. In the confusion, nearly one-third of the body -- 28 lawmakers including 25 Democrats, two Republicans and the body&#39;s lone independent -- did not vote on the bill at all.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCoggs was among those who did not vote, Assembly <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/votes/av0177.pdf\">records</a> show.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the lack of her vote wasn&#39;t an important factor, given the margin the bill was approved by. And the $137 million deficit far exceeded the estimated loss of $1 million in revenue over two years from the tax breaks bill Coggs did vote for.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYet We Are Milwaukee says the $1 million paved the way for the $137 million -- and more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>3. Budget bill</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for the two-year state budget, the Assembly passed it, 60-38, in June 2011. <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/votes/av0400.pdf\">Records</a> show Coggs voted no.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Walker-GOP budget cut spending on schools, local governments and public workers&#39; benefits to meet the two-year shortfall -- which was more than $3 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, it would have taken more than 3,000 tax breaks at $1 million each to &quot;pay for&quot; the cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe Are Milwaukee said &quot;millions of dollars in tax breaks&quot; were paid for &quot;by busting unions, cutting BadgerCare, and raising taxes on the poor and the middle class, thanks to Elizabeth Coggs&#39; help.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe idea that some $1 million in tax breaks over a two-year period supported by Coggs and most other Assembly Democrats needed to be paid for by some $3 billion in budget cuts is false and ridiculous.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-30T17:35:22.027050", "ruling_date": "2012-07-31T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Democratic Wisconsin lawmaker helped GOP Gov.
