Brown&rsquo;s death became a focus for both peaceful protests and rioting in Ferguson, and it attracted attention around the nation and the world. On Nov. 25, a grand jury decided not to indict, setting off a new wave of demonstrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The phrase &quot;every time he robs a store&quot; refers to surveillance footage showing Brown earlier that day robbing a store of cigarillos and assaulting a store employee. Supporters of Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot Brown, have said the robbery is an important piece of context in explaining Wilson&rsquo;s shooting of Brown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the PolitiFact reader asked us whether the photo was real or manufactured, so we decided to take a look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The version we received is cropped to focus on the African-American man holding the sign, with a partial view of a woman standing to his left. Other versions, such as one <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/photos/politics/fergusonsign.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>analyzed by Snopes.com</u></a>, include a fuller view of the woman, holding a sign that says, &quot;Shame on Ferguson Police,&quot; as well as another man, an African-American, holding a sign that says, &quot;We the People.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The starkly divergent messages of the three signs provide a clue that something is amiss. And indeed, something is amiss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the original photograph -- published on the <em>Riverfront Times</em>&rsquo; <a href=\"http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2014/10/jailhouse_tales_an_protester_who_was_arrested_sunday_night_tells_about_her_experience.php\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>news blog</u></a> on Oct. 1 -- the sign read, &quot;No mother should have to fear for her son&#39;s life every time he <em>leaves home&quot; </em>(emphasis added). It also includes the hashtags #blacklivesmatter and #stayhuman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But words on the sign were doctored by a <a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/BGIRJUh\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>user</u></a> of the social media site Imgur. Initially, the user posted this statement with the retouched photograph: &quot;The black community has every reason to be angry with the police, and the brutality they inflict. But making a martyr out of the kid that robbed a store and attacked a police officer is just mind boggling. Micheal (sic) Brown is one of the worst things to happen to race relations in a long time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At some point after the doctored version of the image began <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DelcoGal/status/539588849039843329\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>circulating</u></a>, the user acknowledged that he had changed the picture: &quot;Edit: Yes, I shopped this. It captured mine, and many others, frustration with this whole situation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A photograph that went viral purports to show a protester in Ferguson,&nbsp;holding a sign that said, &quot;No mother should have to fear for her son&#39;s life every time he robs a store.&quot; However, the photo was manipulated by a social media user, who later acknowledged the alteration. The change in wording turns the sign&rsquo;s message completely on its head, so we rate the claim Pants On Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-12-04T16:42:30.840538", "ruling_date": "2014-12-04T17:01:38", "ruling_headline": "Viral photo of Ferguson protester doesn't withstand close scrutiny", "ruling_headline_slug": "viral-photo-ferguson-protester-doesnt-withstand-cl", "ruling_link_text": "The words were Photoshopped", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Chain email provided by a PolitiFact reader</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Riverfront Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2014/10/jailhouse_tales_an_protester_who_was_arrested_sunday_night_tells_about_her_experience.php\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Arrested in Ferguson: What It&#39;s Like to Go to Jail While Protesters Negotiate Your Release</u></a>,&quot; Oct. 1, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imgur, user page for <a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/BGIRJUh\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bdawgid</u></a>, accessed Dec. 4, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/photos/politics/fergusonsign.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Doth Protest?</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 2, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Fake_news", "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "", "false_count": 44, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "", "id": 27, "last_name": "Chain email", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "chain-email", "pants_count": 106, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-emailer.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/27/", "total_count": 180, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says a man in Ferguson, Mo., was photographed holding a sign that said, &quot;No mother should have to fear for her son&#39;s life every time he robs a store.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a chain email", "statement_date": "2014-12-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 177, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/177/", "subject": "Criminal Justice", "subject_slug": "criminal-justice", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 130, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/130/", "subject": "Diversity", "subject_slug": "diversity", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
