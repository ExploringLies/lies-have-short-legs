Let&rsquo;s pop the hood.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, a bit of history.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOver several decades, it&rsquo;s become much tougher for citizens in Wisconsin to sue and win when claiming negligence by their local units of government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow much tougher?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a 2009 Wisconsin Supreme Court <a href=\"http://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;seqNo=37884\">opinion</a>, Justice David Prosser, a former Republican speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly, said that &quot;so far as government responsibility for torts is concerned, immunity has become the rule and liability has become the rare exception.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Justice,&quot; wrote Prosser, &quot;has been confined to a crawl space too narrow for most tort victims to fit.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGenerally speaking, except in cases involving unheeded warnings over dangers involving actions they absolutely should have taken, public agencies are shielded from liability. That&rsquo;s because of state laws and court rulings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA notable and longstanding exception to that -- under a state &quot;highway defects&quot; law dating to 1849, a year after statehood -- allows up to $50,000 in civil damages when highways and sidewalks are poorly maintained and lead to vehicle damage or bodily injury.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill up for debate would eliminate nearly all of that statute. Local governments have sought this for years, hoping to avoid what they see as the &quot;automatic&quot; liability for defects, and get more discretion over when and how to do highway repairs -- as state officials have. Former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle vetoed a previous attempt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s unique about the defective highways statute (893.83): Plaintiffs don&rsquo;t have to clear the high legal bar they would in winning a case against the government over other mistakes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey don&rsquo;t have to show government had an absolute duty to do the specific thing in dispute -- that duty is presumed under that existing law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNotably, the law creates a &quot;right to recover&quot; damages from government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMany of the cases are routinely settled before getting to court -- that&rsquo;s how strong the law is.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf the cases reach trial, jurors have to decide if damages stemmed from known road defects -- and whether the municipality kept the highway &quot;reasonably safe for public travel,&quot; according to jury instructions in place since 1974.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;With winter conditions, it&rsquo;s awfully difficult to make sure highways are maintained every second, every hour of every day,&quot; said Andrew Phillips, a lawyer representing the Wisconsin Counties Association. Counties do most of the highway work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&rsquo;s talking about potholes and defective shoulders, among other things -- problems that have been litigated all the way to the state&rsquo;s highest courts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe money stakes are not sky high, but significant: over a decade, counties served by Wisconsin County Mutual Insurance paid out $950,000 in these cases. That doesn&rsquo;t include all counties, or other municipalities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s turn back to the statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked about its claims, the Association for Justice pointed us to the text of the bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill would eliminate the liability provisions except for damages resulting from the accumulation of snow or ice that has existed on a highway for at least three weeks. The chief backers of the bill, the Wisconsin Counties Association, acknowledge that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo would that mean citizens could &quot;no longer sue&quot; and locals would not have a duty to repair, as the association claimed?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey couldn&rsquo;t sue under the highway defects statute -- but still could file a claim under a more general state law, according to Phillips, the lawyer for the counties group. Even Ann Jacobs, a personal injury lawyer speaking for the Association for Justice -- the group making the claim -- agreed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe two sides also agree localities&rsquo; legal exposure would drop if the more general state law (893.80) was the only route for plaintiffs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bottom line: People could still sue, though under less favorable circumstances from the complainant&rsquo;s viewpoint. The ultimate effect would be decided by judges.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about the second part of the claim? Would the bill eliminate the requirement that local governments repair roads?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJacobs, of the trial lawyers&rsquo; group, says it effectively does because enforcement of that duty would all but disappear without the specific liability statute.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What good is a right without a remedy?&quot; Jacobs asked.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven the counties&rsquo; attorney, Phillips, acknowledges that county decisions on when and how to repair highways would be more discretionary with the strict liability gone.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Association for Justice, at a public hearing on the bill, made that point using this language: &quot;Local governments would not have a general duty to maintain highways and bridges&quot; if the bill passed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in its public news release, the group&rsquo;s claim went well past that -- leaving readers to believe road repairs would no longer be required.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhillips pointed us to Chapter 83.025 of state statutes: &quot;The county trunk system shall be marked and maintained by the county.&quot; And for towns, 82.03: &quot;The town board shall have the care and supervision of all highways under the town&#39;s jurisdiction.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the locals still would have the obligation to repair.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s patch this up and move on.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA trial lawyers group contends that a bill would change a 162-year-old state law to &quot;make local governments&#39; repair of roads, bridges and sidewalks no longer required by state law.&quot; It continued: &quot;Injured citizens could no longer sue them for bodily or auto damages.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill could have a big impact on local government liability for highway problems, though just how dramatic remains to be seen.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the group&rsquo;s news release went too far in flatly claiming citizens could no longer sue, and asserting that highway repairs would no longer be required.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-03T13:25:55.329775", "ruling_date": "2011-11-04T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin Association for Justice says a state bill would end a requirement that local governments repair roads and prevent injured citizens from suing", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-association-justice-says-state-bill-woul", "ruling_link_text": "Bill favors local government, but claim is a bridge too far", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWisconsin Association for Justice, <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=251740\">press release</a>, Oct. 31, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with John Reinemann, lobbyist for Wisconsin Counties Association, Oct. 31, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Andrew Phillips, attorney representing Wisconsin Counties Association, Oct. 31, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Ann Jacobs, attorney, member of Wisconsin Association for Justice, Oct. 31, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Rep.
