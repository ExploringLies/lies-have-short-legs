What advice do you give  President Obama when it comes to whether or not he should offer a peace  plan?\"<br /><br />Clinton: \"Well, I never share advice that I give directly  to any president.\" <br /><br />Tapper: \"Well then, hypothetically?\" <br /><br />Clinton:  \"Well -- and I don't answer hypotheticals. But I will say this. That  this administration from the very first day has made it clear we are  committed to pursuing a path of peace in the Middle East. And to get the  two parties to get to a point where they can engage in negotiations  again to deal with these very difficult final status issues.\"<br /><br />We  zeroed in Clinton's claim that she doesn't answer \"hypotheticals.\"  Politicians often say that, but they'll answer them when it's in their  political interest. Such is the case with Clinton.&nbsp; <br /><br />Indeed, we  found several instances of Clinton batting away hypothetical questions,  just as she did with Tapper:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; In an interview with the  BBC last October, when asked about sanctions for Iran if it acquires a  nuclear weapon, <a href=\"http://london.usembassy.gov/euro035.html\" target=\"_blank\">she  said</a>, \"I don't want to get ahead of myself and I don't want to  answer a hypothetical. I think it's important that we stay together, we  keep moving together, and we stay committed to the same goal, which is  to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons pile.\"</p>\r\n<p>&bull; During a  CNN interview a few weeks later on the same topic, she <a href=\"http://amfix.blogs.cnn.com/2009/10/30/full-transcript-one-on-one-with-secretary-of-state-clinton/\" target=\"_blank\">answered</a>,  \"Well, I don't want to speculate or answer a hypothetical. I want this  process to play out.\"</p>\r\n<p>&bull; In June 2007, Wolf Blitzer <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0706/03/se.01.html\" target=\"_blank\">asked  Clinton</a> about using military force to stop genocide in the Darfur  region of Sudan. \"Well, but, we're not going to engage in these  hypotheticals,\" she said. \"I mean, one of the jobs of a president is  being very reasoned in approaching these issues, and I don't think it's  useful to be talking in these kind of abstract, hypothetical terms.\"</p>\r\n<p>&bull; She  protested hypotheticals again in a debate moderated by Tim Russert in  February 2008, when Russert asked, if \"al-Qaida resurges and Iraq goes  to hell, do you hold the right, in your mind as American president, to  re-invade, to go back into Iraq to stabilize it?\" <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23354734/ns/politics-the_debates/page/10/\" target=\"_blank\">Clinton  answered</a>, \"You know, Tim, you ask a lot of hypotheticals,\" before  answering broadly, \"You have to look at the entire situation to try to  figure out how we can stabilize Afghanistan and begin to put more in  there to try to get some kind of success out of it, and you have to work  with the Iraqi government so that they take responsibility for their  own future.\"</p>\r\n<p>But every so often, Clinton will answer  hypotheticals. We found a few examples in the presidential campaign  where her answer allowed her to distinguish herself from then-Sen.  Barack Obama, to emphasize her hard-line approach on foreign affairs.&nbsp;<strong><br /></strong><br />During  an April 2008 debate, she <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/us/politics/16text-debate.html?pagewanted=print\" target=\"_blank\">answered  a question</a> about what U.S. policy should be if Iran were to attack  Israel. \"Of course I would make it clear to the Iranians that an attack  on Israel would incur massive retaliation from the United States, but I  would do the same with other countries in the region,\" she said. A week  later, in <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24247198/\" target=\"_blank\">an interview  with Keith Olbermann</a>, she was asked what would constitute \"massive  retaliation.\" She didn't specifically answer his question, she didn't  protest that it was hypothetical, either. <br /><br />Perhaps the most  significant example we found was when Brian Williams asked candidates a  stark hypothetical about terrorist attacks on the American homeland. He  started with Obama.<br /><br />\"Senator Obama, if, God forbid a thousand  times, while we were gathered here tonight, we learned that two American  cities had been hit simultaneously by terrorists, and we further  learned beyond the shadow of a doubt it had been the work of al-Qaida,  how would you change the U.S. military stance overseas as a result?\"  Williams asked.<br /><br />Obama talked about managing an effective  emergency response and making sure the United States had high-quality  intelligence on who had attacked. <br /><br />Clinton <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/27/us/politics/27debate_transcript.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\" target=\"_blank\">didn't  quibble</a> about the hypothetical in this case and emphasized she  would make a strong and swift response.<br /><br />\"Well, again, having been  a senator during 9/11, I understand very well the extraordinary horror  of that kind of an attack and the impact that it has far beyond those  who are directly affected,\" she said. \"I think a president must move as  swiftly as is prudent to retaliate. If we are attacked and we can  determine who was behind that attack, and if there were nations that  supported or gave material aid to those who attacked us, I believe we  should quickly respond. Now, that doesn't mean we go looking for other  fights. You know, I supported President Bush when he went after al-Qaida  and the Taliban in Afghanistan. And then when he decided to divert  attention to Iraq, it was not a decision that I would have made had I  been president, because we still haven't found bin Laden. So let's focus  on those who have attacked us and do everything we can to destroy  them.\"<br /><br />The next day, the Clinton campaign even promoted her  response to the hypothetical, saying Clinton \"was the candidate who  demonstrated that she would know how to respond if the country was  attacked.\" <br /><br />So Clinton has a mixed record on hypothetical  questions. She's dodged many, as she did with Tapper, but she's also  answered a fair number -- particularly when it suited her political  goals. So we rate her statement Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-04-13T14:22:15.041528", "ruling_date": "2010-04-13T15:03:48", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton doesn't answer hypothetical questions?
