The issue then was a claim by Atlanta&rsquo;s chief operating officer about how much upfront public money is typically invested in these types of projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe debate continues. This time we examine a claim made by Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed about construction costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReed, a staunch supporter of a new stadium, has said that renovating the 21-year-old Georgia Dome, where the Falcons currently play, is a bad idea. Reed said the renovation would cost more than the upfront public funding portion of a new stadium.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReed says the Dome would need up to <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/repair-costs-aging-dome-disputed/nWNLk/\">$350 million</a> in work over the next five to seven years, based on information from the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, the Dome&rsquo;s owner.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitifact Georgia decided to investigate &nbsp;the estimates for a renovated Georgia Dome. We wanted to know how those renovations compare with construction of a new stadium.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the deal that was reached <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/news/falcons-reed-agree-on-key-stadium-terms/nWkLb/\">this week</a>, the Falcons would contribute $800 million toward the proposed $1 billion stadium. Team owner Arthur Blank sits on the board of directors of Cox Enterprises, which owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe publicly funded portion of the new retractable-roof stadium would be $200 million in bonds issued by the city and backed by hotel-motel tax revenue. The Falcons would assume responsibility for $50 million in infrastructure costs. The Blank Family Foundation would invest $15 million in projects for neighborhoods around the stadium; the city&rsquo;s economic development agency would commit another $15 million. The deal also calls for at least 31 percent minority and women business participation in the design and construction work. The Atlanta City Council would have to approve a funding deal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Falcons want a new stadium in time for the 2017 football season, when their lease expires at the Georgia Dome.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia asked Reed&rsquo;s office about his source for the renovation figures. It pointed us to a 2010 master plan <a href=\"http://www.gwcc.com/about/stadium/Reports/Master%20Plans/mpreport2.pdf\">study</a> of the Dome commissioned by the GWCCA. That study examined what a new NFL stadium program would look like and the costs for getting the Dome to that level.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat study included the following expanded/renovated Dome budget:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew additional area: &nbsp;&nbsp; $118,100,000 (369,000 square feet)<br />\r\n\tMajor renovation: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $145,600,000<br />\r\n\tMinor renovation: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ 23,200,000<br />\r\n\tSeating Bowl/Field: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ 25,000,000<br />\r\n\tReplace Roof Fabric: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ 30,000,000<br />\r\n\tSoft Costs, fees, etc (15%):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ 51,300,000<br />\r\n\tTotal: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $393,200,000<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe total does not include year-to-year cost increases, parking lots and garages, or land. It also does not include an optional $200 million retractable roof.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe commissioned studies were completed by Kansas City, Mo.-based Populous, one of the largest stadium builders in the nation. The company is now a finalist in the GWCCA&rsquo;s selection process for a lead architect. Populous was not asked to itemize specific work under the &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; renovation categories, said a spokeswoman representing the GWCCA.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith updated features and arrangements, the study allows for a seating capacity of 65,000 seats with the possibility for expansion to 75,000 seats.The Georgia Dome currently has 71,250 seats<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother GWCCA-commissioned report, released in <a href=\"http://www.gwcc.com/about/stadium/Reports/Master%20Plans/mpreport3.pdf\">February 2011</a>, focused on a new open-air stadium, but it also examined continued maintenance and improvements at the Georgia Dome over the next 20 years. That study found that from 2011 to 2020, $44.5 million in maintenance work would be needed to retain the Dome at &quot;today&rsquo;s level of quality. An additional $35 million to $70 million in capital improvements -- such as a new roof, plumbing and technology upgrades and food service equipment -- would also be needed during the same time period to keep the Dome a competitive venue over the next decade, the report said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOver the past 16 years, combined maintenance projects and improvement projects at the Dome have equaled $71,430,000, according to the report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInitially, the 2010 budget document sent to us from the mayor&rsquo;s office and included in the 2010 report listed an incorrect figure for a cost sub total. Politifact Georgia caught the error while doing our own math on the numbers, and Populous revised the document.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDepending on your assumptions, it&rsquo;s easy to inflate the costs of an old facility, said Neil deMause, an author and blogger who monitors -- and has been critical of -- sports facility deals across the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Are your stated costs just to maintain (the facility), doing some upgrades or completely gutting it and making it look like a new facility?&quot; he said. &quot;The Falcons are playing in the Dome now, and it doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s falling down. Could you spend less than $100 million and upgrade it? I don&rsquo;t know, nobody has asked that question.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe argument for stadium upgrades across the nation has been met with mixed results lately.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs part of a stadium extension deal approved late last year, the <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2013/02/21/stae-agency-makes-first-approval-on.html?ana=e_du_pub&amp;s=article_du&amp;ed=2013-02-21&amp;u=pjSoOiNiFDG8NSOXYH2FUQ02fd2277\">Buffalo Bills </a>will receive $94 million in public funds as part of a $130 million renovation. This week, North Carolina&rsquo;s governor <a href=\"http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/03/05/3893286/mccrory-no-state-money-for-panthers.html\">denied</a> the use of public money for renovation of the Carolina Panthers&rsquo; Bank of America Stadium. The team had asked for $62.5 million as part of a $250 million renovation deal. Also this week, senators in <a href=\"http://www2.tbo.com/news/politics/2013/mar/06/miami-dolphins-stadium-bill-will-require-voter-app-ar-651235/\">Miami</a> are proposing a referendum be approved before hotel-motel taxes are used to fund renovations at the Dolphins&rsquo; stadium. And although arbitrators sided last month with the St. Louis Rams for $700 million in renovations at the Edward Jones Dome, some officials think the money would be better spent on a new facility.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRodney Fort, co-director of the University of Michigan&rsquo;s Center for Sports Management said the idea a stadium renovation would be more expensive than building a new facility is difficult to contemplate. But if you cannot get the same flow of value no matter how you renovate, then you&rsquo;re comparing apples to oranges, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUltimately, we return to the original question: To build new or to renovate?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe mayor says the (Georgia) Dome would need up to $350 million in work over the next five to seven years. That amount is more than the cost of the upfront public money ($200 million) that could be needed for a proposed $1 billion Falcons stadium.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReed cites figures from a 2010 study that puts the Dome&rsquo;s renovation costs at about $393 million. Those renovations would include 369,000 square feet of additional space, a roof replacement and upgrades to the seating bowl/field area. Using these figures, the renovations would be more than the $200 million public investment in the proposed deal for a new stadium.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA study the following year, completed by the same company, lists maintenance and capital costs to keep the Dome at &quot;today&rsquo;s&quot; levels between $79.5 million and $114.5 million. Those costs would include basic renovation items such as technology and plumbing upgrades, along with a new roof. Using these figures, the renovation cost would be less than the $200 million public investment into the proposed new stadium deal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe difference lies with which style of renovations is chosen: the exclusive Rolls-Royce level of renovations or the cheaper, base model Honda level of renovations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReed&rsquo;s statement is partially accurate but needs a lot of additional information and context.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rated the statement Half True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStaff writer Karishma Mehrotra contributed to this story.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-07T23:11:19.633731", "ruling_date": "2013-03-08T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Would new stadium be cheaper than a Dome rehab?
