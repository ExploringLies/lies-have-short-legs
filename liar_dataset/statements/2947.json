Some of our people make half or a third as much as they could make if they worked in the private sector.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKennedy is president of the Wisconsin chapter of the American Federation of Teachers, known as AFT-Wisconsin. Despite its name, <a href=\"http://www.aft-wisconsin.org/?zone=/unionactive/view_article.cfm&amp;HomeID=83504&amp;page=About20AFT2DW\">the union </a><a href=\"http://www.aft-wisconsin.org/?zone=/unionactive/view_article.cfm&amp;HomeID=83504&amp;page=About20AFT2DW\">represents</a> only a fraction of Wisconsin&rsquo;s school teachers. Its 17,000 members include university and technical college faculty as well as a variety of other white-collar workers, including professionals such as nurses and lawyers, in state and local government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKennedy&rsquo;s 8 percent number is awful specific. So we decided to take a look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked the basis for his statement, he provided two reports released in 2010 by two Washington, D.C., organizations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth studies compared state and private-sector employees taking into account differences in education, years of experience and other factors. That&rsquo;s important because, on the whole, the average government worker has more education and earns a higher salary than a private-sector worker.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first <a href=\"http://epi.3cdn.net/8808ae41b085032c0b_8um6bh5ty.pdf\">report</a>, by the <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/\">Economic Policy Institute</a>, found that state workers across the country are paid 11 percent less than private-sector workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe difference is 7.6 percent less, the report said, if pay plus benefits are considered.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKennedy described the 7.6 percent figure to PolitiFact Wisconsin as a &quot;pay differential.&quot; He said he simply rounded it up to 8 percent in the Gousha interview.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo problems here:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tKennedy&rsquo;s statement referred to pay, but he cited a number that covers pay and benefits.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tKennedy actually would have been better off citing the 11 percent figure, which referred to pay only -- except that figure is a national one and the study did not provide any statistics for Wisconsin.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe second <a href=\"http://www.slge.org/vertical/Sites/%7BA260E1DF-5AEE-459D-84C4-876EFE1E4032%7D/uploads/%7B03E820E8-F0F9-472F-98E2-F0AE1166D116%7D.PDF\">report</a> -- done by two University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professors for the National Institute of Retirement Security, whose board is largely composed of representatives of public employee pensions -- also was national in scope. But it did provide one Wisconsin statistic: From 2000 to 2008, the wages of state employees was 6.2 percent less than for private-sector employees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo more problems there:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe 6.2 percent differential is less than the 8 percent cited by Kennedy -- off by nearly one-fourth.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tAnd the figure is an average for 2000-2008, while Kennedy&rsquo;s statement referred to current compensation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBeyond that, in his statement, Kennedy cited state employee pay. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut when comparing state and private-sector workers, it is crucial to assess not only pay but benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHistorically, said UWM economics professor <a href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu/letsci/economics/faculty/heywood.cfm\">John Heywood</a>, co-author of the second study cited by Kennedy, public employee unions have accepted lower pay in exchange for more generous benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational studies, he said, have confirmed that state workers earn less but get higher benefits than private-sector employees -- although the overall difference is hard to calculate partly because benefits are complicated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, many union leaders -- when defending higher benefits for public employees -- often point to the trade-off Heywood references: Higher benefits, but lower pay.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, it&rsquo;s ironic to now have the argument that low pay is the problem, without an acknowledgment of the higher benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen it comes to benefits, pensions are often cited as more generous for government employees. In Wisconsin, that disparity was highlighted in a February 2010 <a href=\"http://www.wpri.org/Reports/Volume23/Vol23No2/Vol23No2.html\">study</a> by the <a href=\"http://www.wpri.org/\">Wisconsin Policy Research Institute</a>, a conservative think tank.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe study, done by an actuarial firm, calculated that a state employee in Wisconsin who earns $48,000 a year would retire with an estimated monthly pension benefit of $1,712. That is $411 more than a private-sector employee who earned $70,000 a year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are other sorts of benefits, of course, including health care and vacation time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what to make of Kennedy&rsquo;s statement?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said Wisconsin state employees are &quot;averaging about 8 percent less&quot; in pay than if they worked in the private sector. But the figure he relied on was from a national study that combined pay and benefits. A second study focused on state workers and pay, but it didn&rsquo;t come out to 8 percent. What&rsquo;s more, Kennedy&rsquo;s statement skips a key point -- one union leaders have made over the years -- that pay is lower because benefits are higher.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn sum, Kennedy did not provide evidence that supports his claim, which itself provides only a partial look at the debate. If any more evidence emerges, we&rsquo;ll review it. In the meantime, we rate Kennedy&rsquo;s claim False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-12-10T16:27:02.133487", "ruling_date": "2010-12-12T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Union leader says Wisconsin state employees earn about 8 percent less than if they were in private sector", "ruling_headline_slug": "union-leader-says-wisconsin-state-employees-earn-a", "ruling_link_text": "Number cited is national, not state, and what about those benefits costs?
