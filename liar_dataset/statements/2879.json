For $1,000?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were, ahem, bowled over. Does a commode really cost that much? We researched the ordinance and called plumbers to find out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA 2008 DeKalb ordinance requires that newly purchased buildings have low-flow toilets and other water-saving fixtures installed before the county turns on water service. The ordinance applies to residential and commercial properties built before Jan. 1, 1993, in the county&#39;s unincorporated areas.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Department of Watershed Management performs free inspections to certify a building is compliant.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBuildings that will be torn down, foreclosed, or transferred between spouses or from a parent to a child are exempt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf the switch costs more than $1,000 per toilet for a residential property, you can get a financial hardship waiver.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeKalb County offers a rebate program to defray the cost. Water customers can purchase from a list of eligible toilets and receive up to $100. After a quick search, AJC PolitiFact Georgia found a $160 toilet on the online list.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Boyer spokeswoman emphasized the toilet ordinance was not the main focus of the commissioner&#39;s article. Her target was DeKalb&#39;s recently instituted foreclosure registry, which requires banks and other owners of foreclosed homes to register them online. She tried to tank the proposal, but it passed in July.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe spokeswoman also referred us to Robert Broome, a lobbyist with the Atlanta Board of Realtors. Broome told us that the group supports water conservation but opposes DeKalb&#39;s rule because it ties the installation of those fixtures to real estate transactions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe change can be expensive, Broome said. He&#39;s been told of cases where homeowners have had to rip up dry wall or old plumbing to comply.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBroadly speaking, toilets can cost just about anything. Consider the porcelain throne of rock royalty John Lennon. It sold in an August auction for about $15,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLee Krinsky, general manager of Plumb Works Inc. in Atlanta, recalled a toilet that cost $13,000, excluding the $1,000 seat. It was hand-painted with a floral design. The seat, which was inlaid with gold, was fashioned in the shape of a seashell.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA more typical low-flow toilet can range from $500 to $800, Krinsky said. This includes the cost of purchasing the toilet, picking it up from the supplier, installing it, and hauling the old one away.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf installation goes smoothly, and most do, a plumber can be in and out of the bathroom in an hour-and-a-half, Krinsky said. Given the high cost of water, the toilet will easily pay for itself.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor another opinion, we talked to Ellen Whitaker, executive director of the Plumbing and Mechanical Association of Georgia. The trade organization once opposed low-flow ordinances but switched positions after the drought.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlumbers in Whitaker&#39;s group were reluctant to give a price range for the job. Variables such as the condition of the old toilet and plumbing can make it hard to predict, she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tConsider the toilet flange, Whitaker said. The ring connects the toilet to a drain pipe and stops smells from seeping up through the commode. If the flange is stuck in place, a plumber might spend extra hours removing it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis means $1,000 &quot;can be a good price,&quot; Whitaker said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf course, you could install the toilet yourself. If you purchased that $160 toilet we found online, hauled it home yourself, got the $100 rebate, and encountered no unusual problems, your grand total would be $60, plus tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA low-flow toilet can cost as little as dinner and a movie or as much as a Toyota Corolla.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe cost of professional installation varies, but can often fall in the $500 to $800 range. Do-it-yourselfers can spend less than $100, thanks to DeKalb&#39;s rebate program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf the job costs more than $1,000, you can get a waiver.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVery strictly speaking, Boyer&#39;s right. Installing a low-flow toilet &quot;can&quot; cost up to $1,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in many cases, it will cost much less.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoyer&#39;s claim could have used more explanation and context, but much of it holds water. We therefore rule it Half True.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-11-30T15:36:56.226760", "ruling_date": "2010-12-01T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "DeKalb commissioner says low-flow toilets can be costly", "ruling_headline_slug": "dekalb-commissioner-says-low-flow-toilets-can-be-c", "ruling_link_text": "Some of the claim holds water.
