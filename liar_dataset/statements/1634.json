Minutes into the 40-minute \"Florida Senate Showdown,\" Rubio made a case  that he'll stand up to President Barack Obama's agenda and Crist won't.<br /><br />\"Everyone  knows that you won't stand up to the Obama agenda because just a year  ago you were campaigning for it,\" the former House speaker said,  referring to Feb. 10, 2009, when Crist embraced the president at a Fort  Myers campaign event for the federal stimulus package.<br /><br />We've  fact-checked several claims about Crist's support for the stimulus.  Indeed, he earned a Pants on Fire rating for saying <a href=\"http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2009/nov/05/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-he-didnt-endorse-stimulus-bill/\" target=\"_blank\">he  didn't endorse it</a>. <br /><br />So it was a Rubio comment later in the  program that drew our attention. <em>FOX News Sunday</em> host Chris Wallace  asked Rubio, \"Why is $8 billion and 87,000 jobs bad for a state that has  12 percent unemployment?\"<br /><br />\"Well ... if it's bad for America, it  can't possibly be good for your state,\" Rubio said. \"Let me tell you why  the stimulus has failed. The stimulus has failed because since that  famous day in February where the governor campaigned with Barack Obama  on behalf of the stimulus program, 211,000 Floridians have lost their  jobs.\"<br /><br />211,000 is a big number, so we wanted to check Rubio's  facts.<br /><br />Conveniently, the state's <a href=\"http://www.floridajobs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Agency for Workforce Innovation</a> released a <a href=\"http://www.floridajobs.org/publications/news_rel/LMS%20Release%2003-26-10.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> on state employment figures just two days before the debate. In it,  Florida's record 12.2 percent unemployment rate is announced, along with  many statistics on the state's jobs picture, including year-over-year  numbers from February 2009, the month Crist campaigned with Obama. <br /><br />The  report shows Florida had 8,356,000 jobs in February 2009 and 8,125,000  in February 2010, the difference being 231,000. These are the  seasonally adjusted numbers for the civilian population.<br /><br />However,  if you look at seasonally adjusted nonagricultural employment --- a  less-inclusive number --- you see the basis for Rubio's claim. There the  job loss in a year's time is 211,500.<br /><br />It's the latter number  that the Rubio campaign points to. Spokesman Alberto Martinez also  shared a report from House Way and Means Republicans that seeks to  highlight the stimulus as a job-killer, rather than a job creator, where  Florida is said to have lost 240,400 jobs since the stimulus passed.<br /><br />Like  any statistics, these are easily sliced and diced to make the key  point. But Rubio is very close to the precise number, and in fact, he  underestimates it slightly when his point is that Florida has lost a lot  of jobs. So we rule this one True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-28T15:16:30.251528", "ruling_date": "2010-03-28T17:17:14", "ruling_headline": "Rubio says Florida has lost 211,000 jobs since Crist campaigned for the stimulus", "ruling_headline_slug": "rubio-says-florida-has-lost-211000-jobs-crist-camp", "ruling_link_text": "Very close on target", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Congressional Quarterly, transcript of the Crist-Rubio debate, March 28,  2010<br /><br />Agency for Workforce Innovation, <a href=\"http://www.floridajobs.org/publications/news_rel/LMS%20Release%2003-26-10.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Florida&rsquo;s  February Employment Figures Released,</a> March 26, 2010<br /><br />PolitiFact  Florida, <a href=\"http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2009/nov/05/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-he-didnt-endorse-stimulus-bill/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Charlie  Crist says he didn't endorse stimulus bill,\"</a> Nov. 5, 2009. accessed  March 28, 2010<br /><br />St. Petersburg Times, <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/workinglife/florida-unemployment-reaches-122-percent-setting-a-modern-era-record/1082988\" target=\"_blank\">\"Florida  unemployment reaches 12.2 percent, setting a modern era record,\"</a> March 27, 2010<br /><br />U.S. House Ways and Means Republicans, <a href=\"http://republicans.waysandmeans.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=175861\" target=\"_blank\">48  out of 50 States Have Lost Jobs Since Democrats' Stimulus Passed,</a> March 10, 2010<br /><br />Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/laus.nr0.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Regional and State  Employment and Unemployment Survey,</a> March 26, 2010<br /><br />E-mail  with Alberto Martinez, Marco Rubio campaign spokesman, March 28, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 36, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 26, "first_name": "Marco", "half_true_count": 33, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 277, "last_name": "Rubio", "mostly_true_count": 37, "name_slug": "marco-rubio", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Marco_Rubio.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/277/", "total_count": 168, "true_count": 20, "website": "http://www.rubio.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\"Since that famous day in February where the governor campaigned with  Barack Obama on behalf of the stimulus program, 211,000 Floridians have  lost their jobs.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a U.S. Senate primary debate on FOX News Sunday", "statement_date": "2010-03-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 150, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/150/", "subject": "Stimulus", "subject_slug": "stimulus", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 15, "current_job": "", "false_count": 9, "first_name": "Charlie", "half_true_count": 20, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 257, "last_name": "Crist", "mostly_true_count": 19, "name_slug": "charlie-crist", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/crist.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/257/", "total_count": 90, "true_count": 15, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": null}
