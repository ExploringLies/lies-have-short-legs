It begins, &quot;The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, the 17th Amendment was seen as a move away from corruption and toward purer democracy, according to an Oct. 10, 2013, <em>Austin American-Statesman</em><a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/weblogs/first-reading/2013/oct/10/tea-party-principles-dewhurst-and-patrick-want-do-/\"> <u>news blog post</u></a> and an Oct. 16, 2013<em> Statesman</em><a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/let-legislature-not-voters-pick-us-senators/nbQFq/\"> <u>news story</u></a>.
