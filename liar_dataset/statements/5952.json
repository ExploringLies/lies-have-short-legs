But one of the flashpoints in the 2011 fight over public employee unions in Wisconsin was a boycott of businesses that supported Gov. Scott Walker.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe effort was launched in the days before and after Walker signed a bill that sharply curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat was back in March 2011. But in a Milwaukee TV <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/politics/upfront/Lt-Gov-candidates-debate-issues/-/10057538/13362900/-/b7h4kw/-/index.html\">interview</a> broadcast May 13, 2012, less than a month before Wisconsin&rsquo;s historic recall elections, GOP Lt. Gov. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rebecca-kleefisch/\">Rebecca Kleefisch</a> reignited the boycott issue in the context of one of the recall&rsquo;s top issues: jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSitting alongside <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/mahlon-mitchell/\">Mahlon Mitchell</a>, her Democratic challenger, Kleefisch spoke on WISN (Channel 12) about the importance of creating jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen she turned to Mitchell, who is president of the <a href=\"http://pffw.org/\">Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin</a> union, and this exchange ensued:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Kleefisch</strong>: &quot;Sir, when you send out a letter encouraging folks to boycott more than 100 companies as the head of the firefighters union, I don&#39;t know how that helps job creation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Mitchell</strong>: &quot;That&rsquo;s just not true, that&rsquo;s just not true. I didn&rsquo;t send out a letter to boycott a hundred companies. You show me that letter because that&rsquo;s not true.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Kleefisch</strong>: &quot;Sure.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;d like to see the letter, too, as we examine what role Mitchell, a political newcomer, played in the boycotts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, it was Mitchell&rsquo;s role as a sharp Walker critic -- and the fact he opposed Walker&rsquo;s collective bargaining changes even though his union was exempt from them -- that first gave him political prominence.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo back Kleefisch&rsquo;s statement, Kleefisch campaign manager Rachel Pecor provided a <a href=\"http://radioviceonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/union-wisconsin-letter.pdf\">letter</a> that was dated March 10, 2011 and signed by Mitchell and six other public employee union leaders.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe letter was sent to Tom Ellis, president of what was then the Milwaukee-based <a href=\"https://www.mibank.com/files/mibank/resources/lp/MI_Corp_Splash.html\">M&amp;I Bank</a>. M&amp;I has since been acquired by BMO Financial Group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe letter noted that Ellis was a <a href=\"http://www.wisdc.org/index.php?module=wisdc.websiteforms&amp;cmd=searchadvanced&amp;filter=+Search+&amp;contributor_name=Ellis%2C+Thomas\">campaign contributor</a> to Walker. It demanded that M&amp;I Bank publicly oppose Walker&rsquo;s reform law, which limited most state and local government employees to collectively bargain over wages only.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf M&amp;I didn&rsquo;t comply, the letter said, the letter signers would &quot;publicly and formally boycott the goods and services provided by your company.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tM&amp;I clearly is a single business, although it had well over <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/124989399.html?ipad=y\">100 branches</a> in Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPecor also provided a March 2011 <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/117798733.html#%21page=31&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst\">article</a> reporting that Mitchell and the other signers of the M&amp;I letter made the same demand a day later in a letter to the <a href=\"http://www.kwiktrip.com/Home/Default.aspx\">Kwik Trip</a> convenience store chain.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKwik Trip is a family owned company with <a href=\"http://www.kwiktrip.com/whereweare/StoreLocator.aspx\">more than 100 stores</a> in Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, it&rsquo;s clear that Mitchell signed not one but two boycott letters. Kleefisch claimed they urged boycotts of more than 100 &quot;companies,&quot; which isn&rsquo;t technically correct, although the two targeted companies each had more than 100 business locations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPecor also provided a <em>Journal Sentinel</em> <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/118214239.html\">article</a> from later in March 2011 indicating that, according to the state chamber of commerce, the boycott had targeted additional businesses; and another <em>Journal Sentinel</em> <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/118963234.html\">article</a> reporting that a state employees union was circulating letters to businesses threatening a boycott.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPecor acknowledged there wasn&rsquo;t proof that Mitchell had signed any other letters urging boycotts beyond M&amp;I and Kwik Trip. But she argued that the larger boycotts were &quot;encouraged&quot; by the Mitchell letters. She also cited a <a href=\"http://scottwalkerwatch.com/boycott-center/\">list of more than 100 businesses</a> that, according to the pro-recall Scott Walker Watch group, were targeted for boycotts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMitchell campaign spokesman Kevin Benish said Mitchell signed only the two boycott letters because M&amp;I and Kwik Trip had received government aid but mistreated employees. Benish tried to downplay the letters, saying they didn&rsquo;t actually threaten boycotts, though they clearly did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBenish said Mitchell didn&rsquo;t endorse and couldn&rsquo;t control any boycotts efforts undertaken beyond M&amp;I and Kwik Trip. Asked whether Mitchell opposed any of the other boycott efforts, Benish didn&rsquo;t provide any evidence that Mitchell had.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKleefisch said Mitchell sent a letter &quot;encouraging folks to boycott more than 100 companies.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMitchell signed boycott letters to two businesses, each of which had more than 100 locations. Eventually, the boycotts targeted more than 100 individual businesses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat was the thrust of Kleefisch&rsquo;s statement, although she overreached by saying Mitchell sent a letter specifically encouraging a boycott of more than 100 companies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn short, her statement is partially accurate but left out important details -- our definition of Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-18T17:21:11.506716", "ruling_date": "2012-05-20T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "In Wisconsin recall, Lt.
