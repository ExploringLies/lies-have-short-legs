For this fact check, we&rsquo;ll look at the claim that Renacci &quot;opposed increasing combat bonuses for our troops.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe DCCC cites a vote in a footnote at the bottom of the screen in support of the claim, but that footnote doesn&rsquo;t tell the whole story.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot even close.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin noted, that vote -- and others cited by the DCCC in other ads -- come from spring 2011, when an extended partisan tussle over spending cuts brought the federal government close to a shutdown. One of the sticky issues was how to deal with congressional pay and military pay if a shutdown occurred. There was plenty of maneuvering for partisan advantage and both parties claimed they were on the side of the troops.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn May 26, 2011 -- after the funding crisis was averted with passage of a bill with military appropriations through the remainder of fiscal 2011 -- the House debated a defense authorization bill for the following year, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats called for a vote on a motion to boost pay for combat troops.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, called it transparently political: &quot;We had all kinds of time to bring an amendment that would be helpful like this, then they bring this one. There&#39;s no offset. This would just put us again above the allocation from the chairman. This is really more Democrat increasing spending.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe motion failed, with Renacci in opposition.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat the DCCC ad doesn&rsquo;t say is that the full bill -- supported by Renacci, nearly all Republicans and 95 Democrats, including Betty Sutton -- already included a pay hike of 1.6 percent in the monthly basic pay for members of the uniformed services. That covered combat troops as well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Renacci didn&rsquo;t vote for the additional bump proposed at the very end of the process, but he voted -- the same day -- for the increased pay level in the underlying bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThink of it this way: There is a bill to increase spending by $500,000 for a particular program. An amendment is offered to increase it to $750,000. If a person votes against the amendment but for the bill, are they &quot;voting against an increase in spending&quot; for the program?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also note that the Democratic amendment in question, like the others cited by the DCCC, was a &quot;motion to recommit,&quot; a prerogative of the minority party since the first Congress. They are motions, partly procedural, that attempt to send a bill back to committee just before passage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Both parties, when in the minority, have used these to make political statements and embarrass the majority for partisan advantage,&quot; said Donald Wolfensberger, an expert on parliamentary rules who was a key Republican staffer for the House Rules Committee in the 1990s. &quot;It is well understood in modern times that these are designed for partisan campaign purposes and usually have little to do with better policy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth parties, when in the minority, contend the motions can have merit and are not purely procedural.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat is the merit of the Democratic TV ad charging that Renacci &quot;opposed increasing combat bonuses for our troops&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim is based on Renacci&rsquo;s vote on a &quot;motion to recommit&quot; that preceded a final vote on military pay. Such motions are routinely denied by the majority party as procedural moves. That gives the minority party the chance to structure them for partisan advantage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s what is playing out in the ad now.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-23T16:56:24.663291", "ruling_date": "2012-10-24T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "DCCC says Jim Renacci voted against combat bonuses for troops", "ruling_headline_slug": "dccc-says-jim-renacci-voted-against-combat-bonuses", "ruling_link_text": "\"No\" on a procedural vote but \"Yes\" on passage", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXJ0tsi40s&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Jim Renacci: Earned</a>,&quot; Oct. 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Wisconsin, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/16/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democratic-group-says-duffy-voted-against-pay-incr/\">Democratic group says Duffy voted against pay increases for troops but in favor of protecting his own salary</a>,&quot; Sept. 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail from the Renacci campaign, Oct. 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional roll call vote, <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/h374\">House Vote #374 (On motion to recommit with instructions: H.R. 1540 to authorize appropriations)</a>, May 26, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional roll call vote, <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/h375\">House Vote #375 (On passage of H.R. 1540: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012)</a>, May 26, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 13, "current_job": "", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 7, "home_state": "", "id": 652, "last_name": "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "democratic-congressional-campaign-committee", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-mugs_mug-dnc_.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/652/", "total_count": 38, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.dccc.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Jim Renacci &quot;opposed increasing combat bonuses for our troops.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a television ad", "statement_date": "2012-10-24", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 219, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/219/", "subject": "Message Machine 2012", "subject_slug": "message-machine-2012", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/", "/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 30, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/30/", "subject": "Military", "subject_slug": "military", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "U.S. representative ", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Jim", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 606, "last_name": "Renacci", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "jim-renacci", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-renacci_2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/606/", "total_count": 19, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://jimrenacci.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
