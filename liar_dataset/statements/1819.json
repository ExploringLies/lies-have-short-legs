Rick Perry wasted government dollars flying to Texas  cities to give out money.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In three days last  week, Perry flew to five cities at taxpayers&rsquo; expense, holding press  conferences, delivering $2,325,000 in checks,&rdquo; White&rsquo;s 8:43 p.m. post  states.</p>\r\n<p>Did Perry burn tax dollars to hand out checks?</p>\r\n<p>Katy Bacon, White&rsquo;s spokeswoman, pointed out news releases  issued by the governor&rsquo;s office reflecting Perry&rsquo;s stops May 11-13 in  Corpus Christi, Dallas, San Antonio, Palacios and San Juan. The releases  state that Perry announced spending awards of $150,000, $175,000 and $2  million, respectively, in Dallas, Palacios and San Juan. Perry did not  ballyhoo funding awards in the other cities, according to the releases.</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s close to what White said on Facebook: Three days, five  cities, $2,325,000 in checks handed over by Perry.</p>\r\n<p>We  wondered, though, at White&rsquo;s description of Perry&rsquo;s flights as costing  taxpayers. For years, Perry has funded considerable out-of-town  travel, for state business or campaign purposes, from non-state sources  including his campaign kitty &mdash; an approach often mentioned in news articles,  including a July 26 report in White&rsquo;s hometown newspaper, the Houston  Chronicle.</p>\r\n<p>The Chronicle article quotes Perry&rsquo;s  gubernatorial spokeswoman, Allison Castle, noting that &ldquo;Perry's travel  is not paid by taxpayers.&rdquo; It continues: &ldquo;Texas One, a corporate-finance  foundation, pays for much of Perry's business development travel. Other  travel is paid for by his political committee or campaign donors. And  some is financed as in-kind contributions from specific wealthy donors  or interest groups.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As for the flights Facebooked by  White, Bacon told us in an e-mail: &ldquo;These were all &lsquo;official&rsquo; trips and  events under the Office of the Governor, and this type of travel is  typically paid for by taxpayers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Not so, said Castle,  who informed us the flights under fire, on private planes, were funded by Perry&rsquo;s  campaign. &ldquo;The majority of the governor&rsquo;s travel is paid for by his  campaign,&rdquo; she said. For each of the five stops referenced by White, she  said, one state-paid travel aide and a press aide accompanied Perry.</p>\r\n<p>There is another cost the public pays for every Perry trip &mdash;  his security detail. In a  follow-up interview, Bacon took no issue with gubernatorial security  expenses.</p>\r\n<p>Bacon also stood by White's characterization of the travel as  taxpayer-funded, saying it would take time to confirm, with documents,  that Perry's flights were not paid for by the state. Then again, Bacon  said, spending campaign funds on the flights also doesn't pass muster.</p>\r\n<p>\"Either way, this is wrong,\" she said. \"He&rsquo;s running around handing out  taxpayer dollars to get headlines for his political career. He&rsquo;s using  campaign dollars to hand out state checks.\" She showed us that Perry's  campaign excerpted two press releases from the latest trips in a  campaign e-mail blast.</p>\r\n<p>Bacon's charge shifts the  focus from who paid for Perry's trips to the purpose of his stops. That's not what White critiqued on Facebook.</p>\r\n<p>All in all,  White got several things right &mdash; five cities visited, press events,  money awards. And it's true the state pays some costs any time the  governor goes anywhere.</p>\r\n<p>But White's crucial  assumption &mdash; that Perry's flights were at taxpayers' expense &mdash; is wrong.  It's a misstep the candidate might have avoided by reading his local  newspaper.</p>\r\n<p>Pants on Fire!</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-05-21T19:11:37.135965", "ruling_date": "2010-05-23T06:44:04", "ruling_headline": "White says taxpayers paid for Perry to fly Texas delivering checks in five communities", "ruling_headline_slug": "white-says-taxpayers-paid-perry-fly-texas-deliveri", "ruling_link_text": "White could have read up first", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Austin American-Statesman, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/06012009_aasnewsarticle.doc\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Bill   lets Perry's security details stay secret, Measure counters state  appeals court ruling to disclose,&rdquo;</a> June 1, 2009</p>\r\n<p>The  Houston Chronicle, <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6547566.html\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Perry's   a long way from the cotton farm,&rdquo;</a> July 26, 2010 (accessed May 20,  2010)</p>\r\n<p>Governor's Office, press releases from stops in  Corpus Christi, Dallas, San Juan, Palacios and San Antonio, <a href=\"http://governor.state.tx.us/news/press-release/14611/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Gov.
