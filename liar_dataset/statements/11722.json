Federal funding to Planned Parenthood does not go toward abortions and is instead used to fund the organization&rsquo;s other services, such as sexually transmitted disease testing and treatment, mammograms and contraceptive services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the interview, Dunham asked Richards about changes in the politics of abortion rights over Richards&rsquo; nine years as president of Planned Parenthood. Richards,<strong> </strong>eldest daughter to Ann Richards, the late former Texas governor,<strong> </strong>replied by mentioning the partisan realignment of legislatures in 2010, which mostly benefited Republicans, and the Republican Party&rsquo;s national shift to the right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But if you look at the people in this country,&quot; Richards continued, &quot;they are supportive of safe and legal abortion. They support Planned Parenthood. I was just looking at the recent numbers. More than 60 percent of people in America support Planned Parenthood, and only 11 percent approve of Congress.&quot; Those numbers, Richards said, show that &quot;just because the politics are going one way, it&rsquo;s not because that&rsquo;s where the people are.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where the people are is a pretty broad assessment. We focused on whether Richards was right about the relative popularity of Planned Parenthood and unpopularity of Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Congressional approval</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress hasn&rsquo;t been widely admired very often. As we noted in <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1JeukAH\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a December 2014 story</u></a>, the Gallup polling organization started inquiring into attitudes toward Congress in 1974. Its results show Congress never proving very popular, except after the 9/11 attacks, when there was a spike to 84 percent of respondents approving of the job Congress was doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most recent<a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>Gallup poll</u></a> available at the time of Richards&rsquo; interview placed public approval of Congress at 11 percent. (After that, according to Gallup, support edged up to 13 percent.) The poll, conducted from Nov. 4 to Nov. 8, 2015, asked respondents, &quot;Do you approve or disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job?&quot; A whopping 86 percent disapproved, and 3 percent had no opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eleven percent approval was a low point for Congress in 2015. Twenty percent approved of Congress in February 2015, and 19 percent approved in May 2015. Approval<strong> </strong>of Congress declined starting in May 2015, reaching 14 percent in August 2015 and 13 percent in October 2015, before hitting 11 percent the next month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A<a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/mood_of_america/congressional_performance\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>poll</u></a> released Dec. 3, 1015, by Rasmussen Reports placed public support for Congress even lower: 9 percent of likely voters said Congress was doing a good or excellent job according to Rasmussen&rsquo;s methodology, which in 2015 often returned lower favorability numbers than Gallup&rsquo;s polls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Support for Planned Parenthood funding</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reviewing the other end of Richards&rsquo; claim, we recognized two ways to gauge &quot;support&quot; for Planned Parenthood. Polls in 2015 inquired into U.S. attitudes about ending federal aid to the group and about general feelings about the group which, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2015/oct/22/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-planned-parenthood-does-nothing-p/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>we&rsquo;ve noted</u></a>, provides family planning and other women&rsquo;s health services, including abortions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planned Parenthood, asked for the factual backup to Richards&rsquo; statement, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ynAWewEN4HjPYT_Fopm_C2Tblf2JhjpfiBQM57pcWtQ/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>pointed us</u></a> to several surveys showing support for the group itself and support for its funding as well as opposition to shutting down the government rather than continuing<strong> </strong>its aid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Oct. 14, 2015, PolitiFact<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/14/gwen-moore/six-10-americans-back-federal-money-planned-parent/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> Wisconsin <u>fact-check</u></a> found True this September 2015 claim by Wisconsin Democrat Gwen Moore<strong>:</strong> &quot;60 percent of all Americans do not want to see Planned Parenthood defunded.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three September 2015<strong> </strong>surveys--similarly cited<strong> </strong>by Planned Parenthood when we made our recent inquiry--seemed to back<strong> </strong>Moore&rsquo;s claim:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull;&nbsp;</strong>A NBC News/Wall Street Journal<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/nbc-wsj-poll-6-10-oppose-defunding-planned-parenthood-n434911\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>poll</u></a> of adults asked: &quot;Would you favor or oppose totally eliminating federal funding to Planned Parenthood for family planning and preventative health services?&quot; Sixty-one percent of respondents opposed eliminating federal funding to Planned Parenthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull;&nbsp;</strong>A USA Today/Suffolk University<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/09/29/poll-2-1-funding-planned-parenthood-supported/73016440/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>poll</u></a> of likely voters asked: &quot;Do you think all federal funding for Planned Parenthood should be cut off: yes or no?&quot; Sixty-five percent said no. A similar <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/12/07/poll-most-oppose-defunding-planned-parenthood/76913724/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>poll</u></a> conducted in December 2015 saw that number down slightly at 58 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull;&nbsp;</strong>A Pew Research Center<a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2015/09/28/majority-says-any-budget-deal-must-include-planned-parenthood-funding/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>poll</u></a> tied Planned Parenthood funding to a possible government shutdown in its question but got a similar result: 60 percent of adults said any federal budget agreement to avert a government shutdown would have to maintain funding for Planned Parenthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another survey, however, did find support for eliminating Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s funding. Released Dec. 2, 2015, the poll from the Robert Morris University Polling Institute found that 53.3 percent of respondents supported defunding Planned Parenthood, and 31.5 percent opposed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The RMU polling institute speculated in its news release that the starkly different response stemmed from the wording used in the polling question. The RMU poll asked respondents: &quot;Congressional Republicans favor shifting Planned Parenthood federal funds to community clinics that perform the same services, but do not perform abortions. Would you say you support or oppose this plan?&quot; Other polls generally asked a version of the question, &quot;Do you think all federal funding to Planned Parenthood should be cut off?&quot; without mentioning clinics, services, or abortions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The RMU poll stood alone in finding support for defunding Planned Parenthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Support for Planned Parenthood</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Survey questions asking directly about support for Planned Parenthood in itself &mdash; rather than its government backing &mdash; had positive responses, at lower numbers than the 60 percent mark. These polls all asked a version of the simple question, &quot;Is your opinion of Planned Parenthood favorable or unfavorable?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Oct. 6, 2015, <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/september_2015/support_for_planned_parenthood_holds_steady\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>poll</u></a> by Rasmussen Reports, which Planned Parenthood also shared with us, found that 53 percent of likely voters had a favorable opinion of Planned Parenthood, with a margin of error of 3 percent. A <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bloomberg National Poll</u></a> in November 2015 got 50 percent favorability for the organization, with the same margin of error. A Sept. 28, 2015, <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2285\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>poll</u></a> from Quinnipiac University delivered lower numbers: it found that 44 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of Planned Parenthood, compared with 39 percent unfavorable, with a 2.5 percent margin of error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lowest favorability ratings came from a September 2015 <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>CBS News/New York Times poll</u></a>, which found 40 percent in favor and 27 percent not in favor. Thirty-one percent in that poll said they did not know enough to answer the question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBy email, Planned Parenthood media relations assistant Claire Barnes pointed to an Aug. 5, 2015, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/how-public-views-planned-parenthood-nra-n403451\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>NBC News/</u><u>Wall Street Journal</u><u> poll</u></a> that put Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s favorability ratings in context. The poll found Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s 45 percent favorability rating was higher than favorability ratings for the NRA, the Supreme Court, Bernie Sanders, President Barack Obama and several Republican presidential candidates included in the survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richards said that more than 60 percent of people in America support Planned Parenthood, and only 11 percent approve of Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richards had a bead on Congress, which was wallowing in 11-percent approval territory in November 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, most polls suggested more than 60 percent of Americans opposed the federal defunding of Planned Parenthood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, there&rsquo;s clarification missing. While more people look favorably on Planned Parenthood than not, polls indicated, that was the opinion of 40 percent to 53 percent of Americans--not more than 60 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Richards&rsquo;
