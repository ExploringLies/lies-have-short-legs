A video clip of Barack Obama bashing the candidate is a good  start.<br /><br />Someone who is apparently not a fan of Georgia Attorney  General Thurbert Baker, a Democratic gubernatorial contender, created a  professional-looking YouTube video attacking him. It begins with a  picture of Baker with the \"Ghostbusters\" symbol. \"Thurbert Baker for  Governor?\" reads the headline on the video, created June 10.<br /><br />Baker's  position in the controversial Genarlow Wilson case is the focus of the  three-minute video posted by \"concernedcitizen4u\". <br /><br />The video  also includes civil rights stalwarts the Revs. Joseph Lowery and Al  Sharpton taking Baker to task.<br /><br />Baker is in a crowded Democratic  field seeking that party's nomination to become the state's next leader.  To win, or at least get in a runoff, a Democratic candidate must  capture a significant portion of the state's African-American vote.  Blacks make up about half the Democratic voter base in Georgia.<br /><br />Baker  is black. The other leading Democratic candidates are white.<br /><br />Whoever  posted the video -- and at this point that person or political campaign  remains unknown -- apparently is trying to undermine Baker's support in  the black community by using a 3-year-old statement by the man who is  now president of the United States. Then-candidate Obama assailed Baker  for pursuing the case against Wilson, who is also black.<br /><br />This is a  stealth political attack at its lethal best. Brutally blunt, it focuses  on a target audience and is virtually untraceable.&nbsp; <br /><br />But is it  true?<br /><br />The Baker camp said no.<br /><br />\"This isn't the first time a  false attack has been spread anonymously ... and it won't be the last,\"  Baker campaign manager Jeff DiSantis said. \"It's a pack of lies.\"<br /><br />Wilson,  you may remember, was convicted in 2005 of felony aggravated child  molestation for what he said was consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old  girl. Wilson was 17 at the time of the incident and faced 10 years in  prison after he was convicted. Some activists suggested prosecutors  treated Wilson harshly because he is black. The accusations of racial  discrimination, added to a story about sex, generated national news  coverage.<br /><br />In 2006, the state Legislature changed the law <span class=\"text\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">to make similar acts between teens a  misdemeanor, punishable by up to 12 months in prison. The changes,  however, did not apply to Wilson and anyone else already imprisoned on  such charges. So he remained in prison.<br /><br />Not fair, Obama said.<br /><br />The  Democrat referred to the Wilson case in several speeches in 2007 during  his run for president. Obama compared Wilson's case to I. Lewis  \"Scooter\" Libby, the former chief of staff to Republican Vice President  Dick Cheney. President George W. Bush decided to commute Libby's sentence after he was  convicted of perjury and obstruction in a CIA leak case.<br /><br />\"You've  got Scooter Libby not serving any jail time. But you've got a young man,  a football player who didn't even commit a felony, who's being locked  up for 10 years, then it's harder for you to say you stand up for  justice in America,\" Obama said in one campaign speech that was  recorded.<br /><br />The crowd cheered.<br /></span></span><br />The video ends  with audio replaying some of Obama's speech.<br /><br />\"It's harder for you  to say you stand for justice in America.\"<br /><br />Video of the future  president questioning your commitment to justice can't be good for Baker  in a Democratic primary.<br /><br /><span class=\"text\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The video does not say when Obama's remarks were  recorded. But an Atlanta Journal-Constitution account of Obama's visit  to Atlanta in August 2007 said he made comments about Libby and Wilson  at that time. </span></span><br /><br />There's one problem with Obama's  comments. State law 16-6-4 said at the time of Wilson's conviction that  aggravated child molestation was a felony.<br /><br />Monroe County Superior  Court Judge Thomas H. Wilson (no relation to Genarlow) ruled in June  2007 that the case was a misdemeanor and that Genarlow Wilson should be  freed. Baker appealed the ruling, saying Judge Wilson overstepped his  authority. The attorney general said at the time he was worried the  ruling had the potential to allow other convicted child molesters to be  freed. Baker was quoted in the AJC as saying he thought the 10-year  sentence was \"harsh.\"<br /><br />But, Baker also said: \"I took an oath to  uphold the laws of this state. And in taking that oath, I don't have the  luxury of taking the law into my own hands or picking which cases to  defend.\"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />The Georgia Supreme Court ruled 4-3 in October 2007  that Genarlow Wilson should be freed.<br /><br />We tried to reach  \"concernedcitizen4u\", but our efforts have been unsuccessful.<br /><br />People  who watch the video may get the wrong impression about the case. Wilson  was indeed convicted of a felony. So Obama's comments about the case in  2007 were incorrect. We believe the video is misleading and rule that  this item is False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-17T17:48:11.263121", "ruling_date": "2010-06-18T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Obama speech used to attack Democratic candidate", "ruling_headline_slug": "video-uses-obama-speech-attack-baker", "ruling_link_text": "Stealth attack video featuring Obama felonious", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-0Sh02xuRw\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>, June 10, 2010.<br /><br />The  Atlanta Journal-Constitution, June 12, 2007<br /><br />The Atlanta  Journal-Constitution, June 15, 2007<br /><br />The Atlanta  Journal-Constitution, Aug. 5, 2007<br /><br />E-mail from Baker campaign  manager Jeff DiSantis, June 17, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 457, "last_name": "Concernedcitizen4U", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "concernedcitizen4u", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Anonymous_people.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/457/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Thurbert Baker kept a teen in jail \"who didn't even commit a felony.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a video", "statement_date": "2010-06-10", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Attorney General", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Thurbert", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 444, "last_name": "Baker", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "thurbert-baker", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/ThurbertBaker.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/444/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": null}
