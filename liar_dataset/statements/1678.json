Jon Kyl of Arizona, who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said he thought  a filibuster was unlikely, but he wasn't taking it entirely off the  table as an option. Kyl appeared on ABC News' <em>This Week</em>, alongside  Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York. <br /><br />\"President Obama  himself attempted to filibuster Justice Alito, who now sits on the  Supreme Court,\" Kyl said. \"So if the president isn't going to take it  off the table, I'm not going to take it off the table. But I think it  can easily be avoided by appointing, frankly, the kind of person that  Senator Schumer just mentioned, someone who is mainstream enough that  with intellect and the application of good law can persuade colleagues  to support his position or her position.\"<br /><br />We wanted to examine  whether Kyl was correct about Obama's position on then-Judge Samuel  Alito back in 2006, when Obama was a senator and Alito was President  George W. Bush's nominee.<br /><br />We found that Obama did join a broader  Democratic effort to filibuster Alito. Democrats said Alito opposed  abortion and was too deferential to executive power.<br /><br />But in  what's become Obama's trademark on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand  style, he joined the filibuster while at the same time saying he thought  it was a bad idea. <br /><br />Here's what he told George Stephanopoulos on  Jan. 29, 2006:<br /><br />Stephanopoulos: \"Two of your colleagues, Senator  (Edward) Kennedy and Senator (John) Kerry, want to try to mount a  filibuster tomorrow. Will you join them?\"<br /><br />Obama: \"Well, I will be  supporting the filibuster because I think Judge Alito, in fact, is  somebody who is contrary to core American values, not just liberal  values, you know. When you look at his decisions in particular during  times of war, we need a court that is independent and is going to  provide some check on the executive branch, and he has not shown himself  willing to do that repeatedly. I will say this, though, I think that  the Democrats have to do a much better job in making their case on these  issues. These last-minute efforts using procedural maneuvers inside the  Beltway, I think, has been the wrong way of going about it, and we need  to recognize, because Judge Alito will be confirmed, that if we're  going to oppose a nominee that we've got to persuade the American people  that, in fact, their values are at stake and frankly I'm not sure that  we've successfully done that.\"<br /><br />Stephanopoulos: \"Well, it sounds  to me like you're not really happy about going forward and joining this  filibuster. And I've actually seen some reports that inside the  Democratic caucus you were arguing against this strategy. Is that true?\"<br /><br />Obama:  \"Well, you know, I don't talk about what I, you know, what takes place  in caucus but what I will say is that there is an over-reliance on the  part of Democrats for procedural maneuvers and mechanisms to block the  president instead of proactively going out to the American people and  talking about the values that we care about. And, you know, there's one  way to guarantee that the judges who are appointed to the Supreme Court  are judges that reflect our values and that's to win elections.\"<br /><br />Later  that day, a report from the Associated Press carried the headline,  \"Sen. Obama Criticizes Filibuster Tactic.\"<br /><br />The next day,  Democrats failed in their attempt to filibuster on a vote of 72 to 25,  with <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00001\" target=\"_blank\">Obama  joining 24 other Democrats</a> on the losing end. <br /><br />Obama may  have criticized the filibuster even as he joined it, but at the end of  the day, he still joined it. Kyl said, \"President Obama himself  attempted to filibuster Justice Alito, who now sits on the Supreme  Court.\" We rate Kyl's statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-04-11T15:59:50.561528", "ruling_date": "2010-04-11T16:37:40", "ruling_headline": "Obama criticized Supreme Court filibuster of Alito even as he joined it", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-criticized-supreme-court-filibuster-alito-ev", "ruling_link_text": "Obama, the coy filibuster-er", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC News, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/supreme-court-vacancy-10344589\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Supreme Court Vacancy: Sen.
