Bo, the Portuguese water dog that Senator Ted Kennedy gave to the Obama family as a present, apparently flies in his own private jet.

Is Bo really commanding his own jet? We decided to look into it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe quickly traced the origin of the rumors to the Morning Sentinel, a newspaper based in Waterville, Maine. On July 17, 2010, the paper published an account of the First Family&#39;s visit to the state&#39;s Acadia National Park. Among the details was a reference to Bo.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Arriving in a small jet before the Obamas was the first dog, Bo, a Portuguese water dog given as a present by the late U.S. Sen Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and the president&#39;s personal aide Reggie Love, who chatted with Baldacci,&quot; the article stated. It seems that some people took this to mean that Bo actually arrived in his own jet.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAir Force One is usually a Boeing 747, but the Trenton airport runway was too small for the plane, so the Obamas opted for a Gulfstream G3, the article stated. That plane can accommodate up to 19 passengers. To fit everyone in -- the President always travels with multiple staffers and aides -- the Obamas decided to travel in two smaller airplanes, the second of which carried several White House aides and Bo.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, the Sentinel article was updated to clarify that there were many other people in the jet that carried Bo. &quot;Today&#39;s story about the arrival of the Obamas said the Obamas&#39; dog and one aide arrived on a small jet before the First Family, but there were other occupants on the plane, including several other staffers. The presidential party took two small jets to the Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport in Trenton because the airport was too small to accommodate the president&#39;s usual jet.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo be thorough, we also checked with the White House. Katherine Bedingfield of the White House Office of Media Affairs told us that the claim is &quot;baseless and absurd.&quot; Bo does not even require his own seat, and during the Maine trip he traveled on a government-owned plane with White House staff.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe figured that at least some of the bloggers were being satirical, but from our review of reader comments that followed many of the entries, it&#39;s pretty clear that there are those who actually took this stuff seriously, so we wanted to set the record straight.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Bo did indeed arrive in a separate jet, but it&#39;s ridiculous to claim that he has his own airplane. He traveled on a government-owned plane with government staffers who didn&#39;t fit in the small Gulfstream G3 that the First Family had to take because of the physical limitations of the Trenton airport runway. We rate this False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-21T16:10:48.900027", "ruling_date": "2010-07-22T11:16:09", "ruling_headline": "Bloggers claim Bo flies in his own plane", "ruling_headline_slug": "bloggers-claim-bo-flies-his-own-plane", "ruling_link_text": "Is Bo the master of the skies?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tMorning Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.onlinesentinel.com/news/white-house-wanderers-tour-acadia_2010-07-16.html\">White House wanderers tour Acadia</a>, by Rebekah Metzler, July 17, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPublius Forum, <a href=\"http://www.publiusforum.com/2010/07/17/noblesse-oblige-obama-s-dog-gets-own-plane-on-vacation-trip/\">Noblesse Oblige: Obama&rsquo;s Dog Gets Own Plane on Vacation Trip</a>, by Warner Todd Huston, July 17, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSnopes, <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/bo.asp\">Dog Daze</a>, July 18, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMichelle Malkin, <a href=\"http://michellemalkin.com/2010/07/17/obamas-dog/\">Just Plane Crazy: Obama&rsquo;s Dog Flies to Vacation on Separate Jet</a>, by Doug Powers, July 17, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIronic Surrealism, <a href=\"http://ironicsurrealism.blogivists.com/2010/07/17/first-dog-bo-has-a-private-jet/\">First Dog Bo Flown to Maine in His Own Private Jet</a>, July 17, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFireAndreaMitchell.com, <a href=\"http://www.fireandreamitchell.com/2010/07/17/obama-dog-bo-gets-his-own-seperate-private-jet-to-take-him-to-maine/\">Obama dog BO gets his own seperate private jet to take him to Maine</a>, July 17, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Blogmocracy, <a href=\"http://www.theblogmocracy.com/2010/07/18/obamas-dog-bo-flew-on-a-small-air-force-private-jet-to-maine-before-the-obamas-arrived/\">Obama&rsquo;s dog &quot;Bo&quot; flew on a &quot;small&quot; Air Force private jet to Maine before the Obamas arrived</a>, July 18, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNews Real Blog, <a href=\"http://www.newsrealblog.com/2010/07/18/believe-it-or-not-obamas-dog-flies-to-maine-on-his-own-private-jet/\">Believe it or Not: Obama&rsquo;s Dog Flies to Maine on His Own Private Jet</a>, by M.
