Bush&rsquo;s point man in getting Congress to approve Part D, touts the prescription drug program as an important benefit for senior citizens. And he chides Baldwin for voting against it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an Oct. 24, 2012, meeting with <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> editors and reporters, Baldwin explained why she voted no.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I want you to know I support strongly Medicare Part D,&quot; the Madison congresswoman said, &quot;but I would have paid for it. And that&#39;s why I voted no, it was because it was unfunded.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin has been portrayed in the campaign as anything but a fiscal hawk.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, did she really cite the lack of a tax increase or other funding mechanism when she opposed the program?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The program and the vote</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/index.html\">Medicare Part D</a> is an optional insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare. Private insurance companies offer a variety of plans, and recipients choose the plan that&#39;s best for them. When the program was created in 2003, the government subsidy to help recipients buy their drugs was estimated to cost $394 billion over 10 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/04/tammy-baldwin/uncle-sam-barred-bargaining-medicare-drug-prices-s/\">True</a> a claim by Baldwin that the Part D law, &quot;adopted under Thompson&rsquo;s watch,&quot; bars the government from negotiating for &quot;better prices&quot; on prescription drugs. Thompson&rsquo;s was Bush&rsquo;s health and human services secretary at the time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve also rated as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/30/tommy-thompson/tommy-thompson-says-he-had-nothing-do-provision-ba/\">Mostly False</a> a Thompson claim that he &quot;had nothing to do&quot; with the clause in Part D that prevents the government from negotiating drug prices for Part D.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus did not respond to our requests for evidence that Baldwin voted against Part D because it was unfunded. But we found a half dozen statements made by Baldwin at the time, which make clear what her quarrel with the measure was when it passed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>June 22, 2002:</strong> In a <a href=\"http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/news/press-releases/2002/06/floor-statement-baldwin-calls-for-prescription-drug-coverage.shtml\">statement</a> on the House floor, a year before the initial House <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/108-2003/h332\">vote</a>, Baldwin called the GOP&rsquo;s Part D bill a &quot;sham,&quot; saying senior citizens &quot;need a comprehensive prescription drug benefit that has no gaps or gimmicks in coverage. They need real prescription drug coverage under Medicare.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>June 28, 2003:</strong> After the initial House vote, Baldwin said in a news article in <em>The Capital Times</em> of Madison that she voted against the bill because it would force senior citizens into health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations that, unlike Medicare, limit their choice of doctors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>July 21, 2003:</strong> Baldwin said in a <a href=\"http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/news/press-releases/2003/07/baldwin-hears-input-on-prescription-drug-plans.shtml\">news release</a>s he voted against the bill because it &nbsp;&quot;creates a gaping hole that fails to cover millions of seniors.&quot; She also said there were concerns about the bill leading to the privatization of Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Nov. 21, 2003:</strong> In <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-11-21/pdf/CREC-2003-11-21-pt1-PgH12230-2.pdf#page=5\">remarks</a> on the House floor prior to the final House vote, Baldwin repeated several of her criticisms, noting the federal government is barred from negotiating drug prices under Part D.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Nov. 22, 2003:</strong> In an <a href=\"http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/images/headers/op%20ed%20medicare.pdf\">opinion piece</a> for <em>The Capital Times</em>, Baldwin said the GOP bill &quot;offers a meager prescription drug benefit, does nothing to control the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs and begins to dismantle the entire Medicare program.&quot; The same day, Baldwin <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2003/roll669.xml\">voted</a> against the bill that was signed into law; it passed, 220-215, largely along party lines.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Dec. 8, 2003:</strong> In a <a href=\"http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/news/press-releases/2003/12/rep-baldwin-bush-signing-of-medicare-bill-marks-beginning-of-the-end-of-medicare.shtml\">news release</a> on the day Bush signed Medicare Part D, Baldwin made the same criticism she did in the opinion article.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn general, Democratic critics complained that expanding the role for private insurers would undermine traditional Medicare. There were also conservative critics, who said the bill didn&rsquo;t do enough to contain Medicare costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Baldwin at the time cited a host of reasons for voting no -- that the measure &nbsp;left some seniors without coverage, that it undermines traditional Medicare, that it does not control prescription drug costs, that the federal government is barred from negotiating drug prices.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in the statements we found, there was nothing about the bill being &quot;unfunded,&quot; which Baldwin now says is the reason for her opposition.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the heat of the Senate campaign, Baldwin said she voted against the Medicare Part D prescription drug program &quot;because it was unfunded.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the time, Baldwin cited a number of reasons for opposing the program.
