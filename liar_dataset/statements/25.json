Yikes. He got the first one right, but that 70 percent figure? That's not just wrong, that's Pants-On-Fire wrong. The real figure, according to the June 2007 report of the Bureau of Justice Statistics that counts federal, state and local jails, is 40 percent.\n</p>\n<p>\n We're giving Gravel our harshest ruling because he botched this fact so badly and because it's such an important one to get right. It's something of a popular myth that most of the people in jail or prison are black, so to hear a presidential candidate make the false claim with such authority should not be overlooked. It also is worth noting that the 2.3 million figure that Gravel got right comes from the very same Bureau of Justice report that shows how wrong he was about the incarceration of black people. He should have kept reading.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:39.039142", "ruling_date": "2007-08-30T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "He's off, way off on who's in prison", "ruling_headline_slug": "hes-off-way-off-on-whos-in-prison", "ruling_link_text": "He's off, way off on who's in prison", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n <a href=\"http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/pjim06.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, \"Prison and Jail Inmates at Midyear 2006,\" June 2007\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://www.albany.edu/sourcebook/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice and State University of New York at Albany\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/democratic_debate_part_3.html \" target=\"_blank\">\n  Factcheck.org, Annenberg Public Policy Center\n </a>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Author and lecturer", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Mike", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Alaska", "id": 12, "last_name": "Gravel", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "mike-gravel", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 5, "party": "Libertarian", "party_slug": "libertarian", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/5/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-mikegravel.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/12/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.gravel2008.us/"}, "statement": "<p>\"In 1972, we had a 179,000 human beings in jail in this country.
