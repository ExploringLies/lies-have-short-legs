The energy experts we interviewed did not dispute that 5-million 2.5-megawatt windmills, operating under normal conditions, would produce energy equal to and surpassing total U.S. energy consumption of about 9-billion megawatt hours per year.\n</p>\n<p>\n So, it's true, but not at all realistic.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"Technically it could be that big, but it wouldn't be economically feasible,\" said Ryan Wiser, a staff scientist with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n</p>\n<p>\n Wind is described as an intermittent energy source because the wind doesn't always blow. So power production from windmills varies. It's not cost-efficient or practical to store the quantities of wind power you would need to power the entire country consistently, Wiser said.\n</p>\n<p>\n Researchers are debating the potential of supplying 20 percent of U.S. electrical consumption via wind turbines, the term for electricity-producing windmills. Hitting 20 percent is considered controversial and ambitious. Wiser said scientific studies are still in draft form, but they look promising.\n</p>\n<p>\n Currently, the United States gets between 0.8 and 1 percent of its electricity from wind power.\n</p>\n<p>\n President Bush has spoken approvingly of wind energy, because of its minimal impact on the environment. The\n <i>\n  Wall Street Journal\n </i>\n reported in July 2007 that the U.S. wind industry, which has lagged behind its counterpart in Europe, is now ramping up. Demand is strong for the high-tech parts used to build wind turbines, so much so that shortages are preventing new projects from starting.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
