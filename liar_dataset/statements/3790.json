Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- which would make deep spending cuts, hold the line on taxes and significantly change Medicare for those younger than 55 -- has become a key battleground between the two parties.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe plan won passage in the House, with almost all Republicans and no Democrats voting for it. But Democrats have made the dangers of Ryan&rsquo;s proposed changes to Medicare a major talking point, seeking to pin Republicans down on whether they support Ryan&rsquo;s vision.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich prompted a media firestorm for seeming to change his position on the Ryan plan. We rated Gingrich&rsquo;s position a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/18/newt-gingrich/did-newt-gingrich-flip-flop-supporting-paul-ryans-/\">Full Flop</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, Sen. Scott Brown -- the Republican who won a special election in 2010 to fill the Massachusetts seat long held by the late Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy -- is attracting attention for his own possible flip-flop.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to <a href=\"http://m.newburyportnews.com/TDNN/db_/contentdetail.htm;jsessionid=53F293CC585663AE8720A3CBD332E449?contentguid=ePVtN2fp&amp;full=true#display\">the <em>Newburyport Daily News</em></a> -- a newspaper in northeastern Massachusetts -- Brown made reference to the Ryan plan during an annual luncheon of the Greater Newburyport Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry on May 13, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The leaders will bring forward (Ryan&#39;s) budget, and I will vote for it, and it will fail,&quot; Brown said. &quot;Then the president will bring forward his budget, and it will fail. It will be great fodder for the commercials.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTen days later, Brown authored an <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/55477.html\">op-ed</a> in the political newspaper <em>POLITICO</em> that was headlined, &quot;Why I don&#39;t back Paul Ryan&#39;s Medicare plan.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;While I applaud Ryan for getting the conversation started, I cannot support his specific plan &mdash; and therefore will vote &lsquo;no&rsquo; on his budget,&quot; Brown wrote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA &quot;no&quot; vote on the Ryan plan is considered safer for Brown. Massachusetts voters historically lean Democratic, and Republicans who win election are usually moderate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo in his Newburyport speech, Brown said he&rsquo;d vote for the Ryan plan, while in his op-ed 10 days later, he said he&rsquo;d vote against it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we took these two comments to Brown&rsquo;s press staff, spokesman Colin Reed said, &quot;He was making the point in Newburyport that political games are being played in Washington, but was not commenting on the merits of the bill.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe agree that in his Newburyport comment, Brown focuses on the gamesmanship of budget-writing in Washington rather than on the nitty-gritty of its policy details. Meanwhile, in the <em>POLITICO</em> column, Brown was careful to praise Ryan&rsquo;s role in starting the &quot;conversation&quot; even as he declared opposition to his plan. These suggest a somewhat nuanced position.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, Brown did indicate pretty clearly in Newburyport that he would cast a loyal GOP vote for the plan, even if he expected that the vote would ultimately prove fruitless. Then 10 days later, in the <em>POLITICO</em> op-ed, he made clear that he wasn&rsquo;t just disappointed by the Ryan plan but would definitely vote &quot;no.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnyone reading his comments in the Newburyport Daily News would be under the impression Brown was voting for the Ryan budget, but he&#39;s not. So we give Brown a Full Flop.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-23T12:39:26.011275", "ruling_date": "2011-05-23T16:01:05", "ruling_headline": "Did Scott Brown flip-flop on supporting Paul Ryan's budget plan?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-scott-brown-flip-flop-supporting-paul-ryans-bu", "ruling_link_text": "Clear-eyed about budget kabuki, but still switched from yes to no in 10 days", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<em>Newburyport Daily News</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://m.newburyportnews.com/TDNN/db_/contentdetail.htm;jsessionid=53F293CC585663AE8720A3CBD332E449?contentguid=ePVtN2fp&amp;full=true#display\">Senator gets candid about nation&#39;s troubles in speech to Greater Newburyport Chamber</a>,&quot; May 14, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott Brown, &quot;Why I don&#39;t back Paul Ryan&#39;s Medicare plan&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/55477.html\">op-ed</a> in <em>POLITICO</em>), May 23, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Colin Reed, spokesman for Scott Brown, May 23, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "New Hampshire", "id": 312, "last_name": "Brown", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "scott-brown", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Scott_Brown.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New Hampshire", "edition": "New Hampshire", "edition_slug": "new-hampshire", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 47, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New Hampshire Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/47/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/312/", "total_count": 10, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tOn whether he would vote for the budget proposed by Rep.
