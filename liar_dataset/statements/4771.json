He said he would eliminate an ethanol subsidy, make federal employees contribute more toward their pensions and save $10 million by reducing the size of the federal limousine fleet to what it was before President Barack Obama took office.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t&quot;Tell me why the limousine fleet has increased by 42 percent since Barack Obama took office,&quot; Neumann said. &quot;Why are we spending taxpayers&rsquo; money on that? Limos should be for weddings and proms, certainly not for government officials to be riding around in.&quot;<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tWell, we at PolitiFact Wisconsin take limos to work every day, so we&rsquo;re not sure what all the fuss is about ....<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tBut, seriously, Neumann&rsquo;s claim made us wonder whether the federal fancy fleet has indeed grown by 42 percent since Obama was <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/inaugural-address/\">inaugurated</a> in January 2009.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tFortunately for us, our colleagues at <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/\">PolitiFact National</a> have already been down this road.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tIn June 2011, presidential candidate and U.S. Rep. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/michele-bachmann/\">Michele Bachmann</a>, R-Minn., made a claim similar to Neumann&rsquo;s. She said on CBS&rsquo; &quot;Face the Nation&quot; that &quot;the number of federal limousines for bureaucrats has increased 73 percent&quot; under Obama.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tThat earned her a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/27/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-claims-federal-limousines-73-perc/\">Mostly False</a>.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tBachmann&rsquo;s claim was based on an <a href=\"http://www.iwatchnews.org/2011/05/31/4765/limousine-liberals-number-government-owned-limos-has-soared-under-obama\">article</a> by the non-partisan <a href=\"http://www.iwatchnews.org/about\">Center for Public Integrity</a>, which does investigative journalism. The article, citing annual federal <a href=\"http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/102943\">fleet reports</a>, said the number of limousines rose from 238 in fiscal 2008, the last year of the George W. Bush administration, to 412 -- including 259 limos in the State Department -- in 2010.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tThat would be a 73 percent increase.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tBut as our colleagues pointed out, the article itself quoted a spokeswoman for the General Services Administration, which tracks federal vehicles, as saying the limo figures were not reliable.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tThe spokeswoman said limousine had not been defined in the reports, which meant some vehicles listed as limos actually ranged from protective-duty vehicles to sedans. She also said her agency &quot;cannot say that its report accurately reflects the number of limousines.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tIn other words, there weren&rsquo;t any good numbers on the number of federal limos.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tThe General Services Administration promised at the time to fix its record keeping, so we contacted spokesman Gregory Mecher. He told us his agency issued a <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/FMRB-29+%282%29.pdf\">memo</a> after PolitiFact National&rsquo;s story was published, directing federal agencies on how to identify limos in their fleet reports. But those limo figures won&rsquo;t be available until January 2012, he said.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tSo, the limo numbers are still in limbo.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tWe asked Neumann campaign spokesman Chris Lato for evidence to back Neumann&rsquo;s claim. He cited the same flawed federal figures Bachmann did.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tIf the government reduced the number of limos from 412 to 238, as Neumann proposes, that would be a 42 percent decrease. But again, the agency that tracks federal vehicles says that, despite the published fleet statistics, it really doesn&rsquo;t know how many limos the federal government has -- and at least some in the count are not limos at all.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tNeumann said the federal limousine fleet &quot;has increased by 42 percent since Barack Obama took office.&quot; Figures from the agency that tracks federal vehicles indicate the number of limos is up. But the agency says its record keeping is such that it doesn&rsquo;t know how many limos there are, and won&rsquo;t be able to calculate any level of increase under Obama until January 2012.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tWe rate Neumann&rsquo;s statement Mostly False.&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-10T18:22:57.252657", "ruling_date": "2011-11-13T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "GOP Wisconsin Senate candidate Mark Neumann sees many more federal limos under Obama", "ruling_headline_slug": "gop-wisconsin-senate-candidate-mark-neumann-sees-m", "ruling_link_text": "Even feds don\u2019t know how many they have", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWISN-AM, Jay Weber Show <a href=\"http://media.ccomrcdn.com/media/station_content/1176/Hour_3_-_Part_2c_1320849750_9680.mp3\">Mark</a><a href=\"http://media.ccomrcdn.com/media/station_content/1176/Hour_3_-_Part_2c_1320849750_9680.mp3\"> Neumann interview</a>, Nov. 9, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJSOnline.com, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/133546383.html\">&quot;Neumann details his federal budget cuts,&quot;</a> Nov. 9, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact.com, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/27/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-claims-federal-limousines-73-perc/\">&quot;Michele Bachmann claims federal limousines up 73 percent under Obama,</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/27/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-claims-federal-limousines-73-perc/\">&quot;</a> June 27, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWISC-TV, <a href=\"http://www.channel3000.com/news/29730722/detail.html\">&quot;Neumann calls for federal budget cuts,&quot;</a> Nov. 9, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeneral Services Administration, limousines <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/FMRB-29+%282%29.pdf\">memo</a>, July 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, General Services Administration spokesman Gregory Mecher, Nov. 10, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Mark Neumann campaign spokesman Chris Lato, Nov. 10, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeneral Services Administration, <a href=\"http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/102943\">annual fleet reports</a> (Table 2-5)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.iwatchnews.org/about\">Center for Public Integrity</a>, <a href=\"http://www.iwatchnews.org/2011/05/31/4765/limousine-liberals-number-government-owned-limos-has-soared-under-obama\">&quot;Limousine liberals?
