Barack Obama is right on the general point, calling the practice &quot;the biggest tax scam on record&quot; is questionable. From the quote itself, it&#39;s hard to tell if Obama is taking issue with the way companies use the Caymans as a tax shelter, or if he&#39;s objecting to the U.S. tax code that makes it possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&#39;s nothing better than to beat up on a tax haven on a beach,&quot; said Douglas Shackelford, a professor at the University of North Carolina&#39;s business school. &quot;It sounds crooked, but if one really thinks about the facts, I don&#39;t see the grounding.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weather isn&#39;t drawing the corporations, of course. The Caymans do not have a corporate income tax. The United States taxes corporate income at 35 percent, higher than most countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as profits are not brought back to the United States, or &quot;repatriated,&quot; no tax is due. Federal law allows the taxation of &quot;passive income,&quot; meaning the interest earned on profits of those subsidiaries. But typically the companies reinvest the money elsewhere, Shackelford said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama is the co-sponsor of legislation that would crack down on offshore activities by corporations and individuals. The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act would target an estimated $100-billion annually, including $30-billion from corporations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to published financial reports, Coca-Cola alone saved $500-million in U.S. taxes in 2003 through foreign subsidiaries. Its Cayman company controls syrup-producing facilities in Ireland. The subsidiary pays taxes in Ireland at 12.5 percent, still far less than in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Obama is right that thousands of corporations, and some do say more than 12,000, are in one building in the Caymans, but he goes too far when he implies it&#39;s an illegal scam. We rule his statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:27.278796", "ruling_date": "2008-01-09T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Yes, but it's not illegal", "ruling_headline_slug": "yes-but-its-not-illegal", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, but it's not illegal", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>United States General Accounting Office, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/~levin/newsroom/supporting/2004/030404taxhavenGAOreport.pdf\"> International Taxation: Information on federal contractors with offshore subsidiaries,&quot; </a> February 2004</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Press release, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/~levin/newsroom/release.cfm?id=269479\"> Levin, Coleman, Obama Introduce Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act </a> , Feb. 17, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg Markets, <a href=\"http://www.law.wayne.edu/mcintyre/text/in_the_news/David_Evans_offshore.pdf\"> The $150-billion shell game, </a> by David Evans, August 2004</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/business/yourmoney/01cay.html?n=Top/News/World/Countries%20and%20Territories/Cayman%20Islands&amp;pagewanted=all\"> Offshore Tax Breaks Lure Money Managers, </a> by Lynnley Browning, July 1, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Los Angeles, Times, &quot;Trouble coming for Cayman tax paradise?&quot; by Carol J.
