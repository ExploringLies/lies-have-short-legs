After a panel of editors reconsidered the rating, it was upgraded to Mostly True.</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Republican Jewish Coalition -- a group backed by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and a few other wealthy GOP donors -- has opened a campaign in battleground states to persuade Jewish voters to turn away from President Obama and support Mitt Romney.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group said its effort, called &quot;My Buyer&rsquo;s Remorse,&quot; includes a $5 million television ad buy in Ohio (specifically Cleveland), South Florida, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia) and Nevada (Las Vegas) that will continue through Nov. 5.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt also includes a direct-mail brochure to voters saying Obama is &quot;wrong on Israel, wrong on our economy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst among the statements answering its question &quot;Why is Barack Obama wrong for us?&quot; is that he &quot;refuses to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGiven that the flier is showing up mailboxes in the battleground Buckeye State, PolitiFact Ohio thought it was worth looking into the coalition&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made a similar claim in a 30-second TV ad that aired in early August 2012. PolitiFact national looked at his claim then. We&rsquo;ve incorporated some of that research here.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe United States does not formally recognize any state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. In the decades-long conflict between Jews and Palestinians, both sides stake a claim on Jerusalem and consider it their capital and a holy site. So even though Jerusalem is the Israeli seat of government and its capital city in every traditional sense, the official position often involves some tip-toeing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe CIA, on its World Factbook website, lists Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, with a footnote stating &quot;Israel proclaimed Jerusalem as its capital in 1950, but the U.S., like all other countries, maintains its Embassy in Tel Aviv.&quot; The U.S. Department of State posts similar language.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring the 2008 campaign, candidate Obama declared that &quot;Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe remark pleased the pro-Israel lobby, which had been somewhat skeptical of him. But it also served as an early lesson in the delicacy of diplomacy, particularly when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Arab groups took offense, and the campaign had to do some damage control. &quot;It&#39;s going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues. And Jerusalem will be part of those negotiations,&quot; Obama said in the wake.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor his part, Republican rival John McCain weighed in, agreeing &quot;Jerusalem is undivided. Jerusalem is the capital.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;And,&quot; he added, according to the New York Times, &quot;we should move our embassy to Jerusalem,&quot; from Tel Aviv, &quot;before anything else happens. The subject of Jerusalem itself will be addressed in negotiations by the Israeli government and people.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTherein lies a long-running point of contention: the location of the U.S. embassy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs our peers at the Washington Post&rsquo;s Fact Checker column noted, the Republican Party platform has long included a pledge to move the embassy to Jerusalem. But that&rsquo;s never happened, even when a Republican was in the White House.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow wide is the gap between campaign rhetoric and official policy? During a press briefing on July 26, 2012, White House spokesman Jay Carney twice dodged the question when asked directly to name the capital of Israel.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe replied only that &quot;our position hasn&rsquo;t changed&quot; and &quot;you know the answer.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland parried similarly at a briefing on March 29, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Jerusalem is a permanent-status issue,&quot; she said. &quot;It&rsquo;s got to be resolved through negotiations.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose briefings are the evidence the Republican Jewish Coalition pointed to when PolitiFact Ohio asked for backup to its brochure. Romney&rsquo;s campaign cited the Carney briefing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim in the RJC brochure is accurate. Obama has not formally acknowledged Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the claim needs additional information for clarification.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs a candidate, Obama identified Jerusalem as Israel&rsquo;s capital. But as president since then, he has shied away from making statements that could be perceived as taking sides in the ongoing peace process.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe&nbsp;RJC&#39;s&nbsp;brochure portrays that position as a betrayal of an ally. But it&#39;s a&nbsp;continuation of the position that previous presidents, both Democrat and Republican, have taken.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFormally, the United States does not recognize any state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. Both the state department and CIA note that Jerusalem as Israel&rsquo;s capital, with a footnote attached, on their websites.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-23T15:56:47.769146", "ruling_date": "2012-09-24T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Republican Jewish Coalition says Obama refuses to acknowledge Jerusalem as Israel's capital", "ruling_headline_slug": "republican-jewish-coalition-says-obama-refuses-ack", "ruling_link_text": "Position is consistent with longtime U.S. policy", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRepublican Jewish Coalition, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rjchq.org/2012/09/5-million-rjc-ad-buy-begins/\">$5 Million RJC Ad Buy Begins</a>,&quot;
