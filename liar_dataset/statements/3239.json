And if some of those jobs are lost in this, so be it. We&#39;re broke. It&#39;s time for us to get serious about how we&#39;re spending the nation&#39;s money.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA few readers asked us whether Boehner was right about the number of new federal jobs, so we checked into it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe turned, as we always do, to the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/ces/\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, the official statistician for the United States labor force.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBLS calculates two categories that illuminate Boehner&rsquo;s comment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first is the overall rise in federal employees between January 2009 and January 2011. The net increase was 58,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second is the number of federal employees without counting U.S. Postal Service workers. Over that same two-year period, the increase was 140,800.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth of those numbers are lower than the 200,000 figure Boehner cited.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also checked with John M. Palguta, vice president for policy with the Partnership for Public Service, a non-profit that promotes government service, and he confirmed our general conclusion using numbers from a different database.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe dug into the U.S. Office of Personnel Management&rsquo;s on-line federal workforce data source, &quot;FedScope.&quot; He found that in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, respectively, the federal government filled a net 59,995 and 47,062 new permanent, full-time, non-seasonal, non-postal jobs. Combined, that means that federal employment rose by 107,057 jobs -- well short of 200,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked with Boehner&rsquo;s office to see what his statement was based on. Aides said they had used figures from December 2008 to January 2011, which produced an increase of 153,000 federal, non-postal jobs. Then they factored in, on a discounted basis, the temporary jobs required to carry out the 2010 Census. <a href=\"http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/jobs/temp-workers.html\">According to the Census Bureau</a>, such temporary employment peaked at 585,729 in early May 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We think 200,000 is probably generous to the White House,&quot; said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/16/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-repeats-questionable-statistic-growth/\">previous</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2010/jul/15/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obama-has-presided-over-private-/\">fact checks</a>, we have rejected the idea of adding temporary Census workers to federal job totals. While the statements we rated previously aren&rsquo;t structured in exactly the same way as Boehner&rsquo;s, we think the general principle remains valid -- that when you&rsquo;re counting the rise or fall in the number of federal workers over a long period of time, it&rsquo;s cherry picking to count the creation of temporary jobs but not their elimination.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll told, we find that Boehner&rsquo;s 200,000 number is way off. We rate it False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-15T16:48:49.624932", "ruling_date": "2011-02-15T18:23:10", "ruling_headline": "John Boehner says 200,000 new federal jobs have sprouted since start of Obama's term", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-boehner-says-200000-new-federal-jobs-have-spr", "ruling_link_text": "It's an overestimate", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWashington Post, &quot;<a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/federal-eye/2011/02/john_boehner_if_federal_jobs_a.html\">John Boehner: If federal jobs are lost, &#39;So be it,&rsquo;</a>&quot; Feb. 15, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/ces/\">main search page for Current Employment Statistics</a>, accessed Feb. 15, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, &quot;<a href=\"http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/jobs/temp-workers.html\">Number of Temporary 2010 Census Workers Paid by Week and Census Region</a>,&quot; accessed Feb. 15, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with John M.
