In 1984, for example, the Democratic primary turned out about three times more voters than the Republican primary. Nonetheless, President Ronald Reagan won re-election with almost 60 percent of the popular vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the six elections where there were contests on both sides, the party with the higher primary voter turnout won the popular vote just three times. In 1976, 1992 and 2008, Democratic primary turnout surpassed that of the GOP nominating race, and the Democratic candidates won the general election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a chart showing this, compiled with data from the <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/electionresults.shtml\">Federal Election Commission</a> and <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/\">a</a> <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/02/01/how_much_does_voter_turnout_matter_112990.html\">few</a> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5A1lFQvBa-idHNaUks5Umo2d2M/edit\">other</a> <a href=\"http://www.ourcampaigns.com/\">sources</a>.

He pointed out that the Democrats, while not turning up at the primary polls in droves, are still highly engaged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Those numbers have got to be pleasing and there are good reasons why the Republicans will be able to leverage the turnout.
