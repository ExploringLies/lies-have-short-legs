She knows how to create jobs. Meg Whitman was the CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now&nbsp;&mdash; 1.3-million people in America make their living off eBay.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n That's way off. We hate to nitpick&nbsp;apparent misstatements, but this one's a doozy&nbsp;&mdash; 1.3-million is the number of people\n <em>\n  worldwide\n </em>\n who make\n <em>\n  some\n </em>\n money off eBay, according to a 2006 A.C. Nielsen study.\n</p>\n<p>\n As of 2003,&nbsp;some 20,000 Americans made their living off eBay, company executive Jim Griffith told a Colorado newspaper at the time.\n</p>\n<p>\n These days, the company only keeps track of eBay entrepreneurs worldwide, and doesn't distinguish between full time and part time online auctioneers, a representative&nbsp;told us.\n</p>\n<p>\n But it's not conceivable that the number of Americans making a living off eBay has climbed to 1.3-million. In 2005, the latest year for which statistics are available, just 724,000 Americans&nbsp;made money selling on eBay, according to a Nielsen study. But that includes many&nbsp;who made just a few bucks &ndash; not a living.\n</p>\n<p>\n We examined this issue\n <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/113/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  before\n </a>\n , when McCain said 50,000 Americans made their living off eBay. The company told us it didn't know where he got that number, but we gave him a Half True because we couldn't be certain he was wrong.\n</p>\n<p>\n This time, his number is more than a million higher, and not even conceivably true.
