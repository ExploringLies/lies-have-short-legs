The penalty is assessed on tax returns, and increases every year a person remains uninsured. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one is forced to buy government health insurance via the individual mandate, but individuals are strongly incentivized to have the minimum essential health coverage to avoid the penalty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some may consider the individual mandate to be &quot;forcing&quot; people to get coverage, but people can choose to remain without health insurance and defer to the fine, said Ben Sommers, an assistant professor of health and economics at the Harvard T.H. School of Public Health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beruff&rsquo;s point isn&rsquo;t flat-out wrong, but his word choice is problematic, said Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush. She said she wouldn&rsquo;t have used the word &quot;forced&quot; because the mandate only strongly encourages having health care coverage, and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be government coverage if your employer offers private insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The individual mandate has many <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/health-coverage-exemptions/forms-how-to-apply/\">exemptions</a> depending on income, membership in groups like Indian tribes, and incarceration. If individuals don&rsquo;t fall into those categories, the <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/health-coverage-exemptions/hardship-exemptions/\">Health Insurance Marketplace</a> lays out 14 categories of hardship exemptions that exempt people from the financial penalty if they cannot afford it. &quot;Hardship&quot; exemptions cover homelessness, filing for bankruptcy and foreclosure, and a family member&rsquo;s death, to name a few examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dissecting &lsquo;government health care&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beruff&rsquo;s bigger problem is with his characterization of the Affordable Care Act as &quot;government health care.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, the mandate requires Americans to carry health insurance. But just as before the law, the majority obtain it from private sources, such as their employer or from choosing plans offered in health insurance marketplaces set up by federal or state regulators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law aimed to dramatically expand public health insurance through the federal-state Medicaid program. But a Supreme Court decision has allowed<a href=\"http://kff.org/medicaid/fact-sheet/where-are-states-today-medicaid-and-chip/\"> 20 states</a>, including large ones such as Texas and Florida, to not extend coverage to more low-income residents using federal dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, 66 percent of people had private health insurance, and 55 percent of all people received insurance from their employers, according to <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/library/publications/2015/demo/p60-253.html\">a report from the Census Bureau</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any type of private health insurance must meet specific set of rules in the <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/essential-health-benefits/\">essential benefit package</a>, said Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. But it&rsquo;s still private, not government health care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Tanner said it might be fair to call the coverage &quot;government designated health care&quot; because individuals can&rsquo;t buy just any type of health insurance, he said. Beruff&rsquo;s spokesperson echoed this argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beruff said Washington politicians are &quot;already forcing you to buy government health care.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His statement makes a sweeping generalization, but there is some truth to the &quot;forcing&quot; part.&nbsp;The individual mandate incentivizes individuals to have health care or face a tax penalty.&nbsp;Of course,&nbsp;the choice is still theirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bigger problem is Beruff&rsquo;s use of &quot;government health care.&quot; This talking point was flawed around the law&rsquo;s passage six years ago, and it&rsquo;s no more accurate now. Just as before, the country&rsquo;s health care system largely depends on the free market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly&nbsp;False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7b94aa27-a11f-4e36-84db-354ba5d567b8\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7b94aa27-a11f-4e36-84db-354ba5d567b8</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-11T17:03:27.640421", "ruling_date": "2016-07-12T10:33:00", "ruling_headline": "No, you're still not being forced 'to buy government health care'", "ruling_headline_slug": "are-you-being-forced-government-health-care-nope", "ruling_link_text": "Word choice is problematic", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview, Ben Sommers, Assistant Professor of Health Policy &amp; Economics at the Harvard T.H.
