A curious reader forwarded a chain e-mail that made an interesting claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Pakistan was on the U.S. State Department&#39;s &#39;no travel&#39; list in 1981,&quot; read the e-mail. Therefore, &quot;when Obama went to Pakistan in 1981 he was traveling either with a British passport or an Indonesian passport.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe most effective chain e-mails, like the best lies, are built on an incorrect but seemingly plausible &quot;fact&quot; that they follow to what seems like a sound conclusion. In this case, the &quot;fact&quot; on which the entire argument rests is that Pakistan was on a &quot;no travel&quot; list in 1981. If that were true, Obama would either have had to use a different passport or enter the country illegally and request his passport not be stamped, as some Americans have done over the years to travel to Cuba.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama has said he traveled to Pakistan in 1981. He was on summer vacation from college, and, after visiting his mother in Indonesia, he traveled to Pakistan with a college friend. However, according to the U.S. Department of State, the department in charge of issuing travel bans, Pakistan had a green light for adventurous U.S. citzens.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;According to our Pakistan experts,&quot; said Ivna Giauque, a public affairs officer at the State Department, &quot;there was no travel ban to Pakistan in 1981.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWithout the original premise that Pakistan had a travel ban, the rest of the argument deteriorates. The author of the e-mail may have been confusing a travel warning or travel advisory with a travel ban. The University of Illinois at Chicago Library has an archive of State Department documents, including one from Aug. 17, 1981, issuing a travel advisory for Pakistan. It is the oldest travel advisory document in the archive related to Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEven if Obama traveled after the advisory was issued instead of earlier in the summer, the State Department confirmed it wasn&#39;t illegal. Our good friends at Snopes and Factcheck.org found a travel article about visiting Pakistan published in the <em>New York Times</em> in June 1981, and it mentions nothing about such travel being illegal. An August 1981 letter to the editor in the <em>New York Times</em> by the U.S. Consul General in Lahore, Pakistan, encouraged people to come visit. We also found an ad in the <em>New York Times</em> from March which listed Karachi and Lahore as two destinations in their travel package.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1981, travel to Pakistan was not illegal or prohibited. Somebody was just looking for an excuse to promote the birther conspiracy, so we rate it Pants On Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-28T22:37:56.655435", "ruling_date": "2010-07-30T14:25:39", "ruling_headline": "E-mail says Obama had to have been traveling on another country's passport to get into Pakistan ", "ruling_headline_slug": "e-mail-says-obama-had-have-been-traveling-another-", "ruling_link_text": "No facts were harmed in the writing of this e-mail", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tE-mail Interview with Ivna Giauque, Public Affairs Officer at U.S. Department of State, June 14, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJake Tapper, <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/04/obamas-college.html\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Obama&#39;s College Trip to Pakistan,&quot;</a> ABC News, April 08, 2008.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFactcheck.org, <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2009/06/more-birther-nonsense-obamas-1981-pakistan-trip/\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;More &#39;Birther&#39; Nonsense: Obama&#39;s 1981 Pakistan Trip,&quot;</a> June 5, 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSnopes.com, <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/passport.asp\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Passport of Call,&quot;</a> July 14, 2009.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBarbara Crossette, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/14/travel/lahore-a-survivor-with-a-bittersweet-history.html?scp=1&amp;sq=lahore%20travel%201981&amp;st=cse\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lahore, A Survivor with a Bittersweet History,\">Lahore, A Survivor with a Bittersweet History,</a>&quot; NY Times, June 14, 1981.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJohn Brims, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/23/travel/l-lahore-243000.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=lahore%20travel%201981&amp;st=cse\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lahore,\">Lahore,</a>&quot; NY Times, August 23, 1981.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBureau of Consular Affairs, &quot;<a href=\"http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/travel/cis/southasia/TA_Pakistan1981.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Travel Advisory to Pakistan\">Travel Advisory to Pakistan</a>,&quot; University of Illinois at Chicago Library, August 17, 1981.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Fake_news", "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "", "false_count": 44, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "", "id": 27, "last_name": "Chain email", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "chain-email", "pants_count": 106, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-emailer.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/27/", "total_count": 180, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tWhen Obama went to Pakistan in 1981, he could not have been traveling as a U.S. citizen.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a chain e-mail.", "statement_date": "2010-06-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 167, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/167/", "subject": "Obama Birth Certificate", "subject_slug": "obama-birth-certificate", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": "Chain e-mail on Obama in Pakistan gets Pants on Fire"}
