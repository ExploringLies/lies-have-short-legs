This week, <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/06/portland_mayor_sam_adams_propo_2.html\">Portland Mayor Sam Adams shot back with a ginormous fee </a>increase on TriMet benches and shelters so he can provide the free passes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe YouthPass program is a big deal to Adams, who says transit access is critical to keeping teenagers in school and connected. In a statement released Tuesday, <a href=\"http://www.portlandonline.com/mayor/index.cfm?c=49520&amp;a=402419\">the mayor argued that providing passes for roughly 13,000 Portland Public Schools high school students </a>doesn&rsquo;t add to the transit agency&rsquo;s operating costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In fact, TriMet&#39;s own analysis shows that YouthPass does not actually add to the transit agency&#39;s costs. No new buses, MAX trips, additional routes or drivers are needed to accommodate YouthPass riders,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTriMet&rsquo;s own analysis showed that? This we had to check.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Oregon contacted Caryn Brooks, the mayor&rsquo;s spokeswoman. She turned up an Oct. 25, 2011 memo from an ECONorthwest economist to Claire Potter, TriMet&rsquo;s director of financial analysis. The memo, commissioned by TriMet, explains the economic impact to the transit agency should it provide the passes without state support.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome quick background: Portland Public Schools has long provided free transit passes for low-income students. The concept was expanded under Adams in fall 2009 to include all PPS students. The state of Oregon paid for most of the $3.4 million program through a business energy tax credit; Portland Public Schools paid $800,000 of that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe arrangement ended in December 2011, at which point the City of <a href=\"http://www.portlandonline.com/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=376852\">Portland, Portland Public Schools and TriMet </a>cobbled a plan to keep it running through the school year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the part of the ECONorthwest report that the mayor highlights: &quot;The provision of free passes to PPS students likely did not affect TriMet&#39;s operating costs in a significant way. Discontinuing the provision of free passes is unlikely to result in operating cost savings.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn other words: The report states the agency saves no money if it stops providing free rides. Adams is correct about that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the analysis also shows that TriMet loses out on a potential $1.9 million in fare money from students in 2012-13. And that&rsquo;s based on a monthly pass price tag of $27, wrote TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch in an email. The price is scheduled to increase to $30 a month in September. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe &quot;additional cost is not what TriMet is concerned about -- it is the foregone passenger revenue, in the range of $2 million,&quot; Fetsch said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe&rsquo;s right that the analysis is about the potential hit to TriMet&rsquo;s revenue stream. And Adams knows that, because he&rsquo;s proposed an 8000 percent increase in shelter and bench fees to squeeze $2 million out of TriMet, which he would then use to reimburse TriMet for the cost of the student passes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe mayor&rsquo;s statement is accurate. But we think it needs additional information. Providing free student passes will not add to TriMet&rsquo;s operating costs in the form of more drivers or bus routes, but it will deprive the transit agency of revenue once provided by other public agencies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statement is accurate but needs extra information. We rate his statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-27T20:56:07.470140", "ruling_date": "2012-06-27T17:55:27", "ruling_headline": "Does TriMet itself say that free rides for high school students do not add to operating costs?
