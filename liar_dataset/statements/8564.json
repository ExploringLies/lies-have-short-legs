I&#39;m concerned that the state budget has actually grown by $4.6 billion under this administration, which makes it harder and harder to keep taxes lower.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You would think Burke&rsquo;s figure, which she repeated in a Madison speech on Nov. 20, 2013, could be checked with a simple comparison of two numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you&rsquo;d be like the guy who proposes to his girlfriend while slipping a ring on her right hand:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well-intentioned, but a little misguided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Burke&rsquo;s numbers </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burke&rsquo;s phrasing could be taken to mean she was claiming the two-year state budget has grown $4.6 billion since Walker succeeded Democrat Jim Doyle in January 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or that it has grown by that amount at some point during Walker&#39;s tenure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, even Burke&#39;s own campaign wasn&#39;t clear on what she meant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked spokesman Joe Zepecki for evidence to back Burke&rsquo;s claim, he compared the size of Walker&rsquo;s first budget, for 2011-&rsquo;13, to Walker&rsquo;s second budget, for 2013-&rsquo;15. He provided a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/22/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsin-broke-and-3-billio/\"><u>PolitiFact Wisconsin article</u></a>, which made reference to the first budget being $66 billion; and a reference by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, which <a href=\"http://wistax.org/publication/window-on-the-wisconsin-state-budget\"><u>said</u></a> the second budget &quot;authorizes the state to spend&quot; $70.4 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the two figures are apples and oranges: the $66 billion figure for 2011-&rsquo;13 was for the general fund budget -- operations funded with state revenue; the $70.4 billion for 2013-&rsquo;15 is an &quot;all funds&quot; figure that includes federal funding as well as $2 billion in borrowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zepecki then said his staff had made a mistake and that Burke&rsquo;s statement actually compared Walker&#39;s current budget to Doyle&#39;s final budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zepecki cited figures from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau showing an increase of $4.6 billion, from <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/budget/2009-11-Budget/Documents/Act%2028/table1.pdf\"><u>$65.8 billion</u></a> in 2009-&rsquo;11 to <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/budget/2013-15%20Budget/Documents/Joint%20Finance/table1.pdf\"><u>$70.4 billion</u></a> in 2013-&rsquo;15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But both of those figures are &quot;all funds&quot; appropriations -- not the general fund budget, which comes from state tax dollars and typically is the focus of lawmakers, the news media and others when talking about the state budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s review some other numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We put Burke&rsquo;s claim to Robert Lang, director of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state agency in charge of scoring budgets and other money matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lang said that looking strictly at biennial general fund budgets -- the ones funded with state revenue -- Doyle&rsquo;s final spending plan for 2009-&rsquo;11 was $62.19 billion and Walker&rsquo;s current budget, for 2013-&rsquo;15, is $67.5 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s an increase of $5.31 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lang also said that whenever his agency is asked to compare biennial spending, it considers not only the budget itself, but any other legislation that becomes law during the two-year period. For example, a $100 million property tax relief law approved under Walker after the 2013-&rsquo;15 budget was adopted would be tallied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using that method, Doyle&rsquo;s final spend was $62.95 billion and Walker&rsquo;s spend in the current biennium -- as of Nov. 15, 2013 -- is $67.62 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An increase of $4.67 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, by the two official figures, Burke&rsquo;s number claim is on target, or even conservative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about the rest of her statement, that Walker is responsible for the growth in the budget?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Perspective</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The growth in Walker&rsquo;s first budget was driven largely by increased expenditures on Medicaid; in his second budget, the increases were in large part for Medicaid and school aids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&#39;s press secretary, Tom Evenson, contended the increase since Walker took office is $4.4 billion -- slightly less than Burke&rsquo;s $4.6 billion claim -- but said it is misleading to say Walker decided to increase spending by that amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These are commitments the state cannot easily back out of and stem from decisions largely made prior to Gov. Walker taking office,&quot; Evenson said of the federal- and state-funded Medicaid program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medicaid costs are driven by many factors, from how many people are eligible for the program to the cost of treatment and what recipients are asked to contribute in co-pays. That&#39;s much different than a governor simply deciding to boost spending on various programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the highlights of Walker&rsquo;s first budget included a nearly $800 million cut from public schools, tax cuts for investors and businesses, and clamp-down on property taxes. His second budget included a $651 million income tax decrease, a two-year university tuition for freeze and an increase in property taxes on the typical home limited to 1% in each of the two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burke said the state budget &quot;has actually grown by $4.6 billion under&quot; Walker&rsquo;s administration, suggesting Walker had boosted the spending. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The figure is accurate, but it is due almost completely to Medicaid costs, not budget decisions Walker made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, we give Burke a Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-18T14:39:31.226514", "ruling_date": "2013-11-24T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Democratic challenger to Scott Walker says state budget has grown $4.6 billion during his tenure", "ruling_headline_slug": "democratic-challenger-gov-scott-walker-says-state-", "ruling_link_text": "Figure right; blame misleading", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, WISC-TV <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IozYYtbpRDc\"><u>interview</u></a> of Mary Burke (quote at 3:00), Nov. 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/informational-papers/documents/2013/74_state%20budget%20process.pdf\"><u>&quot;State budget process,&quot;</u></a> January 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-makes-57-vetoes-signs-68-billion-wisconsin-budget-b9944038z1-213757881.html?ipad=y.%20\"><u>&quot;Scott Walker issues 57 vetoes, signs $68 billion Wisconsin budget,&quot;</u></a> June 20, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Journal, <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2013/06/30/gov-scott-walker-signs-70-billion.html?page=all\"><u>&quot;Gov.
