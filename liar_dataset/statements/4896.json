Claiming that Washington&rsquo;s energy policies could leave Ohio families in the cold this winter, it says: &quot;When Sherrod Brown had the chance to help cut energy costs, he said no. Instead, Brown voted to block American energy production and increase energy taxes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOver the Thanksgiving weekend, the group substituted <a href=\"http://bcove.me/lybc73f1\">a second ad</a> with an illustration of Brown peeking through window blinds as an announcer suggests he&rsquo;s &quot;hiding from his tax-raising, job killing record.&quot; It goes onto assert that Brown &quot;supports raising energy taxes.&quot; It also faults his votes for last year&rsquo;s health care reform law. Both ads tell voters to call Brown&rsquo;s office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChamber spokesman J.P. Fielder says Brown is being targeted because his 9 percent level of support for <a href=\"http://www.uschamber.com/issues/legislators/how-they-voted-2010-senate\">U.S. Chamber voting positions</a> is among the U.S. Senate&rsquo;s lowest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;With the economy in the state it is in, and notably, the way the economy is in Ohio, we think it is all the more important to highlight for voters where candidates stand on business issues,&quot; Fielder said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince energy was sole topic of the Chamber&rsquo;s first ad and a key point of its second one, PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. We&rsquo;re focusing on the group&rsquo;s claim in the first ad that Brown voted to block American energy production and increase energy taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe chamber cited votes that Brown made on <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00072\">May 17</a> and <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00073\">May 18</a> of this year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne of those votes was on a measure that would have eliminated $12 billion in tax breaks to big oil companies over 10 years as a way to reduce the budget deficit. It targeted five companies: Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, Conoco Phillips, and BP.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublicans, like Alaska&rsquo;s Lisa Murkowski, <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-05-17/pdf/CREC-2011-05-17-pt1-PgS3013-4.pdf#page=4\">argued its passage would increase gasoline costs and reduce domestic oil production</a>. Democrats, like California&rsquo;s Barbara Boxer, contended the measure would not raise consumer prices because the oil companies are flush enough with profits to forsake such &quot;corporate welfare.&quot; Despite Brown&rsquo;s backing, It failed to get enough votes to warrant Senate consideration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.953:\">The second measure</a> - which also failed to get enough votes to warrant full U.S. Senate consideration - would have expanded offshore oil and gas drilling. Brown opposed bringing it to the Senate floor. Republicans, like Utah&rsquo;s Orrin Hatch, <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-05-18/pdf/CREC-2011-05-18-pt1-PgS3069-2.pdf#page=1\">predicted the measure would reduce energy prices and the nation&rsquo;s reliance on foreign oil</a>. Democrats, like Robert Menendez of New Jersey, said the plan would cut oil prices by a mere three cents a gallon in 20 years while risking spill damage on the nation&rsquo;s coasts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/19/john-mccain/no-relief-at-pump-here-and-now/\">PolitiFact previously has found</a> that new domestic drilling won&rsquo;t have much impact on oil prices much because of the many years it would take to realize production gains and because any contribution to the global oil market would be too small to significantly shrink prices.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFielder said the claim that Brown supports raising energy taxes, which is made in each ad, also is derived from a third vote he cast. Brown opposed an <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00135\">April 2009 budgetary amendment</a> that would raise a parliamentary <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/point_of_order.htm\">point of order</a> against any legislation that would impose a national energy tax on individual taxpayers who make $200,000 or less, or couples with a top income of $250,000. According to the U.S. Senate website, a point of order is &quot;a claim made by a Senator from the floor that a rule of the Senate is being violated. If the chair sustains the point of order, the action in violation of the rule is not permitted.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown spokeswoman Meghan Dubyak said the measure Brown voted against &quot;wouldn&rsquo;t affect energy taxes by one dime&quot; because it was a procedural amendment to prevent any Congressional debate over energy issues.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhere does that leave the Chamber&rsquo;s allegation that &quot;Brown voted to block American energy production and increase energy taxes&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere is an element of truth in the claim. Brown&rsquo;s vote to repeal tax breaks to big oil companies could be deemed a vote to &quot;increase energy taxes.&quot; But those taxes would be on big oil companies - not the Ohioans whom the ad says &quot;need economic help, not higher energy taxes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact has noted in previous items that the assertion that Brown&rsquo;s opposition to the offshore drilling measure was &quot;a chance to help cut energy costs&quot; is dubious, since the consumer price impact of offshore drilling would be minimal and in the far future.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the Chamber argues that &nbsp;Brown&rsquo;s opposition to establishing a parliamentary &quot;point of order&quot; against debating energy tax legislation means that he &quot;supports raising energy taxes.&quot; &nbsp;But that&rsquo;s not what that vote was about.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis vote indicates that he wouldn&rsquo;t bar discussion of such ideas, not that he supports them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the U.S. Chamber of Commerce&rsquo;s claim Mostly False.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2011/12/us_chamber_of_commerce_targets.html\" target=\"blank\">Comment on this item</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-12-05T18:59:55.013532", "ruling_date": "2011-12-06T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Chamber of Commerce targets Sherrod Brown votes on energy, taxes", "ruling_headline_slug": "us-chamber-commerce-targets-sherrod-brown-votes-en", "ruling_link_text": "High-octane attacks fueled by distorted claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tU.S. Chamber of Commerce news release, <a href=\"http://www.uschamber.com/press/releases/2011/november/us-chamber-launches-six-state-effort-educate-voters-important-issues-af\">U.S. Chamber launches six-state effort to educate voters on important issues affecting the economy</a>, Nov. 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLos Angeles Times, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-business-ads-2012-20111116,0,3404329,print.story\">Chamber of Commerce getting early start with attack ads</a>, Nov. 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Chamber of Commerce YouTube channel, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/USCC#p/a/1EA11AA9D9F1A2C0/2/d5spIYD6udQ\">Sherrod Brown Supports Higher Energy Taxes in Ohio</a>, &nbsp;Nov. 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFriends of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, <a href=\"http://www.friendsoftheuschamber.com/video/stop-hiding-ohio-senate\">Stop Hiding: Ohio Senate,</a> accessed Nov. 29, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews and emails with U.S. Chamber of Commerce spokespeople Blair Latoff and J.P.
