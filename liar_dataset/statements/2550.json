Blue Oregon, a liberal political website, is accusing one Republican candidate of trying to take health care away from 80,000 of Oregon&rsquo;s youth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a <a href=\"http://www.blueoregon.com/2010/09/lets-help-few-oregon-progressive-candidates-earn-extra-50000/\">post</a>looking for political contributions, Kari Chisholm of Blue Oregon describes the race in House District 24 as follows: &quot;Susan Sokol Blosser (the Democrat) is one of the founders of Oregon&#39;s world-renowned wine industry where she&rsquo;s a leader on environmental sustainability. Her opponent, <a href=\"http://gov.oregonlive.com/legislators/Jim-Weidner/\">Rep. Jim </a><a href=\"http://gov.oregonlive.com/legislators/Jim-Weidner/\">Weidner</a>proposed a bill taking away health care for 80,000 of Oregon&#39;s children.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOuch. Not exactly the sort of thing that wins you votes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNaturally, PolitiFact Oregon wondered if Weidner, who has four kids himself, really has it out for Oregon&rsquo;s children.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim on Blue Oregon was in reference to <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.or.us/10ss1/measures/hb3600.dir/hb3603.intro.html\">House Bill 3603</a>, a bill that Weidner sponsored during the February 2010 special session. The bill, according to the summary, &quot;repeals (the) health insurance premium assessment.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat was nice and vague, so we did some more sleuthing and ended up with the staff measure summary for <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.or.us/09reg/measures/hb2100.dir/hb2116.en.html\">House Bill 2116</a>. Why House Bill 2116? Well, that was the bill that, in part, instituted the &quot;health insurance premium assessment&quot; or, to put it comprehensible English, a 1 percent tax on health insurance premiums paid by the insurance companies but passed on to the customers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.or.us/comm/sms/SMS09Frameset.html\">staff measure summary</a>, that 1 percent tax would be used to provide funding for health care for 80,000 children during the 2009-2011 biennium through Oregon Healthy Kids. Those 80,000 were in addition to the the children already covered by the state-run plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, it seems, Weidner does want to eliminate a tax that is being used to provide health care to children. We checked in with Weidner to see if he could explain his position. As it turns out, he&rsquo;s not so much against health care for children as he is against the 1 percent tax. He says the tax disproportionately hurts small businesses. Weidner sponsored the bill, he says, because he wanted to bring attention to this and other issues. &quot;I knew the bill wasn&rsquo;t going to go anywhere.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBefore we settled on a ruling we wanted to check one other thing: Even if Weidner&rsquo;s bill had gone through, are there really 80,000 children who would lose health insurance? We called Oregon Healthy Kids to find out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs it happens, since the bill passed, about 57,000 children have been enrolled in the program, according to Cathy Kaufmann, manager of the Healthy Kids Office. That&rsquo;s as of August. Kaufmann expects that the full 80,000 will be enrolled before the end of the 2009-2011 biennium.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo where does that leave us? Well, while we&rsquo;re feeling pretty confident that Weidner isn&rsquo;t anti-health care for kids, he did, as the website alleges, propose a bill that would have eliminated the funding for health care for 80,000 children. Whether he thought it would pass or not doesn&rsquo;t much change things. And some context about how he was really targeting a tax would have been nice. &nbsp;Still, we rate this claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-07T18:46:59.074570", "ruling_date": "2010-10-08T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Liberal website says Rep.
