I think every piece of legislation, just about, that I ever introduced had a Republican co-sponsor,&quot; she said at a campaign organizing event in Toledo, a small town between Des Moines and Cedar Rapids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, which is in Iowa this week covering the caucuses, wanted to see if Clinton had that right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We used <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=300022#current_status[]=2&amp;sort=-current_status_date\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>GovTrack.us</u></a> to see any Republican senator who co-sponsored a bill by Clinton. Of the 355 bills she sponsored that were referred to a Senate committee, Republicans were listed as a co-sponsor 241 times. That means, in theory, up to 68 percent of Clinton&rsquo;s bills could contain a Republican co-sponsor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the real percentage is likely much lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, for instance, co-sponsored six pieces of Clinton legislation. Four of those pieces of legislation had 10 or more Republican co-sponsors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also did a spot check of Clinton&rsquo;s record by looking at legislation directly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Congress.gov </u></a>is the official website for U.S. federal legislative information. It says that Clinton sponsored <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/member/hillary-clinton/C001041?q=%7B%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%7D&amp;page=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>703 pieces</u></a> of legislation while representing New York. They include bills, amendments and resolutions. We sorted the list by &quot;Latest Action - Newest to Oldest&quot; and then spot-checked every 10th bill, starting with the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/senate-bill/182\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Paycheck Fairness Act</u></a>, to see which ones had at least one Republican sponsor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From that list, we focused on the 44 pieces of legislation that were introduced, the term Clinton used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found at least one Republican co-sponsor in 4 of 7 resolutions or continuing resolutions (57 percent) but only 9 of 37 bills (24 percent).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, that&#39;s 13 out of 44, or just under 30 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focusing on the 18 bills that Clinton sponsored and brought to the Senate floor for consideration, four had at least one Republican co-sponsor (22 percent):</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&bull;&nbsp;A bill commemorating the 225th Anniversary of the American Revolution Commemoration Act (two GOP co-sponsors);</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&bull;&nbsp;A bill dealing with respite care (four GOP co-sponsors);</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&bull;&nbsp;A bill concerning the labeling of pediatric medication (two GOP co-sponsors);</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\">&bull;&nbsp;A bill seeking to assist the victims of landmines (four GOP co-sponsors).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So neither metric supports Clinton&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of this is to say she didn&rsquo;t work with Republicans during her time in the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if someone says, as Clinton did, that &quot;Just about every piece of legislation I introduced had a Republican co-sponsor,&quot; we think most listeners would expect better than 30 percent of the legislation introduced by Clinton would include a GOP co-sponsor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we heard back from the Clinton campaign, spokesman Josh Schwerin said, &quot;She meant to say, &nbsp;&#39;Just about every Republican senator I served with co-sponsored a piece of legislation I introduced.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In total, 57 (Republican) colleagues cosponsored at least one piece while only 8 did not,&quot; he reported in an email, and Schwerin supplied a list of 42 pieces of legislation to support that assertion.
