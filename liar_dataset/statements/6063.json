Bob McDonnell -- who spent 21 years in the U.S. Army and Reserves and is the son of career Army officer -- is proud to talk about the large military bases in Virginia and the current and past service of many who live here.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Memorial Day, he addressed 2,000 at the Virginia War Memorial in Richmond. His speech, on the cost of freedom, included the claim that Virginia &quot;is home to more veterans per capita than any state in America.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor has made that statement several times and we wondered if he were correct. So we checked the <a href=\"http://www.va.gov/vetdata/Veteran_Population.asp\">state veteran counts</a> listed on website of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which are from 2010, and compared them to <a href=\"http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/index.php\">state population tallies</a> in the 2010 Census.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe VA calculated there were 22.7 million veterans in the U.S. They made up 7.3 percent of the nation&rsquo;s 308.7 million people.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVirginia had about 822,300 veterans in 2010 and a census of 8,001,024 people. Veterans made up 10.28 percent of Old Dominion&rsquo;s population.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut three states topped Virginia&rsquo;s veteran population per capita:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t*Alaska had a 10.84 percent veteran population. It had an estimated 77,000 veterans and a population of 721,523.<br />\r\n\t*Maine had a 10.43 percent veteran population. It had an estimated 138,600 veterans and a population of 1,333,074.<br />\r\n\t*Montana had a 10.31 percent veteran population. It had an estimated 102,000 veterans and a population of 989,415.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked McDonnell&rsquo;s office for the governor&rsquo;s numbers and got a tally that was similar to ours. It was based on a 2011 VA estimate of veterans and the Census&rsquo; 2011 <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/asrh/2011/SC-EST2011-03.html\">population estimate</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder that data, Virginia ranked third, with 10.17 percent of the population formerly in military uniform. The leader was once again Alaska, with a 10.7 percent population of veterans, followed by Maine, at 10.27 percent. Montana slipped to No. 4, at 10.11 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGubernatorial spokesman Jeff Caldwell said McDonnell meant to say Virginia is &quot;one of&quot; the states with the highest per capita veteran populations and made a mistake while speaking extemporaneously.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor made the same mistake on May 29, the day after Memorial Day, during his <a href=\"http://media.dev-cms.com/wtop/24/2474/247463.mp3\">monthly broadcast</a> on WTOP radio in Washington. With little effort, we found two other occasions where he made the erroneous claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn case you&rsquo;re wondering, Virginia has the seventh largest veteran population in the nation, according to the VA. Here&rsquo;s a list of the top seven and their estimated 2011 veteran populations: California, 1,918,073; Texas, 1,683,237; Florida, 1,617,248; Pennsylvania, 933,404; New York, 913,489; Ohio, 867,240; Virginia, 823,348.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcDonnell&rsquo;s office acknowledges the governor erred on Memorial Day when he said Virginia has the most veterans per capita of any state. Virginia was No. 4 in 2010 and moved up to No. 3 in 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the governor&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-08T16:50:42.994921", "ruling_date": "2012-06-11T13:35:46", "ruling_headline": "Bob McDonnell says Virginia is No. 1 state in veterans per capita ", "ruling_headline_slug": "bob-mcdonnell-no-1-state-veterans-capita", "ruling_link_text": "Virginia ranks third", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRichmond Times-Dispatch, &quot;Military sacrifice honored,&quot; May 29, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, <a href=\"http://www.va.gov/vetdata/Veteran_Population.asp\">Veteran population</a> as of Sept. 30, 2010, accessed June 6, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/index.php\">2010 Census Data</a>, accessed June 6, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail from Jeff Caldwell, including 2011 table, June 1, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, The States spreadsheet, accessed June 6, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/asrh/2011/SC-EST2011-03.html\">2011 population estimates</a>, accessed June 6, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWTOP radio, &quot;<a href=\"http://media.dev-cms.com/wtop/24/2474/247463.mp3\">Ask the Governor</a>,&quot; May 29, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWCVE-FM, &quot;<a href=\"http://ideastations.org/radio/archive/2010-04-30-mcdonnell-signs-veterans-rights-bills\">McDonnell signs veterans rights bills</a>,&quot; April 30, 2010.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "Governor", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Bob", "half_true_count": 7, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 308, "last_name": "McDonnell", "mostly_true_count": 6, "name_slug": "bob-mcdonnell", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mcdonnell.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/308/", "total_count": 39, "true_count": 8, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tVirginia &quot;is home to more veterans per capita than any state in America.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech.", "statement_date": "2012-05-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 111, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/111/", "subject": "Census", "subject_slug": "census", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 30, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/30/", "subject": "Military", "subject_slug": "military", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 51, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/51/", "subject": "Veterans", "subject_slug": "veterans", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
