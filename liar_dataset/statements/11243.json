We decided to dig deeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for teams not to disclose the financial numbers, and, at Monday&rsquo;s press conference, officials were mum about the cost to Mercedes-Benz for the near-record 27 year naming rights. (The Atlanta Falcons keep all revenue from the naming rights under a stadium agreement they struck with the city of Atlanta and Georgia World Congress Center.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Falcons said the goal was to land a deal in the upper range of NFL naming-rights agreements. The largest such deals are a reported $17 million-plus per year for both the New York Giants/Jets&#39; MetLife Stadium and the Dallas Cowboys&#39; AT&amp;T Stadium and $11 million a year for the San Francisco 49ers&#39; Levi&#39;s Stadium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted Donna Boland, manager of corporate communications for Mercedes-Benz USA LLC. We asked for evidence supporting Cannon&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Since he&rsquo;s been with the company for 24 years, more or less, you can take him at his word that this is the biggest marketing initiative we&rsquo;ve undertaken,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boland went on to say: &quot;Unfortunately, as a matter of policy, we don&rsquo;t disclose marketing/sponsorship costs &ndash; for this or for the Saints&hellip;.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact reached out to three academics who focus on sports economy. Their estimates of the annual value of the naming rights ranged from a low of $8 million to a high of $20 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don Muret, who covers sports venues for Sports Business Journal, citing a source who brokers such deals, put the price of the naming rights in Atlanta at $12 million a year, essentially double what has been widely reported as the amount Mercedes-Benz paid in 2011 for the naming rights to the Superdome for 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrew Zimbalist, professor of economics at Smith College, valued the naming rights deal &quot;in the neighborhood of $8 million to $10 million a year,&quot; &nbsp;or minimally $216 million for 27 years, given that &nbsp;&quot;Atlanta is a lesser advertising market and the Falcons are not a team with much cachet.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joel Maxcy, associate professor in the Department of Sports Management at Drexel University in Philadelphia, had the highest projection: $20 million a year, on par with the Dallas and Giants/Jets deals, &nbsp;&quot;given the nature of the stadium and where it is in Atlanta.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maxcy said it is likely a very good deal for Mercedes-Benz, given the national and regional television exposure from the professional and college football games, and even the visibility that the stadium has to commuters and travelers to Atlanta, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When you take the gross value -- say $20 million over 27 years for naming rights, that&rsquo;s why it expands into the biggest deal ever,&quot; Maxcy said. &quot; But in 10 years or 12 years, when everybody&rsquo;s paying double that [for naming rights] that looks really good.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Victor Matheson, professor of economics at College of Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., said he expects the naming rights went for about $11 million, which is what Levi&rsquo;s paid for the stadium in San Francisco and is about right &quot;given the size of Atlanta.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The naming rights deal in Atlanta is one of, but not the longest around, Matheson said. American Airlines has rights to the basketball/hockey area in Dallas for 30 years, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mercedes-Benz has had commercials in past SuperBowls, not a spare-change ticket item. Reports say its naming rights in New Orleans is costing $60 million. On the low end of the estimates we received, the Atlanta naming rights -- 27 years at $8 million -- would total $216 million. (On the high end, 27 years at $20 million, the number jumps to $540 million.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company also has its names on arenas in Shanghai China and Stuttgart Germany. Sports Business Journal has reported that Mercedes-Benz signed the Shanghi deal in 2009 for 10 years at $6 million a year, $60 million total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We tried to find out about Mercedes-Benz marketing investments, but the closest we could come was figures on what it spends on advertising. The auto maker spends about $340 million a year in the U.S. on advertising across all media, according to the monitoring service Kantar Media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bradley Johnson, director of data analytics for the trade publication Advertising Age, said the Mercedes-Benz stadium deal in Atlanta will likely account for just a small part of the automaker&rsquo;s annual marketing budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parent company Daimler in 2014 had estimated U.S. ad spending of $561.9 million, primarily for its Mercedes-Benz business, Johnson said, noting that Daimler also markets trucks and buses under brands including Freightliner, Thomas Built Buses, Western Star and Fuso.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If Mercedes says this is its largest marketing deal ever, then it presumably is Mercedes&rsquo; largest marketing deal ever,&quot; he said. &quot;But most of Mercedes&rsquo; ongoing marketing spending doesn&rsquo;t relate to a single deal. Over the period of this stadium deal, Mercedes is destined to spend billions of dollars on U.S. marketing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our ruling Steve Cannon, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, said at a press conference on Monday, that buying the naming rights to the new Falcons stadium is the largest marketing deal in Mercedes-Benz history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cost of those naming rights wasn&rsquo;t disclosed. The company didn&rsquo;t provide any evidence to back up his statement when we asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts we talk to said the naming rights probably are costing the luxury car dealer between $8 million and $20 million a year, which over 27 years would be on the low end $216 million. Industry analysts say Mercedes-Benz may spend close to that top dollar figure in a single year, but not on a single marketing deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-08-27T16:49:50.260159", "ruling_date": "2015-08-27T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Mercedes-Benz on target with superlative about Atlanta stadium rights", "ruling_headline_slug": "mercedes-benz-target-superlative-about-atlanta-sta", "ruling_link_text": "Falcons keep naming rights money", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<div class=\"cm-story-headline \">\r\n<p>&quot;Falcons officially announce Mercedes-Benz as <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/football/falcons-officially-announce-mercedes-benz-as-namin/nnP9Y/\">naming</a> rights partner,&quot;
