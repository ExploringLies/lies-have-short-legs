The American people can review that. And he&#39;s going -- senator, he&#39;s going to release his tax returns when the audit is over.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit,&quot; Kaine countered <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2016/oct/05/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-correctly-notes-richard-nixon-released-t/\">accurately</a>, before the moderator directed the discussion to Social Security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaine was referencing a 2014 interview Trump did with Irish TV. While he didn&#39;t use those exact words, Kaine&#39;s quote is largely accurate. That was before Trump was actually running for president.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Trump has said he would release his tax returns multiple times since annoucning his candidacy as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Will you release any of your tax returns for the public to scrutinize?&quot; NBC&rsquo;s Chuck Todd <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-january-24-2016-n503241\">asked</a> Trump in January 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, we&#39;re working on that now. I have very big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we&#39;ll be working that over in the next period of time, Chuck. Absolutely,&quot; Trump replied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few weeks later, Trump <a href=\"https://grabien.com/story.php?id=48219\">told</a> the <em>Today Show</em>&nbsp;in February 2016 that&nbsp;he&rsquo;ll release his tax returns &quot;probably over the next few months.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since those comments, Trump has repeated the promise but with conditions. Recently, he&rsquo;s said he would release them <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/26/trump-offers-release-tax-returns-if-clinton-releas/\">once Clinton releases all of her emails</a>. And as Pence mentioned, Trump <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/08/reuters-america-update-2-trump-changes-tune-on-tax-hikes-for-wealthy-americans.html\">has</a> <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/11/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns/\">said</a> repeatedly he has yet to do so because an ongoing IRS audit. (He&rsquo;s also suggested <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/05/11/ap-interview-donald-trump-says-hes-narrowed-vp-shortlist.html\">he probably won&#39;t before election day</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/Tax_Doc.pdf\">According to his tax attorneys</a>, Trump has been &quot;under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service since 2002.&quot; But he&rsquo;s also promised to release his tax returns without this condition and, presumably, while under audit in 2011, 2014 and 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Buzzfeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/donald-trump-tax-returns-birth?utm_term=.lj3vjdYdO#.ucEL6QPQV\">reported</a>, Trump suggested he&rsquo;d &quot;love&quot; to release his tax returns in 2011, when he was flirting with a presidential bid and questioning Barack Obama&rsquo;s birthplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Maybe I&rsquo;m going to do the tax returns when Obama does his birth certificate,&quot; Trump said in an <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2011/04/donald-trump-interview-transcript-part-two.html\">April 18, 2011, interview</a> with ABC. &quot;I may tie my tax returns, I&rsquo;d love to give my tax returns, I may tie my tax returns into Obama&rsquo;s birth certificate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the White House released Obama&rsquo;s birth certificate a week later, Trump <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2011/04/since-president-obama-released-his-birth-certificate-will-donald-trump-release-his-tax-returns.html\">told</a> ABC he would fulfill his pledge and release his tax records &quot;at the appropriate time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few years later, Trump had yet to release his tax returns, prompting an Irish television host to ask him about it in a May 2014 <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Hg-5KEt1Abg\">interview</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You questioned his citizenship during his campaign, and you said afterwards if he produced that long-form birth certificate, you&rsquo;d produce your tax returns. But you didn&rsquo;t do it, did you?&quot; asked TV3&rsquo;s Colette Fitzpatrick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well I don&rsquo;t know, did he do it?&quot; Trump said. &quot;If I decide to run for office, I&rsquo;ll produce my tax returns, absolutely and I would love to do that.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump also repeatedly agreed to release his tax returns in a February 2015 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIMDkxoS1as\">interview</a> with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If he ran for president, Trump said, &quot;I would release tax returns and I&rsquo;d also explain to people that as a person that&rsquo;s looking to make money &mdash; you know, I&rsquo;m in the business of making money until I do this &mdash; and if I won, I would make money for our country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How many years back?&quot; Hewitt asked. &quot;Three years, five years?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The answer is I would do it. But I will tell you upfront, as a private person, and I&rsquo;m very proud of this, I want to pay as little taxes as I can as a private person,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Of course. That&rsquo;s the American way. Legally,&quot; Hewitt agreed. &quot;But how many years back would you go back? Three, five?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t know. I actually have not even thought of that. But I would certainly show tax returns if necessary. Well, what have they been doing? They&rsquo;ve been really doing one year other than people that never made anything. But I would certainly &mdash; I&rsquo;m very proud of what I&rsquo;ve done. I do pay tax, but I&rsquo;m very proud of what I&rsquo;ve done,&quot; Trump said. &quot;I have no objection to showing any tax return.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nineteen months later, and five weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Trump still has not released any returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pence said Trump &quot;hasn&#39;t broken his promise&quot; to release his tax returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said he would &quot;absolutely&quot; release his tax returns in January 2016 and that it&#39;ll happen &quot;probably over the next few months&quot; in February without the stipulation of an IRS audit. He also made the promise&nbsp;in 2011, 2014 and 2015 without conditions. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s still 33 days left before Election Day, so Trump still has time to honor this pledge.
