Those explanations range from a net in-migration of new residents, who increase the number of people looking for jobs, to quality-of-life considerations that tend to keep newly jobless Oregonians from wanting to wander elsewhere.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst District congressional challenger Rob Cornilles, the Tualatin Republican taking on veteran Democrat David Wu, has his own views on the matter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;For each and every one of the 137 months that David Wu has been in Congress,&quot; Cornilles&#39; &nbsp;statement in The Oregonian&rsquo;s Voter Guide asserts, &quot;Oregon&#39;s unemployment rate has been above the national average. We deserve better!&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe basis of Cornilles&#39; claim appears to be that policies and practices endorsed by Wu have led to higher joblessness here than elsewhere for the past 137 months, or 11.5 years. Specifically, &nbsp;Cornilles criticizes Wu for &quot;not providing tax certainty&quot; by failing to extend the Bush-era tax cuts; for supporting the federal stimulus bill; and for failing, after during 12 years in Congress, to gain the kind of influence that would help create jobs across the First Congressional District.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&rsquo;s right that Wu and the rest of Congress did not extend the tax cuts before the current break. He&rsquo;s right Wu voted for the stimulus. And on the 137-month claim, Cornilles is also correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd then some. But is it fair to link Wu to that statistic?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Oregon looked back to 1976, when the state began tracking employment rates. According to state and federal data, Oregon has traditionally and consistently been above the national unemployment figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnly for 66 of the past 418 months, in fact, has Oregon&#39;s unemployment rate dipped below the federal rate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOregon nearly pulled even with the U.S. rate for the first few months in 2008. Both the national and state unemployment figures hovered just above 5 percent before skyrocketing in ensuing months as the worst overall economy since the Great Depression took hold.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe most recent time Oregon&#39;s unemployment rate was below the national rate was February 1996, according to Tom Potiowsky, state economist. That was nearly three years before Wu took office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;With a few exceptions, we were pretty much below the national average from the mid-1990s until February 1996,&quot; Potiowsky said. Oregon&#39;s high-tech boom years accounted for much of that boost, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState economists cite several reasons for the state generally lagging behind the nation on this measure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition to the quality of life and net in-migration factors cited above, they include the lack of a really large metropolitan area in Oregon. If the Portland area&#39;s population were on the order of 4 million, for instance, it could support a labor market large enough to let someone who had lost a job more easily find a comparable one, said David Cooke, an Oregon Employment Department economist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCould Wu have done much to reverse any of these factors? Doubtful, Cooke said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There are so many factors that influence the economy,&#39;&#39; he said. &quot;One congressperson&#39;s actions are a very small contributor, especially when you move down to the state level.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo while Cornilles&#39; 137-month figure is correct, it&#39;s quite a reach to imply that Wu had much to do with it. We find his claim is Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/10/politifact_oregon_cornilles_bl.html\">Comment on this item.</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-12T19:28:26.888011", "ruling_date": "2010-10-14T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rob Cornilles attacks David Wu over Oregon\u2019s high unemployment rate", "ruling_headline_slug": "rob-cornilles-attacks-david-wu-over-oregons-high-u", "ruling_link_text": "One congressman against the whole economy?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRob Cornilles for Congress <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1-4_gUnZjjIFUNlj7ooUZod4w72OEVSdbQnRbJo7Jo30&amp;hl=en\">website</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCornilles&#39; <a href=\"http://thevoterguide.oregonlive.com/race-detail.do?id=200383553&amp;sfr=1286917912201\">The Oregonian Voter Guide submission</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\te-mail exchange with Brock Lowrance of the Cornilles campaign<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tinterview with Tom Potiowsky, Oregon state economist<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOregon Employment Department,<a href=\"http://www.qualityinfo.org/olmisj/OlmisZine\">Labor Market Information</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/lau/\">Local Area Unemployment Statistics</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/\">National Unemployment Statistics</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tinterview with David Cooke, Oregon Employment Department economist</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "consultant", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Rob", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Oregon", "id": 754, "last_name": "Cornilles", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "rob-cornilles", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rob_Cornilles.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/754/", "total_count": 10, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.cornillesforcongress.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays David Wu has presided over &quot;137 months&quot; in which &quot;Oregon&#39;s unemployment rate has been above the national average.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "The Oregonian's Voter Guide", "statement_date": "2010-10-12", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "U.S. representative", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "David", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Oregon", "id": 755, "last_name": "Wu", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "david-wu", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/David_Wu.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/755/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.house.gov/wu/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
