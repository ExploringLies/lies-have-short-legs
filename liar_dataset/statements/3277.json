The GOP argues that amounted to a strike, because the closings occurred after the state&rsquo;s largest teachers union called on all Wisconsin residents to attend the Madison rallies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, no state, local government or public school employees -- all of whom would be affected by Walker&rsquo;s plan to curtail collective bargaining rights -- have formally declared a strike.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut what about the rest of the GOP&rsquo;s claim?</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n\tDid doctors roam the crowds outside the state Capitol handing out phony sick notes to government workers who missed work to protest?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe GOP news release cited a YouTube <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFbMDp5Pg8\">video</a> posted Feb. 19 by the <a href=\"http://maciverinstitute.com/about/\">MacIver Institute</a>, which describes itself as a Madison-based &quot;think tank that promotes free markets, individual freedom, personal responsibility and limited government.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne of the women dressed in medical garb -- her name is not given -- tells the interviewer, &quot;We are writing sick notes for anybody who needs them.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Who&rsquo;s sick?,&quot; the interviewer asks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Everybody is sick of Scott Walker,&quot; the woman says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother woman identifies herself as being one of a &quot;group of doctors representing ourselves, not necessarily our workplaces, providing work excuses for teachers and other union members who need them.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe interviewer also confronts a man, apparently a doctor, who was filling out forms and asks if what he was doing was fraud. &quot;We&rsquo;re not handing out anything. We&rsquo;re assessing people and dealing with them appropriately in the privacy of their own medical consultations,&quot; the man replies. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found other evidence that doctors were handing out notes to public workers to give to their employers:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe Associated Press quoted doctor <a href=\"http://findadoctor.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile.jsp?provider=7375\">Lou Sanner</a> as saying he gave out hundreds of such notes.

We think it&rsquo;s worth the risk to support the people and we feel very strongly that these are professionals who really would like to be in school, they would like to be in school with our classes, but they&rsquo;re put in a position where they really have no choice.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe tried calling Sanner and Oriel but were referred to a medical school spokeswoman. We also called two other doctors at the medical school who have been linked to the sick notes. Their offices referred us to a phone number -- (608) 890-9220 -- that offers a recorded message saying the medical school &quot;will thoroughly investigate these allegations and take appropriate actions as indicated.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat phone line allows callers to record a comment and says people wishing to comment also can send an e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:publicaffairs@uwhealth.org\">publicaffairs@uwhealth.org</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, Milwaukee Public Schools officials have also <a href=\"http://mpsportal.milwaukee.k12.wi.us/portal/server.pt/comm/mps_home/335\">promised</a> an investigation, saying teachers who were &quot;absent without leave or who called in sick since the protests started in Madison&quot; could face disciplinary action.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter days of protests, the state&rsquo;s largest teachers union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, <a href=\"http://www.weac.org/news_and_publications/11-02-20/WEAC_president_talks_about_next_steps.aspx\">said</a> Feb. 20, 2011, that if teachers are not otherwise off, they should report back to the classroom.
