Obama said his perspective about rights for same-sex couples is shaped by the broader political and historical context of his upbringing.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such laws were more widepsread than Obama realizes. At the time of his birth Aug. 4, 1961, 22 states banned interracial marriages, not 12.\n</p>\n<p>\n (For those counting: Arizona, Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.)\n</p>\n<p>\n But it was never an issue for his white American mother and black Kenyan father, who lived in Hawaii. The island state is one of only nine that never declared these marriages illegal.\n</p>\n<p>\n At one time or another, laws against miscegenation were active in close to 40 states.
