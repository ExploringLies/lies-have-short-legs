Roy Barnes, a Democrat, and former Congressman Nathan Deal, a Republican, to determine who will become Georgia&#39;s next governor was to be a civil affair, hard-focused on the key issues. Or, so said both campaigns at the outset.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJust listen to Deal spokesman Brian Robinson in a Sept. 13 metro Atlanta television interview:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;They [voters] want a positive vision and Nathan Deal will offer [that] in tone and in message.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOr Barnes himself in an Aug. 11 TV interview:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You know, it&rsquo;s a Southern tradition to be civil and polite. &hellip; just because we have differences, doesn&rsquo;t mean that we have to call each other names.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOh really now?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe thought today -- four days before Election Day -- would be a good time to look back at those lofty campaign goals as the governor&rsquo;s race nears the finish line. Voters go to the polls on Tuesday to choose between Deal, Barnes or Libertarian John Monds.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd they&rsquo;ll have to wade through a lot of noise from one of the nastiest campaigns in recent Georgia history to cast their ballots for the state&#39;s next chief executive.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere are a few of the campaign&rsquo;s lowlights, brought to you by the campaigns and their Republican and Democratic surrogates:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-- &nbsp;Dale Peterson, a failed GOP candidate for Alabama&rsquo;s agriculture chief, weighs in with a YouTube video for Deal on behalf of the Republican Governors Association.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWearing a white cowboy hat and brandishing a vintage lever-action rifle across his shoulders, Peterson reminds viewers that Georgia voters fired Barnes in 2002 after one term in office: &quot;He screwed things up so badly y&#39;all chunked him out.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPeterson adds: &quot;He&#39;s just the same old amb&rsquo;lance chaser he&rsquo;s always been.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-- The Barnes camp enlisted its own cast of colorful rural types in a television ad that featured two old geezers sipping coffee in a folksy cafe. They incrementally ramp up the trash talk as they bash Deal. Finally one of them delivers a zinger:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;He&rsquo;s slippery as a bag of snakes,&quot; one man intones as the pair breaks into howls of laughter.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd those were just warm-up exercises in character assassination that prefaced what was to become outright fabrication by both camps.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-- The Barnes camp conceded that it added fake audio questions to the soundtrack of a TV ad that shows Deal leaving a debate, apparently trying to evade reporters.<br />\r\n\t&quot;Why won&#39;t you answer questions?&quot; a male reporter appears to yell at Deal in the ad. Then a woman yells: &quot;Why won&#39;t you answer questions?&quot; Trouble was, those reporters did not exist. The Barnes camp simply added audio to make the footage appear more dramatic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t-- The Deal camp, meanwhile, ran a TV ad showing a &quot;quote&quot; from a Barnes campaign aide that was never uttered. The ad quoted Barnes spokeswoman Anna Ruth Williams saying, &quot;Barnes represented the child molester.&quot; She never said those words. The Deal campaign later attributed the quote to an &quot;Ann Williams.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd then there were the just-plain-awful, highly misleading attacks by both camps on the other candidate&rsquo;s voting records two decades back:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t-- In one, Barnes accused Deal of trying to weaken Georgia&#39;s rape shield law. PolitiFact Georgia earlier ruled that Half True because it left out critical context. A male narrator in the ad asks viewers to consider &quot;How many rapes would go unreported?&quot; if the rape shield law had been weakened.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t-- Deal, meanwhile, accused Barnes of trying to make it more difficult to convict child molesters. PolitiFact Georgia ruled that one Barely True, finding it contained only a trace of truthfulness. &quot;Barnes voted against a bill in the state Senate that would have made it easier to gain convictions in child abuse cases,&quot; Deal said in a press release.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUniversity of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock said this year&rsquo;s campaign is one for the books when you rate it on the Nastymeter.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s unprecedented for Georgia,&quot; Bullock said. &quot;It&rsquo;s been the harshest campaign we&rsquo;ve seen for governor.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMuch of the uncivil behavior was predictable. Both campaigns had huge war chests, and well-heeled allies on both the Democratic and Republican fronts were more than willing to join the fray. Polls have shown the race relatively close, which always makes for a bruising campaign. And both Barnes and Deal have long political records each side can target.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKennesaw State University professor Kerwin Swint, who teaches a class on campaigns and elections, said Barnes and Deal have resorted to attack ads for a simple reason: They work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It does with regular voters because they&rsquo;re more likely to pay attention,&quot; said Swint. &quot;It puts attention on the other candidate&rsquo;s vulnerability.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it also leads to an uninformed electorate, numbed by the endless attacks and counterattacks. Somewhere amid it all, the real issues confronting Georgia get lost.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSmoke is rising from this gubernatorial battleground, and it long ago obscured both camps&#39; vows to run a &quot;civil&quot; and &quot;positive&quot; campaign. The race has been about as uncivil and negative as they come.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe give both the Deal and Barnes campaigns our lowest rating: Pants On Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-28T19:11:35.883809", "ruling_date": "2010-10-29T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Candidates claims to run \"civil\" campaign veer off track", "ruling_headline_slug": "candidates-claims-run-civil-campaign-veer-track", "ruling_link_text": "Claims to run \"civil\" campaigns slippery as a bag of snakes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTelephone interview with Barnes campaign spokeswoman Anna Ruth Williams, Oct. 25, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview with Kennesaw State University professor Kerwin Swint, Oct. 27, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview with University of Georgia professor Charles Bullock, Oct. 27, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail from Barnes campaign spokesman Emil Runge, Oct. 26, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRoy Barnes in TV interview with Channel 2 Action News, Aug. 11, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSavannah Morning News, &quot;<a href=\"http://savannahnow.com/news/2010-10-16/barnes-deal-bash-each-other-hard-hitting-ads-0\">Barnes, Deal bash each other with hard-hitting ads</a>,&quot; Oct. 16, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNathan Deal for Governor television ad, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.dealforgovernor.com/reel.php\">How</a>&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWXIA-TV, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.11alive.com/video/default.aspx?bctid=643152611001#/Barnes+Responds+to+Claims+of+Campaign+Attack+Ads./643152611001\">Deal&rsquo;s anti-Barnes ad</a>&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNathan Deal campaign spokesman Brian Robinson, <a href=\"http://www.cbsatlanta.com/news/24995986/detail.html\">television interview</a> with WGCL-TV<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPeterson <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTHLTOmC45s\">ad</a>:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBag of snakes <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIiTUWLbpOg&amp;feature=player_embedded\">ad</a>:</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 809, "last_name": "Roy Barnes and Nathan Deal", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "nathan-deal-and-roy-barnes", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/DealBarnes.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/809/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tVows to keep Georgia&#39;s race for governor &quot;civil&quot; and focused on the &quot;positive.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "statements to the press", "statement_date": "2010-10-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 157, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/157/", "subject": "Message Machine 2010", "subject_slug": "message-machine", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 809, "last_name": "Roy Barnes and Nathan Deal", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "nathan-deal-and-roy-barnes", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/DealBarnes.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/809/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": "Have Barnes and Deal kept their promise to run \"civil\" campaigns? #gapolitics"}
