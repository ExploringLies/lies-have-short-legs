This is one of those times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a rally in New York ahead of that state&rsquo;s primary, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump was introduced by Buffalo Bills football coach Rex Ryan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&#39;s so many things I admire about Mr. Trump, but one thing I really admire about him is, you know what, he&#39;ll say what&#39;s on his mind,&quot; Ryan told the crowd. &quot;But so many times, you&#39;ll see people, a lot of people want to say the same thing. But there&#39;s a big difference. They don&#39;t have the courage to say it. They all think it, but they don&#39;t have the courage to say it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it was Trump&rsquo;s turn to talk, he repaid Ryan with a compliment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You know, he won championships in New York,&quot; Trump said. &quot;The AFC, I think, twice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe align=\"middle\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/iFAt67p9ghE/embed/simple\" width=\"400\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan has coached seven years in New York, six with the New York Jets (who technically play their games in New Jersey) and one with the Bills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has a career coaching record of 58 wins and 61 losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, he <a href=\"http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/RyanRe0.htm\">has never won the AFC championship</a> -- the winner of which goes on to the Super Bowl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan&rsquo;s teams lost in the AFC championship game both in 2009-10 (Indianapolis Colts&nbsp;30, Jets 17) and in 2010-11 (Pittsburgh Steelers 24, Jets 19).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just to round this out, Ryan hasn&rsquo;t won a division championship in New York, nor did he ever play on a New York team that won a championship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This claim rates False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Correction:&nbsp;</strong><em>The Colts made up an 11-point deficit to beat the Jets in the 2009-10 AFC Championship.
