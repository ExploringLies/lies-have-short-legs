Bruce Braley got into a dispute with a neighbor because her chickens wandered onto his vacation property, a lake house in Holiday Lake, Iowa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a website,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://braleychicken.com/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>BraleyChicken.com</u></a>, and reports of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/08/11/the_secrets_of_chickengate.html\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>promotional rubber chickens</u></a>.

How do we expect as Iowans to believe that you will work across the aisle when you can&rsquo;t walk across your yard?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&rsquo;s just not true,&quot; Braley replied. &quot;I never threatened to sue anyone.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chicken incident, which came to light in July, has been well&nbsp;reported. But we wondered about their disagreement at the debate. Did Braley actually threaten to sue or not?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a real dispute over chickens, but we didn&#39;t find evidence for a lawsuit threatened against the neighbor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The backstory</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Braleys&rsquo; neighbor, Pauline Hampton, keeps chickens in her backyard as pets and therapy animals. These chickens were previously unfenced and would occasionally wander onto the Braleys&rsquo; property, and Braley&rsquo;s wife, Carolyn, claimed she could smell them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hampton says she did not know that the chickens were bothering her neighbors until this past spring, when Carolyn Braley told Hampton that she would be filing a complaint to the neighborhood homeowner&rsquo;s association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.holidaylakebrooklynia.com/minutes/2014_rules-regs.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>neighborhood rules</u></a>&nbsp;say, &quot;No animals or birds, other than household pets, shall be kept on any lot.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The Braleys weren&rsquo;t the only Holiday Lake residents who had problems with the chickens, according to <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/the-chickens-that-could-flip-the-senate-221331893.html\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>Yahoo</u></a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-iowa-a-dispute-over-neighbors-chickens-threatens-braleys-senate-bid/2014/08/07/4ae3d5e2-1e47-11e4-ae54-0cfe1f974f8a_story.html\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>Washington Post</u></a></em>, both of which interviewed other Holiday Lake residents.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carolyn Braley&rsquo;s complaint came up at the neighborhood association&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.holidaylakebrooklynia.com/minutes/2014-05.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>board meeting</u></a>&nbsp;in May. The board ruled that the chickens are indeed pets and Hampton could keep them, as long as she fenced them into her yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Problem solved?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, not quite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The lawyer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t appear that any legal action was taken, so why do Republicans keep saying Braley threatened to sue over the chickens?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the matter was settled, the conservative&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://theiowarepublican.com/2014/braley-chicken/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>Iowa Republican</u></a></em>, broke the story after it acquired a series of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://theiowarepublican.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/lacina-email-redacted.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>emails</u></a>. They show that Braley contacted the neighborhood association&rsquo;s lawyer about a week after the board&rsquo;s decision about Hampton&rsquo;s chickens, complaining about the board&rsquo;s &quot;lack of action&quot; and saying he believes &quot;chickens are not pets and should not be permitted at Holiday Lake.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>Iowa Republican&nbsp;</em>treated these emails as a smoking gun.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, these emails -- among the lawyer, the neighborhood association board and Braley -- do not say anywhere that Braley was considering a lawsuit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, they say the opposite. The lawyer, Thomas Lacina, writes: &quot;The implication from Mr. Braley was that he wants to avoid a &lsquo;litigious situation.&#39;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iowa Republicans say that the fact that Braley, a former trial lawyer, hinted at a &quot;litigious situation&quot; is evidence enough that he was considering a lawsuit -- but it still doesn&rsquo;t definitively prove it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One interpretation of the email is that Braley said to the lawyer he wants to &quot;avoid a litigious situation,&quot; but he will sue if he has to. But another interpretation is that Braley told the lawyer he planned to &quot;avoid a litigious situation&quot; under all circumstances.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPoint is, we don&#39;t know what was going on in Braley&#39;s head or the details of private conversations he had with his wife and the lawyer -- and neither does Ernst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(By the way -- Jeff Patch, the author behind the&nbsp;<em>Iowa Republican</em>&nbsp;story,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/08/11/the_secrets_of_chickengate.html\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>is now</u></a>&nbsp;the communications director for the Iowa Republican Party.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesman for Braley told us that &quot;a lawsuit was never part of the picture at all -- nor was there ever any threat of a lawsuit.
