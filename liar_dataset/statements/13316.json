Rob Portman and former Gov. Ted Strickland in which the two politicians quibbled over who&rsquo;s richer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The feuding over fat wallets emerged in the first debate when Strickland announced that he&rsquo;d calculated Portman&rsquo;s hourly earnings at $333.57, after factoring in assets and his <a href=\"https://efdsearch.senate.gov/search/view/annual/0db0c7a4-5d87-4a6c-a0a2-0663ca95ac80/\">$174,000 salary</a> as a U.S. senator. Strickland, a Democrat, juxtaposed the dollar figure with <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/02/15/portman-minimum-wage-plan-wont-work.html\">Portman&rsquo;s stance</a> against raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portman didn&rsquo;t dispute the figure, but in the second matchup between the candidates, he hit back with a calculation of his own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;(Strickland) went to Washington, D.C., and he became a lobbyist,&quot; Portman said. &quot;He made $400,000 a year. So he wasn&rsquo;t living on minimum wage, but he was working against the interests of Ohioans, including the people he used to represent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland sounded surprised, responding, &quot;The senator said I made $400,000. My ... oh, senator, that&rsquo;s a big whopper. I&rsquo;ve never made $400,000 in my life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to take a look at Strickland&rsquo;s earnings. Was he really a lobbyist pulling in $400,000?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some issues with Portman&rsquo;s attack. But he isn&rsquo;t far off with Strickland&rsquo;s post-Congress earnings, if you&rsquo;re willing to include a variety of compensation into the picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first issue with Portman&rsquo;s claim: Strickland was <a href=\"http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/17/portman-strickland-clash-columbus-debate/92299656/\">never </a>a registered lobbyist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After losing his re-election bid to Gov. John Kasich, Strickland took a job with the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. An amended 2015 financial disclosure filing shows that Strickland earned $199,125 between April 2014 to March 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland headed up the political action fund for the think tank. His position is listed as &quot;director/counselor&quot; on the group&rsquo;s tax forms. So technically, he was not a lobbyist himself, but he oversaw the group&rsquo;s lobbying arm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked why Portman called Strickland a lobbyist, campaign spokesperson Michawn Rich said, &quot;He did not misspeak. Ted ran the lobbying arm of the Center for American Progress. It&#39;s a fact.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second problem is that the earnings in question are not as straightforward as a $400,000 salary. You reach that amount by counting income from various jobs and retirement funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Center for American Progress Action Fund reports on its <a href=\"http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2014/300/192/2014-300192708-0bd39862-9O.pdf\">2014 IRS Form 990</a> that Strickland earned &quot;other compensation&quot; in the amount of $13,623. The 990 form reports compensation over nine months, and Strickland was there for a year. So if you divide $13,623 by nine, monthly compensation comes to $1,513. Accounting for a year&rsquo;s time in that position, Strickland would have made about $18,164 in addition to the reported $199,125 income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland also disclosed $20,000 in earnings from consulting at the Bipartisan Policy Center, and $25,000 from working as a mediator with the Washington law firm Taft, Stettinius &amp; Hollister. He reported $36,700 from his state retirement, and $25,500 from a PNC Bank-administered IRA fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland is also earning a federal pension from his 12 years in Congress, which is <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/computation/\">calculated </a>by taking an average of the three-highest salaried years in Congress, multiplying the average by 1.7 percent, and multiplying the result by years of congressional service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland&rsquo;s three highest-earning years in office would have been 2004, 2005, and 2006, so the average comes to $161,800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland was in Congress for 12 years, and 12 x 1.7 percent equals 20.4 percent. We will estimate Strickland&rsquo;s pension, then, to be about $33,000 a year. (No more math after this, okay?)</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>David Bergstein, spokesperson for Strickland&rsquo;s campaign, disagrees that retirement earnings should be included as part of Strickland&rsquo;s earnings in Washington. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subtracting the IRA and retirement fund, Strickland&rsquo;s total annual earnings from a few gigs would be $295,289 &mdash; or <a href=\"http://www.calculators.org/savings/wage-conversion.php\">$141.97 </a>an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portman said Strickland &quot;went to Washington, D.C., and he became a lobbyist. He made $400,000 a year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technically Strickland wasn&rsquo;t a lobbyist; he oversaw a liberal think tank&rsquo;s lobbying and activism arm. As for his income, if you add his disclosed earnings, figures from public IRS forms and retirement income, you get an estimate around $357,000. Not everyone would tally up annual wealth this way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portman&rsquo;s statement is partially accurate but a bit sloppy in the details, so we rate his statement Half True.</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8b114f18-b218-4ac2-9ffa-4217a5401af0\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8b114f18-b218-4ac2-9ffa-4217a5401af0</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-20T16:10:58.207765", "ruling_date": "2016-10-20T17:33:33", "ruling_headline": "Portman, Strickland duel over who's richer", "ruling_headline_slug": "portman-strickland-duel-over-whos-richer", "ruling_link_text": "#1stWorldProblems", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview, Michawn Rich, spokesperson, Rob Portman for Senate, Oct. 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, David Bergstein, Ted Strickland campaign, Oct. 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2014/300/192/2014-300192708-0bd39862-9O.pdf\">2014 Form 990</a>, Center for American Progress Action Fund</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cleveland.com, &quot;Ted Strickland earned $250,000 at think tank,&quot; Aug. 12, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Columbus Dispatch</em>, &quot;Ted Strickland releases tax returns,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2010/04/28/strickland-releases-tax-returns.html\">April 28, 2010 </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Columbus Dispatch</em>: &quot;Portman: Minimum wage plan won&rsquo;t work,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/02/15/portman-minimum-wage-plan-wont-work.html\">Feb. 15, 2014 </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cincinnati Enquirer</em>, &quot;Portman, Strickland clash in Columbus debate,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/17/portman-strickland-clash-columbus-debate/92299656/\">Oct. 17, 2016</a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "U.S. senator from Ohio", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Rob", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 534, "last_name": "Portman", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "rob-portman", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rob-Portman-official-portrait.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/534/", "total_count": 48, "true_count": 17, "website": "http://portman.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Sen.
