Let&rsquo;s see, the unemployment rate is up and credit is tight, but does the city have too much housing?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo the Truth-O-Meter!<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAdrean said the statement is based on conversations she&rsquo;s had with friends in the real estate<br />\r\n\tbusiness and articles she&rsquo;s read in the local media, including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe said she meant that the demand for office as well as residential properties was lower than the inventory.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I would love to be wrong,&quot; Adrean told PolitiFact.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBill Adams, president of Adams Realtors, said there are a few specific examples of an oversaturated market within the city. A few neighborhoods in the city, such as Vine City, have been<br />\r\n\thit hard by foreclosures and as a result have a glut of housing. Likewise, the Buckhead<br />\r\n\tcondominium market is clearly overbuilt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut he said that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s holding back the broader real estate market.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We&rsquo;re not like a suburban county that had vast acres of housing built,&quot; Adams said. &quot;I think<br />\r\n\tmostly it&rsquo;s a result of buyers sitting on the sidelines.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPotential home buyers, many of whom are worried about job security, don&rsquo;t want to take on<br />\r\n\tadditional debt and instead are waiting until the economy stabilizes, he said. Banks, in some cases, have made it tougher to borrow money. All of it creates a critical mass that spells trouble for the Atlanta housing market.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHousing sales data collected by Adams show the average sale price for some neighborhoods, such as Inman Park, an upscale neighborhood of tree-lined sidewalks and expensive Victorian housing, are higher than last year. But prices continue to decline in other areas.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd last year there was a greater incentive to buy because many people were trying to take advantage of the federal housing tax credit before it expired.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSmartNumbers analyst Steve Palm said the city does have an overabundance of depressed<br />\r\n\thousing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe city currently has 6,000 houses for sale under $50,000, Palm said. And in the last year and a half 24,760 houses sold for less than $50,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We have a lot of vacant homes,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven so, Palm said the city does not have too many houses on the market.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Our inventory is way down,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome economists speculate that a lot of people are keeping their properties off the market unless they absolutely have to sell them. That also lowers inventory.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe current housing inventory is about 40 percent lower than 2007 levels, Palm said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf the number of closings for the metro area -- precise numbers for the city proper are hard to come by -- remained stable and there were no additional houses added to the market, it would take 8.7 months to sell off all the houses in the metro area, he said At the peak of the housing boom it would have taken about 14 months to sell off all available housing in the metro area.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis is partly the result of a slowdown in new housing construction, he said. New construction is down 90 percent from the peak years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBill Murray, the managing broker with Prudential Georgia Realty, agrees there is little new housing<br />\r\n\tand points out that the population of Atlanta is growing, albeit slowly. Census numbers for the city are disputed, but it&rsquo;s generally agreed the city&rsquo;s population has increased over the past 10 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis would suggest the city&rsquo;s problem is not an oversupply of housing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Murray said an explosion of foreclosures has helped create an inventory larger than demand.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis is why it&rsquo;s a buyer&rsquo;s market, he said, so in that sense Adrean has a good point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis was a tough one for the old Truth-O-Meter. Adrean&rsquo;s statement does not apply to some<br />\r\n\tpopular intown neighborhoods and new housing starts are few and far between even as the city&rsquo;s<br />\r\n\tpopulation continues to inch up, but demand is still low.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe councilwoman is not wrong, but she&rsquo;s not totally right either.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHer statement is accurate but leaves out important details.
