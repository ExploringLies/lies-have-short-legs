He has consistently supported increased restrictions on abortion and opposed federal funding for stem-cell research.\n</p>\n<p>\n Romney says he is pro-life, but acknowledges that he has not been consistent on the issue over the years.\n</p>\n<p>\n In his 1994 Senate race against incumbent Democratic Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Romney said in a televised debate, \"I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country . . . I believe that since Roe V. Wade has been the law for twenty years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law, and support the right of a woman to make that choice.   \"\n</p>\n<p>\n Romney reiterated his position in his 2002 campaign for governor, saying \"I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Romney said he changed his mind on abortion after meeting with a Harvard stem-cell researcher in 2004.\n</p>\n<p>\n In July 2005, he wrote in a Boston Globe op-ed, \"I am pro-life. I believe that abortion is the wrong choice except in cases of incest, rape, and to save the life of the mother. I wish the people of America agreed, and that the laws of our nation could reflect that view. But while the nation remains so divided over abortion, I believe that the states, through the democratic process, should determine their own abortion laws and not have them dictated by judicial mandate.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Brownback's statement about Romney would have been true if he had referred to the former governor's past position. But since Brownback was clear that it was present-tense, we find the claim to be false.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:37.683611", "ruling_date": "2007-09-12T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Romney now opposes abortion", "ruling_headline_slug": "romney-now-opposes-abortion", "ruling_link_text": "Romney now opposes abortion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Brownback's votes:\n<a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00051\">\n Abortion vote, 108th Congress\n</a>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00402\">\n  Abortion vote, 108th Congress< />\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00127\">\n  Stem cell vote, 109th Congress\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=a9IJUkYUbvI\">\n  Romney on abortion in 1994\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=P_w9pquznG4\">\n  Romney on abortion in 2002\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n TIME MAGAZINE, What Romney Believes, May 10, 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n ABC NEWS, Romney Woos Anti-Abortion Advocates, June 15, 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/Issue-Watch/Values\">\n  Romney campaign Web site\n </a>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "U.S. senator", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Sam", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Kansas", "id": 17, "last_name": "Brownback", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "sam-brownback", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-sambrownback.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/17/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.brownback.com/"}, "statement": "\"I'm pro-life.
