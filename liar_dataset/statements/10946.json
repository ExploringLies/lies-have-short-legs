The board employs 10 full-time staff members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On April 7, the board voted 2-1 to approve a resolution that banned its staff from &quot;engaging in global warming or climate change work while on BCPL time.&quot; The resolution grew out of concerns that Nelson had spent time advocating for climate change policies as part of her role as co-chair of Gov. Jim Doyle&rsquo;s now disbanded task force on global warming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The board is to vote Tuesday June 16, 2015, on a measure that would change the ban from &quot;engaging in global warming or climate change work&quot; to engaging in &quot;policy advocacy&quot; on the board&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About the board </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Walker is not on the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its members, as defined by the state constitution, are three other statewide elected officials -- Attorney General Brad Schimel and state Treasurer Matt Adamczyk, both Republicans, and Secretary of State Doug LaFollette, a Democrat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, the board is not even part of the executive branch. Its 10 employees represent about .0003 percent of the state&rsquo;s about 30,000 total employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cullen Werwie, communications director for the state Department of Administration, said no cabinet agency under Walker had such a ban.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we could not find any such evidence either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the flip side, we did find examples of government engaging in conversation about climate change -- such as on the <a href=\"http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/greatlakes/climatechange.html\">Department of Natural Resources&rsquo; web page</a>, which talks about climate change and the Great Lakes, and the <a href=\"http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/projects/state/docs/2030-chapter10.pdf\">Department of Transportation documents </a>related to its long-term transportation plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A search for the terms &quot;climate change&quot; or &quot;global warming&quot; on wisconsin.gov sites yielded more than 1,000 results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A tenuous connection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Forecast the Facts for back up to its claim, it sent an audio recording of the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands meeting and vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that board, of course, is separate from Walker. And the group&rsquo;s claim was broader, referring generally to state government employees, not just those in one department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brant Olson, the campaign director for the group, could not name any other part of state government with such as ban in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, the group cited a quote from Laurel Patrick, the governor&rsquo;s spokeswoman, in a New York Times article about the board&rsquo;s ban: &quot;Generally, Governor Walker does not think it is unreasonable to enact policies requiring board staff to focus on board-related activities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Olson said the quote showed the climate change ban was &quot;clearly a decision he endorses.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we were reporting this item, though, the group swapped in some new words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The language on the web site was changed to read: &quot;Governors Rick Scott (FL) and Scott Walker (WI) both support state agencies that reportedly ban employees from talking about climate change.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even that could be outdated if the public lands board passes the measure to amend its rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forecast the Facts said Walker runs a state government that bans &quot;employees from talking about climate change.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the group could only name one obscure agency, outside of the governor&#39;s jurisdiction, that has such a rule in place. The rule was aimed at barring its workers from doing climate-change work while on state time. And that rule is poised to be amended. Meanwhile, we found plenty of examples where state agencies were discussing climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-06-15T17:09:27.307624", "ruling_date": "2015-06-16T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Group says Scott Walker bans employees from talking about climate change", "ruling_headline_slug": "group-says-scott-walker-bans-employees-talking-abo", "ruling_link_text": "Not exactly", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-1fd861dc-f90d-876a-baec-16063b4e01cf\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\">Politifact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/10/next-generation-climate-action-committee/group-says-wisconsin-ordered-daughter-earth-day-fo/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Group says daughter of Earth Day founder was ordered not to do climate change work on the job</a>, April 10, 2015. &nbsp;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-1fd861dc-f90d-876a-baec-16063b4e01cf\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\">Phone conversation with Tia Nelson, executive secretary, Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, June 11, 2015. &nbsp;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-1fd861dc-f90d-876a-baec-16063b4e01cf\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\">Phone conversation and email exchange with Brant Olson, campaign director, Citizen Engagement Laboratory, June 2015. &nbsp;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-1fd861dc-f90d-876a-baec-16063b4e01cf\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\">Email exchange with Laurel Patrick, press secretary, Gov.
