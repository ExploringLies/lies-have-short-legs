But is it true that babygate isn&rsquo;t based on reality?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s charge of media distortion sticks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;scandal&quot; started at an Aug. 2 Trump rally in Ashburn, Va. As he was talking about trade, a baby began to cry in the audience, prompting the famously off-the-cuff Trump to chime in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I love babies. I hear that baby cry, I like it,&quot; he said. &quot;What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don&#39;t worry, don&#39;t worry. The mom&#39;s running around, like, don&#39;t worry about it, you know. It&#39;s young and beautiful and healthy, and that&#39;s what we want.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the baby continued to cry, Trump continued to comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Actually I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here,&quot; he said. &quot;I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I&#39;m speaking.

Possibly. An insensitive, heartless, ordinary-person-embarrassing remark? Possibly. Trump&rsquo;s tone is eternally hard to read,&quot; Dale <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2016/08/02/no-donald-trump-did-not-eject-a-baby.html\">wrote</a>. &quot;But, to my eyes, it certainly was not an ejection &mdash; it was an unusually barbed endorsement of the mother&rsquo;s own decision to depart.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC reporter Katy Tur was also at the event and said comment was very clearly a joke and &quot;the baby stayed.&quot; Tur reported about the incident on Bloomberg&rsquo;s <em>With All Due Respect</em> (<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/videos/2016-08-03/full-show-with-all-due-respect-08-02-16\">around the 30 minute mark</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another guest on the program, the Washington Post&rsquo;s Phil Rucker, agreed: &quot;I was there, too. It was a joke. It was definitely a joke.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Associated Press <a href=\"http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/2016/08/trump_jokes_about_ejecting_baby_from_rally\">reported</a> that after saying &quot;you can get that baby out of here,&quot; Trump &quot;then seemed to suggest that he was joking and the baby could stay. The child soon stopped crying.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Devan Ebert, the mother herself, said as much in widely circulated <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205082626184508&amp;set=a.1082486801596.11713.1809138075&amp;type=3\">Facebook</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rik.basye/posts/1209676919063666?hc_location=ufi\">posts</a> soon after the news reports began appearing. Ebert confirmed to PolitiFact that this statement came from her:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;I excused myself and my child when he awoke from his nap and began to cry. It was only because I had to grab my child&#39;s belongings and then make my way out of the aisle I was seated in that I wasn&#39;t out of there sooner. ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;I fully support Mr. Trump. I thought he responded very graciously to my child crying and he made a lighthearted moment out of what I usually consider to be stressful. I actually was out of the auditorium before he even made his follow up comment about my child and even then, when I was informed of his comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;I laughed. I understand he says things jokingly, and I understand no one wants to speak over or struggle to listen over a crying baby. I am in no way offended and I again reiterate, Mr. Trump NEVER kicked me or my child out of the Briar Woods High School, Trump rally.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ebert reiterated this in an interview, telling us she was never kicked out of the rally and Trump still has her vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I appreciate that Mr. Trump made light of an otherwise stressful situation,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time of this report, none of the publications listed above have issued corrections or updated their stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said the media distorted&nbsp;what happened with a baby at his rally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many media outlets reported that Trump &quot;threw out&quot; or &quot;ejected&quot; a crying baby from a campaign event in Virginia, based on his commentary on the incident.
