Bobby Scott, D-3rd, was not pleased with the debt limit deal that became law earlier this month.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said the measure will lead to deep cuts to programs that help needy families, students and seniors while keeping George W. Bush-era tax cuts that benefit the middle-class and wealthy. Scott has long called for ending the tax reductions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The estimated savings of this deal only pay for half of the cost of extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for another decade,&quot; Scott said in an Aug. 1 news release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDo the savings in the debt deaI come to half the price of keeping the Bush tax cuts? We decided to check.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst some background. The deal passed by Congress earlier this month expanded the nation&rsquo;s debt limit to $16.4 trillion -- a $2.1 trillion increase the will give the federal government enough money to pay its bills until early 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe measure requires Congress to cut $2.4 trillion out of the budget over the next 10 years in order to meet or exceed the size of the debt ceiling increase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe deal calls for $900 billion in cuts up front. A recently appointed bipartisan deficit reduction panel is charged with finding an additional $1.5 trillion that could come from spending cuts and revenue hikes, though House Republicans could still block any move to increase taxes.<br />\r\n\tIf the committee deadlocks, there&rsquo;s a trigger in the legislation that would enact $1.2 trillion of cuts to domestic and defense spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the total reduction would be at least $2.1 trillion and could as much as $2.4 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott, in a phone interview, said he used the $2.1 trillion figure in his comparison of spending reductions to the 10-year cost of extending the Bush tax cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJason Peuquest, a policy analyst with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Scott is justified in using the lower figure. &quot;It seems the $2.1 (trillion) is what people are focusing on most because the goal of the super committee is backed up by this automatic trigger,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNorman Ornstein, a resident scholar of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed. He said there is &quot;at least an even chance&quot; that the deficit panel will not reach an agreement, forcing the total of $2.1 trillion in spending reductions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Bush tax cuts were enacted in 2001 and 2003 and scheduled to expire in 2010. Congress, at the end of last year, extended them through 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott pointed us to Congressional Budget Office reports that say the total cost of keeping the tax cuts through 2020 is $3.9 trillion. &nbsp;Of that amount, $3.3 trillion comes from lost revenues and the cost of interest payments needed to service the additional debt caused by the tax relief.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe remaining $600 billion is the cost of maintaining adjustments to the Alternative Minimum Tax. The Bush tax cuts required many Americans who had once itemized their &nbsp;returns to pay the more expensive AMT. As a result, about 20 million Americans lost part or all of the benefits of the tax relief. Congress came to their aid by increasing AMT exemptions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThree analysts said it&rsquo;s legitimate to lump together the expense of extending Bush tax cuts for 10 years with the costs related to increasing the Alternative Minimum Tax exemptions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Back when the (initial Bush) tax cuts were in play, a lot of people thought they wouldn&rsquo;t be given any of the benefits of the tax cuts because more people would be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax,&quot; Peuquet said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo let&rsquo;s sum this up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott says spending cuts required by the recent debt-limit deal pay half the cost of maintaining the Bush tax cuts through 2020.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott figures $2.1 trillion in spending reductions will result from the agreement. That&rsquo;s the smallest amount of cuts Congress is required to make under the deal, but it&rsquo;s a widely-used number because its set in stone.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe CBO says the total cost of extending the Bush tax cuts through 2020 is $3.9 trillion.<br />\r\n\tThat means the spending cuts would equal 53.8 percent of the Bush tax cut costs through the end of the decade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s questionable whether the divided Congress will agree on a bipartisan package of spending cuts and revenue increases to achieve the maximum $2.4 trillion goal in debt savings. If it does, the savings over the decade would equal 61.5 percent of the cost of extending the Bush tax cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut three analysts said Scott&rsquo;s use of the $2.1 trillion figure is solid. His claim lands close to a moving bull&rsquo;s-eye and we rate it True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-08-28T17:14:21.068217", "ruling_date": "2011-08-29T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott says debt-limit deal pays for half of Bush tax cuts", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-says-debt-limit-deal-pays-half-bush-tax-cuts", "ruling_link_text": "His numbers are solid", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tU.S. Rep.
