The headline looked like it belonged in Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Georgia lawmaker pushes bill banning creation of &lsquo;glow in the dark&rsquo; human-jellyfish hybrids,&quot; it screamed over a photo of a contorted face adorned in fluorescent paint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure, back in 2010, the state Senate was roundly mocked for voting to oppose forcing microchips into people. (That measure died, maybe from embarrassment).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So certainly Peach State lawmakers learned their lesson about drafting bills based on internet rumor and speculation. So PolitiFact Georgia set out to right this gross error, easy peasy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Except &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, first the good news. The headline makes a giant leap based on a strict reading of House Bill 287.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill makes no mention of jellyfish. The &quot;Ethical Treatment of Human Embryos Act&quot; would, however, ban human embryos with non-human cells injected into them as well as ... wait for it &hellip; any &quot;human-animal hybrid.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The specifics about the gelatinous sea creatures come from the website of the bill&rsquo;s lead sponsor, state Rep. Tom Kirby, R-Loganville.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill is one of his priorities, which his office webpage describes this way: &quot;The mixing of Human Embryos with Jellyfish cells to create a glow in the dark human, we say not in Georgia. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What in the name of SpongeBob Squarepants is happening here?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kirby points to news articles, touting scientists&rsquo; latest successes in introducing jellyfish genes into various mammals who grow up to glow under a black light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of particular concern to Kirby is a 2008 New York Times article that details researchers who successfully put the jellyfish&rsquo;s fluorescent protein gene into a single-celled human embryo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That test-tube embryo was described as nonviable, which scientists said would never have resulted in a baby. Kirby &ndash; who once used his agricultural economics degree to implant cattle embryos to breed stronger cows &ndash; isn&rsquo;t so sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His proposal would be proactive, to draw an ethical line in the sand for such research in Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m not trying to hurt good, valid research that helps people, but I don&rsquo;t think we should create life like this, just for research,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;I don&rsquo;t think Georgians want what they did, creating a human-jellyfish hybrid, here.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So maybe the bill is not explicit in its language. But the driving force is a concern about mixing humans with what makes jellyfish illuminate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no evidence of any abuse of this technology. Federal guidelines, not to mention the reputation of research facilities, would quash even the idea for the most part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, injecting a fluorescent gene to make a designer glowing baby could be done in theory. And to an ethicist, that is enough to warrant at least discussion, no matter how silly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Could someone who is crazy enough, with enough money, say &lsquo;I want a glow-in-the-dark baby?&rsquo; Sure,&quot; said Kevin FitzGerald, a professor of oncology at Georgetown University and chair of the Catholic Healthcare Ethics. &quot;You or I would consider that crazy. But there are some who would claim it as a right to free expression. That&rsquo;s why there is value in discussing how protective the state needs to be.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those debates about human-critter hybrids are all fun and games, until a centaur loses an eye. Or until scientists and researchers push back on the speculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts helped kill a previous version of Kirby&rsquo;s bill, House Bill 481 in the 2013-2014 legislative session, with testimony that it would harm their ability to save lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those objections remain, especially given what is a fundamental misunderstanding about the role of jellyfish in medical and scientific research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2008 for their work in finding jellies&rsquo; green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, and developing it for research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s now commonly used to track genetic changes as cells divide, giving researchers insight into ways to treat genetic diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explained that way, injecting some jellyfish into cells doesn&rsquo;t seem so wacky. But fears about the &quot;what if&quot; abuses have created a proposal that could stymie other legitimate research, said Dr. Mark A. Kay, a professor of pediatrics and genetics at Stanford University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, the bill would allow a human embryo to be created only through fertilization from a sperm and egg. Scientists, though, are able to and often create them for research purposes (not viability) by using a cellular nucleus &ndash;where the genes live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kirby&rsquo;s bill would put an end to that, and halt approaches being tested to develop human organs for transplants and other efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is an example where you&rsquo;re trying to make a law to stop something quite ridiculous and end up limiting the legitimate efforts to understand genetic developments that can save people,&quot; Kay said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that&rsquo;s not enough for Georgia to be embarrassed, there&rsquo;s more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proposed bill does not stop animal <em>genes </em>from being introduced to human embryos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kay describes genes as the equivalent of a sentence buried in an encyclopedia. Cells, which Kirby&rsquo;s bill bans, are the equivalent of the house where those volumes sit on the shelf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It does not explicitly state you can&rsquo;t transfer a gene into a human chromosome, so it doesn&rsquo;t even stop the ridiculous idea it claims is the threat,&quot; Kay said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why? Because the GFP, which can be created synthetically or extracted from a jellyfish, is a gene that would still be permitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And wouldn&rsquo;t that set the stage for Perimeter road rage incidents where people look like the Hulk, not just act like him?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it seems we&rsquo;re getting silly, it&rsquo;s only because we are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline about glow-in-the-dark Georgians overstates the bill itself. But it captures the intent of the proposal -- to ban human embryos with non-human cells injected into them as well as any &quot;human-animal hybrid.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, weirdly, it captures some of actual discussion happening under the Gold Dome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the headline Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-02-19T14:24:20.467594", "ruling_date": "2015-02-20T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Human-jellyfish headline misleading, but spawned by real bill", "ruling_headline_slug": "human-jellyfish-headline-misleading-spawned-real-b", "ruling_link_text": "Sadly, debate does include some glowing talk", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Raw Story, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2015/02/georgia-lawmaker-pushes-bill-banning-creation-of-glow-in-the-dark-human-jellyfish-hybrids/#.VN36r52e4TG.facebook\"><strong>Georgia lawmaker pushes bill banning creation of &lsquo;glow in the dark&rsquo; human-jellyfish hybrids,</strong></a>&quot; Feb. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/georgia-senate-opposes-forcing-microchips-into-peo/nQcHq/\"><strong>Georgia Senate opposes forcing microchips into people,</strong></a>&quot; Feb. 4, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia General Assembly legislation, 2015-2016 session, <a href=\"http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/Display/20152016/HB/287\"><strong>House Bill 287</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, <a href=\"http://legislativenavigator.myajc.com/#bills/HB/287\"><strong>Georgia Legislative Navigator, House Bill 287</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Representative Tom Kirby official web page,<a href=\"http://kirbyforgeorgia.com/481-2/\"><strong> Issues 2015</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WSB-TV.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/lawmaker-proposes-bill-ban-mixing-human-animal-emb/nj8xW/\"><strong>Lawmaker proposes bill to ban mixing human, animal embryos,</strong></a>&quot; Feb. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/13/science/13embryo.html?_r=0\"><strong>Engineering By scientists on embryo stirs criticism,</strong></a>&quot; May 13, 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/08/15/212294823/whats-up-with-that-doc-researchers-make-bunnies-glow\"><strong>What&rsquo;s up with that, doc,?</strong></a>&quot; Aug. 15, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Geographic, &quot;<a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/05/photogalleries/glowing-animal-pictures#/crystal-jelly-gfp-glowing-animals_11833_600x450.jpg\"><strong>Glowing Animals: Beasts Shining for Science,</strong></a>&quot; May 14, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christian Science Monitor, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2013/0813/Bunnies-glow-green-in-the-dark-join-lots-of-other-glowing-animals\"><strong>Bunnies glow green in the dark,</strong></a>&quot; Aug. 13, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Scientist, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17194-gm-monkey-passes-jellyfish-gene-to-offspring.html#.VOT1AixInfc\"><strong>GM monkey passes jellyfish gene to offspring,</strong></a>&quot; May 28. 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/02/17/georgia-lawmaker-wages-battle-against-human-jellyfish-hybrids/\"><strong>Georgia lawmaker wages battle against human-jellyfish hybrids,</strong></a>&quot; Feb. 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/pop/articles/122399sci-genes-insert.html\"><strong>Scientists place jellyfish genes into monkeys,</strong></a>&quot; Dec. 23, 1999</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia General Assembly legislation, 2013-2014 session,<a href=\"http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/Display/20132014/HB/481\"><strong> House Bill 481</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Royal Society of Chemistry, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2008/October/08100802.asp\"><strong>Green fluorescent protein takes Nobel Prize,</strong></a>&quot; Oct. 8, 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with state Rep.
