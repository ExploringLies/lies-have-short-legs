At 53 percent, the unemployment rate for black males in the city would be nearly seven times that of the state overall.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked about the statement, Pratt told PolitiFact Wisconsin a person he trusts told him shortly before the TV interview that the black male unemployment rate in Milwaukee was 52 percent. He then checked with that person and told us the figure -- actually 53 percent -- came from a report by University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee urban studies professor <a href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu/ced/levine.cfm\">Marc Levine</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, Von&rsquo;s statement and the Business Journal article also trace back to the same October 2010 <a href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu/ced/publications/blackjoblessness_2010.pdf\">report</a> by Levine, who is a senior fellow at UWM&rsquo;s Center for Economic Development.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the official unemployment rate in 2009 for black males in metro Milwaukee, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/gp/pdf/gp09_27.pdf\">33.3 percent</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, what&rsquo;s going on here?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe difference is what is measured by the federal government&rsquo;s official unemployment rate and what Levine terms the &quot;jobless rate.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Federal approach</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe federal government <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm#unemployed\">defines</a> the unemployed as people over age 16 who do not have a job but are available for work and have actively looked for work in the prior four weeks. That is, people out of work and looking for a job.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe unemployment rate is not calculated by using the number of people who file claims for unemployment insurance benefits, but is based on responses to the government&rsquo;s monthly surveys of some 110,000 people across the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the Milwaukee metropolitan area, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/gp/pdf/gp09_27.pdf\">figures</a>, the overall unemployment rate for 2009 was measured as 9.4 percent. When broken down, the rate for black males -- 33.3 percent -- exceeded the rate of 7.9 percent for white males and 11.2 percent for Hispanic males.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Levine&#39;s approach</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLevine&rsquo;s approach counts people who are out of work and looking for a job -- and nearly everyone else.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe looks at everyone between the ages of 16 and 64, including those who choose not to work, such as homemakers and early retirees, and those who cannot work, such as those behind bars or with disabilities. It also includes those in high school or college -- even those going back to school for more education to get a better job.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLevine&rsquo;s report focuses strictly on male &quot;joblessness.&quot; His approach puts the metro Milwaukee &quot;jobless&quot; rate for white males at 22.3 percent and 32 percent for Hispanic males. Like African-American males, those come in higher than the official numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLevine argues that the same approach is used by scholars such as Harvard University&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/william-julius-wilson\">William Julius Wilson</a>. He says it is better because the official rate understates the number of people not working -- the federal measure does not include the long-term unemployed who have stopped looking for jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Levine&rsquo;s approach, which he began using in 1990, overstates the number. Indeed, with his approach the rate could never reach zero -- a point he concedes in the report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLevine&rsquo;s approach has been controversial even within UWM.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn December 2009, UWM&rsquo;s Employment and Training Institute criticized the 2009 version of Levine&rsquo;s joblessness report for what it said was his &quot;<a href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu/eti/2009/AfricanAmericanMaleWorkforce.pdf\">misuse of the &lsquo;jobless&rsquo; </a><a href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu/eti/2009/AfricanAmericanMaleWorkforce.pdf\">statistic</a> as a proxy for unemployment.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the institute, Levine&rsquo;s report counted 88 percent of 16- to 19-year-old metro Milwaukee black males as jobless, even though most of them were enrolled in school.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn response, Levine issued a 14-page <a href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu/ced/publications/joblessness0810.pdf\">rejoinder</a> in which he quoted the sections of his studies that explain the differences between his jobless rate and the unemployment rate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat do others say?</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<a href=\"http://www.cows.org/about_staff_detail.asp?id=2\">Laura Dresser</a>, associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Levine&rsquo;s jobless rate includes unemployed people who are no longer in the work force. But it doesn&rsquo;t tell how many of those people choose not to work or are incapable of working, she said.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<a href=\"http://www.epi.org/pages/economist/#filion\">Kai Filion</a>, a policy analyst with the <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/pages/about_the_economic_policy_institute/\">Economics Policy Institute</a>, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said Levine&rsquo;s measure has greater value during a recession because it includes discouraged workers who have stopped looking for jobs. But it is wrong for anyone to portray the jobless rate as the unemployment rate, Filion said.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYet that is what has happened, repeatedly, with those citing Levine&rsquo;s report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe result is a distorted view of a serious problem -- one being tackled most recently by the African-American Male Unemployment Task Force, created in 2010 by the Milwaukee Common Council.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s bring our work to an end.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his effort to catalog Milwaukee&rsquo;s woes, former Acting Mayor Marvin Pratt said the city&rsquo;s unemployment rate among black males tops 50 percent. Pratt said he was relating the finding of a recent UWM study. But that study uses a broader &quot;joblessness&quot; measure than the conventional unemployment rate, and looks at the full metropolitan area, not just the city. As such, Pratt falls into a trap others have before him -- stating one measure as another.
