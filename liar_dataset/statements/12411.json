Clinton says those links now do exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When you say we&#39;re going to bar all Muslims, you are sending a message to the Muslim world and you&#39;re also sending a message to the terrorists because we now do have evidence,&quot; Clinton said <a href=\"https://iqmediacorp.com/ClipPlayer/?ClipID=76bcc57c-2250-4061-8cd2-b2996a9541c2\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>May 19</u></a> on CNN. &quot;We have seen how Donald Trump is being used to essentially be a recruiter for more people to join the cause of terrorism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, has something changed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not long after Clinton&rsquo;s initial comments, Al Shabaab, the East African affiliate of the al-Qaida terrorist group, released a 51-minute video telling &quot;Muslims of the West&quot; that they are not welcome in countries like the United States. Ten minutes into the video, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35213286\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>it says</u></a> the United States has a history of &quot;slavery, segregation, lynching, and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It then cuts to Trump calling for a temporary but &quot;total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S,&quot; according to SITE Intelligence Group, which studies jihadist propaganda, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/01/al-qaeda-linked-group-cites-donald-trump-in-terrorist-recruiting-video/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>as reported by the </u><em><u>Wall Street Journal</u></em></a>. It urges American Muslims to leave the United States and join the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, on March 24, <em>Newsweek </em>reported that an ISIS video released in the wake of the Brussels attack featured an audio clip from Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Brussels was one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities of the world 20 years ago. It was amazing, actually, and safe. And now it&#39;s a horror show. It&#39;s an absolute horror show,&quot; Trump says <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/274193-isis-releases-video-after-brussels-attack\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>in the video</u></a>, as ISIS lets the phrase &quot;absolute horror show&quot; repeatedly echo and fade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&#39;s initial statement in December &quot;was false at the time,&quot; said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. &quot;It&rsquo;s true now.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&#39;s comment in the Brussels video may not seem inflammatory, he said, yet &quot;if you game it out from the perspective of, say, ISIS and they think Donald Trump is a great recruiting tool, then probably they don&#39;t want to play him up too much before the election because they&#39;d want him to win.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There may be other videos, Gartenstein-Ross said. &quot;Unlike in the past when you had multiple analysts watch every al-Qaida release, ISIS&#39;s video production operation is so large, it&#39;s really hard for people to watch every single ISIS release because they release so much. They&#39;re extraordinarily prolific. I would wager there are other uses of him in their propaganda.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;We now do have evidence. We have seen how Donald Trump is being used to essentially be a recruiter for more people to join the cause of terrorism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That wasn&#39;t the case the first time Clinton claimed this.
