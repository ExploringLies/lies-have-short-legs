This comes after Democrats targeted Julie Parrish, the Republican candidate, for the very same thing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Oregon already looked into <a href=\"http://politifact.com/oregon/statements/2010/sep/24/future-pac-oregon-house-democrats/oregon-democrats-claim-julie-parrish-wants-sales-t/http://politifact.com/oregon/statements/2010/sep/24/future-pac-oregon-house-democrats/oregon-democrats-claim-julie-parrish-wants-sales-t/\">the charge </a>levied against Parrish and found it lacking, but now Republicans say Rasmussen was just using those allegations as a way to cover up his own support for a sales tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Why are Will Rasmussen and the House Democrats making false claims about Parrish&#39;s position on sales taxes?&quot; reads the e-mail from the House Republicans. &quot;Are they trying to mask Rasmussen&#39;s support of a sales tax as recently as last spring?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe figured if we fact checked the Democrats&rsquo; claim and found it to be a little less than truthful, it might be worth our time to check in on the Republicans, too.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe e-mail we received from the Republicans cites comments Rasmussen made on March 15, 2010, at a Washington County Public Affairs Forum as the basis for the attack. Specifically, it highlights a piece of an answer about the state&rsquo;s initiative petition process.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the way the Republicans framed the remarks: &quot;Rasmussen told the Washington County Public Affairs Forum that Oregon should look &lsquo;at alternative funding sources, certain transactions that may be taxable.&rsquo;&quot; (That second quote is them quoting Rasmussen.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, we went back to the <a href=\"http://washingtoncountyforum.org/2010/03/23/house-district-37%20\">video of the forum</a>. The comment came up after an audience member asked what the candidates thought about a proposal to make the monetary impact of ballot initiatives clearer to voters. Rasmussen used the question as an opportunity to talk about the state&rsquo;s revenue structure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the bulk of what he said: &quot;Oregon has the 3rd most volatile state revenue of any state in the Union. That&#39;s, of course, because we&#39;re so reliant on the income tax here in Oregon. And that&#39;s the most volatile tax. We have high highs and low lows. And what this does is create with mathematical certainty a funding crisis when the economy&#39;s bad. And here we find ourselves again six years or eight years after the last recession in a really bad economy and lo and behold we don&#39;t have dollars to go around. This is predictable insanity the way we currently have this structure set up. The challenge is how we fix it. There&#39;s several ways to go about it. You look at alternative funding sources, certain transactions that may be taxable, a lot of folks want to look at a rainy day fund, and I think that makes a lot sense. That would help flatten out the highs and the lows of our revenue structure.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHouse Republicans were upfront with the comments leading up to the talk about taxable transactions, but they left out Rasmussen&rsquo;s more-vocal support for a larger rainy day fund. That little bit goes a long way, we think, because Rasmussen clearly endorses that idea. &quot;I think that makes a lot sense,&quot; he says of the rainy day fund. With the bit about transactions, though, he seems to simply be naming one alternative that has popped up over the years: &quot;You look at alternative funding sources, certain transactions that may be taxable.&quot; There, his tone appears to be more matter-of-fact. It seems clear to us that he supports the rainy day fund, but he doesn&rsquo;t offer the same vocal support to a possible sales tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Oregon talked to Rasmussen to see if he could explain his remarks. &quot;We were discussing Oregon&rsquo;s volatile revenue,&quot; he said, &quot;and I was just summarizing the two general proposals that I had heard other people talking about neither of which were policy proposals that I was advocating.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUpon review of the actual comments, it is clear that while Rasmussen might have mentioned a sales tax (and, yes, we think &lsquo;&quot;transactions that may be taxable&quot; is pretty much code for sales tax), he isn&rsquo;t advocating for one. We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/10/politifact_oregon_did_rasmusse.html\">Comment on this item.</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-01T15:36:33.261267", "ruling_date": "2010-10-05T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "House Republicans accuse Will Rasmussen of supporting sales tax", "ruling_headline_slug": "house-republicans-accuse-will-rasmussen-supporting", "ruling_link_text": "One sales tax accusation deserves another?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tE-mail from House Republicans, Sept. 27, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWashington County Public Affairs Forum, <a href=\"http://washingtoncountyforum.org/2010/03/23/house-district-37%20\">Video</a> , March 15, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Will Rasmussen, Sept. 29, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Political action committee", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Oregon", "id": 724, "last_name": "Promote Oregon Leadership PAC (Oregon House Republicans)", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "promote-oregon-leadership-pac-oregon-house-republi", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GOP_elephant__.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/724/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.oregonhouserepublicans.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Will Rasmussen supported a sales tax as recently as last spring.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an e-mail", "statement_date": "2010-09-27", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Attorney", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Will", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Oregon", "id": 725, "last_name": "Rasmussen", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "will-rasmussen", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Will_Rasmussen.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/725/", "total_count": 0, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://votewillrasmussen.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
