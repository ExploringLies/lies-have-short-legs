Mark Begich, is an ineffective lawmaker compared to other Alaska senators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a recent Sullivan campaign mailer, Begich -- who has been in office since 2009 -- has passed zero pieces of legislation during his first term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sullivan campaign reinforced this line of attack in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DanSullivanforAlaska/photos/pb.698400060189827.-2207520000.1411049939./897033813659783/?type=1&amp;theater\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Facebook meme</u></a> that said Begich has passed one bill, and all it did was name a building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This meme compared Begich&rsquo;s record to that of other Alaska senators, saying that Begich&rsquo;s predecessor, the late Republican Sen. Ted Stevens, passed 13 bills during his first term in the chamber, and that current Sen. Lisa Murkowski, also a Republican, passed five during her first term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered: Did only one of Begich&#39;s bills pass during his first term? And is that the only way to measure his effectiveness as a legislator?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We searched the <em>Congressional Quarterly </em>congressional database and found that since becoming a senator in 2009, Sen. Begich has only sponsored one bill that was eventually enacted, and that bill was to <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s1710\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>name an Alaska courthouse</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Sullivan has a point. But it&rsquo;s a point that should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the claim has quickly become outdated. Last week -- after the mailer and meme first appeared -- the Senate and House passed a Begich-sponsored bill to increase veterans&rsquo; disability compensation that <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s2258\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>President Barack Obama</u></a> is expected to sign into law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, counting the number of passed bills sponsored by a lawmaker is not the only -- or even the best -- way to gauge their effectiveness. In reality, there are many ways for a member of Congress to get desired legislation to the president&rsquo;s desk beyond being the bill&rsquo;s chief sponsor, said Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are some lawmakers who sponsor or cosponsor a lot of bills, but it doesn&#39;t reflect much of anything,&quot; he said, adding that the name on a bill that passes may be more of a reflection of who chaired the committee of jurisdiction rather than the member who actually drove the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Begich has co-sponsored 37 bills that became law. For seven of these laws, he was one of five or fewer&nbsp;co-sponsors, meaning he likely would have had tangible influence over the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And on three of these, Begich was the sole cosponsor of bills put forward by Murkowski, his fellow Alaska senator. All three dealt with Alaska-specific issues, such as Denali National Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, a lawmaker&rsquo;s name doesn&rsquo;t have to be on a bill to accomplish legislative goals. Here are a few examples for Begich:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr2838\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2012</u></a> included a provision authored by Begich that explored the possibility of a deep-water port in the Arctic. Begich didn&rsquo;t sponsor or co-sponsor that bill, which originated in the House, but he did sponsor the <a href=\"https://beta.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-bill/1665\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>corresponding Senate version</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; In <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/24/mark-begich/mark-begich-ad-says-he-forced-dc-open-arctic-oil-d/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a previous fact-check</u></a>, we found that Begich had played a key role in getting Washington to open up the Arctic Ocean to oil drilling for the first time in decades. A lawyer involved with the efforts told PolitiFact at the time that Begich&rsquo;s &quot;biggest influence has been picking up the phone or having those people into his office or in hearings and saying &lsquo;Dammit, we need to get this done.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; In 2012, Alaska Native tribal health programs signed an agreement with the Department of Veterans&rsquo; Affairs that allowed Alaska Native veterans to receive medical care in tribal areas, rather than having to travel to Anchorage or Seattle. The <a href=\"http://fmo.dmva.alaska.gov/Documents/newsletters/DMVA%20CRM%202012%20Q%202%20newsletter.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Alaska Army National Guard</u></a> and the <a href=\"http://www.searhc.org/news-releases/searhc-signs-agreement-to-provide-local-care-for-veterans\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium</u></a> both said Begich supported that effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; In the 2009 economic stimulus package, Begich fought for funds that benefited Alaska military bases and that helped build a hospital in Nome, Alaska, <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/03/20/187513_categorizing-alaskas-begich-depends.html?rh=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>McClatchy reported.</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, Begich heads the Senate&rsquo;s Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, which has responsibilities beyond passing legislation, including improving the party&rsquo;s relationship with traditionally Republican constituencies, according to his <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/member-29230?5\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>profile</u></a> in <em>Congressional Quarterly</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So simply looking at the number of Begich-sponsored bills signed into law doesn&rsquo;t give a full sense of his activities in the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth remembering that partisan gridlock has meant that a historically low number of bills are passing these days, meaning fewer opportunities for Begich -- or anyone else -- to get their names on a signed bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of July, about 800 bills have become law since Begich took office in 2009, according to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/07/09/the-113th-congress-is-historically-good-at-not-passing-bills/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>compiled GovTrack data</u></a>. If every member of Congress were to pass the same number of bills, that would break down to about 1.5&nbsp;bills per person over the 5.5-year period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was much different in Stevens&rsquo; first term, which ran from 1969 to 1974. Congress passed nearly 800 bills between 1973 and 1974 alone. (We don&rsquo;t have data back further than that.) That breaks down to about 1.5&nbsp;bills per person in just two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sullivan said Begich is ineffective because he has passed only &quot;one bill, the naming of a building.&quot; Technically, Sullivan has a point -- at the time Sullivan&rsquo;s post went up, Begich had only sponsored one bill that was eventually enacted, and it named a courthouse. Another Begich-sponsored bill concerning veterans&rsquo; issues subsequently passed both the House and Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this is an oversimplification, since Begich has had success pushing a legislative agenda in ways that don&rsquo;t end up with his name on an enacted bill. Notably, Begich has been one of a small number of co-sponsors on bills that have passed, and legislative language he sponsored has ended up enacted in bills with someone else&rsquo;s name on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-09-22T11:51:23.355586", "ruling_date": "2014-09-22T12:24:03", "ruling_headline": "Senate candidate Dan Sullivan says Sen.
