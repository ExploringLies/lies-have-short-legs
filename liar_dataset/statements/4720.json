Jon Huntsman uses a wind-up monkey.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn one side-by-side video comparison, the ad shows video of Romney first saying, &quot;I believe that abortion should be<a href=\"http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-10-28/politics/30331847_1_jon-huntsman-huntsman-spokesman-tim-miller-flip-flops#\"> </a>safe and legal in this country,&quot; then saying, &quot;I have consistently been pro-life.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClearly, the ad is charging Romney with flip-flopping on abortion. So we decided to see whether the charge is accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s look at some of the things Romney said earlier in his career about abortion, when he was waging a losing bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts and winning the governorship a few years later. Here are two of the clearest statements of his position.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; &nbsp;In a debate during his 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, &quot;I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country.&quot; Referring to the <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html\">1973 Supreme Court decision</a> that lmade abortion legal in every state, Romney added, &quot;I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; &nbsp;In his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, &quot;I will preserve and protect a woman&#39;s right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe believe that these two comments -- made in highly public forums and eight years apart -- represent pretty solid evidence that Romney was an abortion-rights supporter during that phase of his political career.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about his views today? The &quot;issues&quot; portion of his website doesn&rsquo;t list abortion, but Romney wrote a June 18, 2011, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0611/57269.html\">op-ed</a> in the conservative <em>National Review </em>that lays out his abortion views pretty clearly. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I will reinstate the Mexico City Policy to ensure that nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from America refrain from performing or promoting abortion services as a method of family planning, in other countries. &nbsp;This includes ending American funding for any United Nations or other foreign assistance program that promotes or performs abortions on women around the world.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I will advocate for and support a Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion. And perhaps most importantly, I will only appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbortion opponents may disagree on exactly where on the anti-abortion spectrum Romney falls, and <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3279653&amp;page=1\">questions have been raised</a> about how fully and quickly Romney made his ideological transition after the event he cites as the spark -- a meeting with a Harvard stem-cell researcher in 2004.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, we believe these issues are outside the scope of the claim in Huntsman&rsquo;s ad. Simply put, Romney&rsquo;s views on abortion are vastly different today than what he expressed in the 1994 and 2002 debates. Huntsman&rsquo;s claim that Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion rates a True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-02T12:56:42.042595", "ruling_date": "2011-11-02T15:18:09", "ruling_headline": "Jon Huntsman accuses Mitt Romney of flip-flopping on abortion", "ruling_headline_slug": "Says-Mitt-Romney-flip-flopped-on-abortion", "ruling_link_text": "A clear change of views on abortion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tJon Huntsman, &quot;Backflip&quot;
