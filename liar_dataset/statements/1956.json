Bush and Republicans  for fiscal decisions of the past decade. But in some cases, the  Democrats have gotten their facts wrong. <br /><br />In a speech on the  Senate floor on June 24, 2010, Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse  of Rhode Island criticized the Bush Administration for squandering a  federal surplus.<br style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\" /><br style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\" />\"When George Bush took  office, President Clinton, a Democrat, and the Democratic Congress at  the time had left an annual budget that was in surplus,\" Whitehouse  said. \"It was returning more money to the federal government than we  were spending. It was an annual budget in surplus. We had a national  debt at the time, but with the annual budget in surplus, our  Congressional Budget Office &mdash; the nonpartisan, not Republican, not  Democratic, professional Congressional Budget Office &mdash; had estimated  that, when George Bush took office, we would be a debt-free nation by  2009. We would be a debt-free nation by 2009. That was the trajectory  that Democratic President Bill Clinton and the Democratic Congress left,  along with those annual budget surpluses, when George Bush and the  Republicans took office.\"<br /><br />We won't delve into the varying degrees  of blame that Clinton and Bush deserve for the current deficit and debt  in this item. But when Whitehouse says that \"Clinton, a Democrat, and  the Democratic Congress at the time had left an annual budget that was  in surplus,\" he's wrong.<br /><br />When Clinton handed over the reins to  Bush, there was a Republican Congress, not a Democratic one. In fact, it  wasn't even a close call: For the last six years of Clinton's term, the  GOP had been in control of both the House and the Senate.<br /><br />We'll  note that on the numbers, rather than the party labels, Whitehouse is  correct. In 2000, Clinton's final year in office, the federal government  ran a surplus of $236 billion. The following year, Bush's first as  president, the surplus was $128 billion. That was the last time the  government ran a surplus, at least as of now. In early 2001, the CBO did  indeed predict surpluses as far as the eye could see -- enough to  eliminate the debt by 2009, as Whitehouse said.<br /><br />When we contacted  Whitehouse's office, a spokesman acknowledged that the statement could  have been articulated more clearly, but added that the senator was  referring to the 1993 Clinton budget, which was passed narrowly by a  Democratic House and Senate with widespread Republican opposition. Many  economists argue that this blueprint set the table for the budget  surpluses of the 1990s.<br /><br />So we see where Whitehouse, who got elected to the Senate in 2006,&nbsp; is coming from  with this explanation. But when we looked at the words he spoke on the  Senate floor, we decided that they did not indicate he was referring to the 1993 budget. <br /><br />In cases where we think someone  simply misspoke inadvertently, we give them leeway. And we'll credit  Whitehouse for repeating the numbers accurately. But in this case,  Whitehouse said the same mistake twice -- and it was crucial to the  point he was making on assigning partisan blame. Any listener not  intimately familiar with budget legislation from the 1990s would be led  to believe that the Democrats controlled Congress when Bush became  president. So even though the mistake was inadvertent, we think it's  sufficiently noteworthy to call out Whitehouse. We rate his statement  False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-25T13:20:31.001590", "ruling_date": "2010-06-25T15:37:07", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
