But we did wonder whether Zaccaria&rsquo;s calculation was correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked him for his source, Zaccaria said he&rsquo;d been using the 25-percent estimate since he ran for Congress in 2010. He said he&rsquo;d done research to justify the figure, but after two years couldn&rsquo;t recall the specific source of the statistic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we went to the website of the Department of Labor and Training, which tracks the number of jobs in the state month by month and year by year. According to its <a href=\"http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/ces/seasonal/2012.htm\">October 2012 report</a>, the&nbsp; most recent, Rhode Island had 463,300 non-farm jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe department breaks down those jobs into more than two dozen categories, including federal, state and local government workers. The local government category includes public school teachers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you combine the local and state government numbers for October 2012, you get about 50,000 jobs, or about 11 percent of that 463,300 statewide job total -- less than half of Zaccaria&rsquo;s estimate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven if you add in the 10,000 federal government employees in the state, that would bring the number up to about 60,000, or about 13 percent of the state&rsquo;s work force.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause Zaccaria said he&rsquo;s been using his 25-percent figure since 2010, we went back to the 2010 numbers to see whether things were different then. They weren&rsquo;t.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe closest he would have come was January 2010, the month when the number of total jobs was lowest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCombined state and local government employees were counted at about 52,000 that month, 11.7 percent of that month&rsquo;s 444,500 statewide jobs. Including 10,200 federal jobs that month would have bumped the public employee sector share to 14 percent, still short of 25 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRhode Island State Republican Chairman Mark Zaccaria said that 25 percent -- one in four -- of paychecks in the state of Rhode Island go to state workers, municipal workers and public school teachers. But state labor statistics show the figure is closer to 11 percent, or about 1 in 9. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rule his claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">False</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(if you have a claim you&rsquo;d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at <a href=\"mailto:politifact@providencejournal.com\">politifact@providencejournal.com</a>.
