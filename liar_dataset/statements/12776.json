Ron Johnson aired <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/383878181.html\">a TV ad</a> emphasizing his humble beginnings as a dishwasher and machine operator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin <a href=\"http://www.wisdems.org/news/dpw-launches-new-radio-ad-calling-out-sen-johnsons-record-of-failure-for-small-town-and-rural-wisconsinites\">released a radio ad</a> arguing just the opposite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad painted the Republican Johnson as a &quot;multi-millionaire CEO turned Senator&quot; out of touch with the needs of Wisconsinites living in rural areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Living in the country doesn&rsquo;t mean we should have fewer opportunities,&quot; the speaker says. &quot;Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s what Wisconsin gets with Sen. Ron Johnson.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later the speaker says: &quot;He opposes faster broadband internet in small towns. Maybe because he got nearly $90,000 in campaign contributions from the telecom special interests.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, running against Johnson, <a href=\"http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/news/local/oconto-county/2016/04/27/feingold-laws-needed-improve-rural-broadband/83599610/\">has argued</a> for rural broadband to be more like a public utility. Johnson opposes that idea. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean he opposes bringing faster broadband to rural areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s examine the two parts of the claim one at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Faster internet in rural small towns</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many Wisconsinites in rural areas lack access to reliable, high-speed internet. While the Federal Communications Commission has said maximizing access to broadband internet is a priority, there is widespread disagreement about how to pay for the infrastructure upgrades needed to make it a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry Hartfield, communications director for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin said Johnson&rsquo;s voting record demonstrates he opposes to faster broadband in rural areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He pointed to two votes in particular:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>In 2012, Johnson voted for a Senate bill <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/112th-congress/senate-amendment/2273\">amendment</a> that would have eliminated the authority of the Agriculture Department to increase the amount of federal grants to provide broadband access in rural areas.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>In 2013, Johnson voted against a Senate bill <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/113th-congress/senate-amendment/998\">amendment</a> that established a pilot program to expand high speed broadband service to rural areas.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If (Johnson) supported faster internet in rural communities, he would have supported legislation that did just that,&quot; Hartfield said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hartfield also noted Johnson and five other Republican senators argued the definition of broadband was &quot;too fast&quot; in a <a href=\"http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/letter_to_fcc_chairman_wheeler_-_broadband_definition.pdf\">2016 letter</a> to the FCC chairman, since few applications require download speeds of 25 Mbps, the new standard. They gave the example of Netflix, which recommends download speeds of 5 Mbps to stream high-definition video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The letter&rsquo;s authors said they worried increased regulation as a result of the standard would disincentivize telecommunications companies to offer higher speeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barry Orton, a professor emeritus of telecommunications at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that most households have more than one person using the internet at once, which makes faster speeds necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Why are they writing a letter saying don&rsquo;t expand the broadband definition?&quot; said Orton, who helped Feingold&rsquo;s campaign develop its broadband materials. &quot;Because expansion of the broadband definition doesn&rsquo;t help existing providers that are offering less than that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For its part, Johnson&rsquo;s campaign says he supports increased broadband connectivity &mdash; but wants the private sector deliver the services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ron has worked on a bipartisan basis to create an environment where more broadband companies can invest and innovate to provide better internet access and more choice across Wisconsin,&quot; Johnson&rsquo;s campaign said in an April statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger provided two additional letters to support this stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>A 2013 letter signed by Johnson and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, urged the FCC to finalize its plan to distribute funds for deployment of broadband to rural areas.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>A 2014 letter signed by more than 40 senators asked the FCC to carefully update rules governing broadband in rural areas to encourage competition.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So, while the party cited two votes, it did not give a full picture of Johnson&rsquo;s record on the matter. Indeed, there may be multiple ways to achieve the same goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contributions from telecom special interests</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad also claims Johnson&rsquo;s campaign got &quot;nearly $90,000&quot; in contributions from telecommunications special interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Democratic Party of Wisconsin cited OpenSecrets.org, a website that pulls from Federal Election Committee data, which shows Johnson received at least $95,000 in contributions since 2010 from political action committees representing &quot;<a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/industry.php?txt=B09&amp;cycle=2016\">telecom services</a>&quot; companies, including AT&amp;T, Charter and Comcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Democratic Party&rsquo;s radio ad said Johnson &quot;opposes faster broadband internet in small towns&quot; and he &quot;got nearly $90,000 in campaign contributions from the telecom special interests.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson&rsquo;s voting record shows he opposed two particular proposals to grow faster broadband in rural areas and one signed letter to the FCC showed he was against a faster definition of broadband.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But two other letters to the FCC suggest he&rsquo;s in favor of faster rural broadband &mdash; but concerned with its execution. Johnson&rsquo;s campaign has said he supports using the private sector to grow rural broadband.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second part of the claim is on point &mdash; Johnson actually received somewhat more from the industry than the ad claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On balance, we rate the claim Half True.</p> <a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3c81ce84-1d39-472e-ace6-9051b26d8d36\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3c81ce84-1d39-472e-ace6-9051b26d8d36</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-26T11:47:38.596901", "ruling_date": "2016-07-27T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin Democrats claim Ron Johnson opposes faster rural broadband, took money from industry", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-democrats-claim-ron-johnson-opposes-fast", "ruling_link_text": "Dialing up some problems", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><strong>Email exchange and interview with Ron Johnson spokesman Brian Reisinger, July 2016</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Email exchange and interview with Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesman Harry Hartfield, July 2016</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interview with Barry Orton, UW-Madison professor emeritus of telecommunications, July 14, 2016</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interview with Brian Kirsch, networking program chair and instructor, Milwaukee Area Technical College, July 15, 2016</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00141\">Roll call on Amendment 2273</a>, June 20, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00144\">Roll call on Amendment 998</a>, June 10, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/letter_to_fcc_chairman_wheeler_-_broadband_definition.pdf\">Letter to FCC from Johnson and others</a>, January 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Letter to FCC from Johnson and Baldwin, April 11, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-328319A2.pdf\">Letter to FCC from Thune, Klobuchar and others, May 6, 2014</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?type=I&amp;cid=N00032546&amp;newMem=N&amp;recs=0&amp;cycle=2016\">Sen.
