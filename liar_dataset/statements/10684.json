Scott Walker took his presidential ambitions to New Hampshire, he shared a penny-pinching story that would have been right at home in bargain-hunting Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the center of the story: A new sweater, a dollar and Menomonee Falls-based Kohl&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The department store chain is well known for its deep discounts -- ones so deep that the company has <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/kohls-loses-appeal-in-california-false-advertising-lawsuit-b9922979z1-209605461.html\">faced legal challenges over its pricing practices in Kansas, Massachusetts and California.</a> At issue in the California case, for instance, was complaints that the retailer listed &quot;normal&quot; prices for products but never sold them for that price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker likes to point out that shortly after he was married, his wife, Tonette, was mortified because he didn&rsquo;t know the drill at Kohl&rsquo;s. In Concord, N.H., he told the crowd at <a href=\"http://www.wmur.com/politics/raw-video-scott-walker-speaks-in-concord/31797362\">a March 14, 2015 workshop</a> about a &quot;critical mistake&quot; he made while shopping at a Kohl&rsquo;s store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I went to a Kohl&#39;s department store and I bought something for the price it was marked at,&quot; Walker said, adding that he&rsquo;s now been &quot;trained well&quot; about how to shop at Kohl&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So well that he pointed to the brownish-colored sweater he was wearing and declared: &quot;We paid one dollar for it with our Kohl&rsquo;s Cash.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A buck?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, we grant this is not the most important topic in politics today. But we decided to fact check it for two reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, we heard from readers from around the country who thought it was an unbelievable story -- as in, literally impossible to believe. Second, it goes to what has been a major theme of Walker&rsquo;s visits to some of the early primary states -- that he is just an average guy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Wisconsin, voters have long heard about Walker&rsquo;s brown bag lunches and his ham-and-cheese sandwiches have become a fixture on his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottwalker/status/463360162099896321\">Twitter account</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the presidential level, all of this becomes a pointed contrast his far-better heeled GOP rivals, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked a spokeswoman for Walker&rsquo;s exploratory campaign group, <a href=\"http://www.ouramericanrevival.com/\">Our American Revival</a>, about the $1 sweater, we didn&rsquo;t receive a response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we did what any Midwesterner would do, and went bargain hunting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could we score a sweater just like the nifty henley that Walker donned in New Hampshire? And, more importantly, could we do it for next to nothing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottWalker\">Walker indicated on Twitter </a>that he bought the sweater while in the Granite State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He didn&rsquo;t identify the location, but there is a Kohl&rsquo;s in Hooksett, about 13 miles from Concord. We called the store, and an employee in menswear said all of the store&rsquo;s henley sweaters were mixed with other items on clearance racks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on photos of Walker in the sweater, it appears to be a &quot;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=chaps+twisted+button+sweater&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mrIVVZieKoaoyASenYGYCQ&amp;ved=0CEcQsAQ&amp;biw=1279&amp;bih=854#tbm=isch&amp;q=chaps+twisted+button+sweater+walnut&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=mpbfk2UoApIjvM%253A%3B_hM3oEEbAwuKoM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fmedia.kohls.com.edgesuite.net%252Fis%252Fimage%252Fkohls%252F1690151_Walnut_Twist%253Fwid%253D800%2526hei%253D800%2526op_sharpen%253D1%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fanswers.kohls.com%252Fanswers%252F9025%252Fproduct%252F1824110%252Fquestions.htm%253Fsort%253Drecentq%3B800%3B800\">Chaps Twisted Button Mock Sweater</a>&quot; in a color called &quot;walnut twist.&quot; We couldn&rsquo;t find that sweater available on the Kohl&rsquo;s web site, so we visited the Kohl&rsquo;s store in Glendale to paw through the clearance racks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There we found plenty of Chaps sweaters marked between 80 and 90 percent off -- an even deeper cut than the 70% Walker cited when describing the deal. Some of the sweaters we found were originally priced at $70 and marked down to $7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, that&rsquo;s not $1. But Walker did say he used his &quot;Kohl&rsquo;s Cash&quot; -- a coupon of sorts that is generated based on how much a customer purchased in an earlier visit to the store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, he could have easily gotten one for $1 out-of-pocket. We rate the claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, just ask us how much Walker&rsquo;s daily ham sandwich costs.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-04-02T13:01:11.665884", "ruling_date": "2015-04-03T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Gov.
