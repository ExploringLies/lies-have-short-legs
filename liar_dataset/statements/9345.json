Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat in her first term, is a <a href=\"http://www.baldwin.senate.gov/blog/the-time-is-now-to-give-hard-working-americans-a-raise?042914_facebookshare\">vocal supporter</a> of raising the national minimum wage to $10.10 over a three- year period and then indexing it to inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The issue was on her mind May 8, 2014 during an <a href=\"http://www.themic921.com/onair/the-devils-advocates-47215/us-senator-tammy-baldwin-12334523/\">appearance on the Devil&rsquo;s Advocates radio show</a> (92.1 FM in Madison).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin was discussing the importance of a college education for earning better wages and gaining upward mobility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I just had to smile during some of these debates we had on the minimum wage and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll have again,&quot; Baldwin said. &quot;A lot of people pointed to and brushed it aside and said, &lsquo;These are teenagers.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She added: &nbsp;&quot;First of all, they&rsquo;re not. The average person who gets the minimum wage in America is 35 years old. That said, even if it involves a lot of people who are young, when we look at the cost of college, don&rsquo;t we want them to be able to join their parents in helping save some money for that opportunity?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s examine whether Baldwin&rsquo;s correct that &quot;the average person who gets the minimum wage in America is 35 years old.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her press office pointed us to a December 2013 briefing paper by the <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/\">Economic Policy Institute</a>, a liberal think tank that has studied the $10.10 proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The workers who would receive a raise do not fit the stereotypes of low-wage workers: Among affected workers, the average age is 35 years old, nearly 88 percent are at least 20 years old, and more than a third (34.5 percent) are at least 40 years old,&quot; the &nbsp;institute&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://s1.epi.org/files/2014/EPI-1010-minimum-wage.pdf\">paper</a> concluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Barack Obama, who is pushing for $10.10, used the same lines -- and evidence -- less than two weeks before Baldwin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his April 26, 2014 weekly radio address, Obama said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Right now, there&rsquo;s a bill that would boost America&rsquo;s minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. That would lift wages for nearly 28 million Americans across the country. 28 million. And we&rsquo;re not just talking about young people on their first job. The average minimum wage worker is 35 years old. They work hard, often in physically demanding jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National rated Obama&rsquo;s comment about the average age <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-average-minimum-wage-worker-35-y/\">Mostly False</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Baldwin and Obama were trying to counter wage-hike critics who have said that it&rsquo;s primarily teenagers who work in minimum-wage positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April, we rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/20/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/wisconsin-manufacturers-commerce-says-typical-mini/\">Mostly False</a> a claim by the Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce that &quot;typical minimum wage earners in America are teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that by one definition of minimum-wage workers, teenagers make up the largest sub-group compared with other age groupings. But teenagers are less than a third of all minimum wage workers, and hard data is scarce on how many live in middle-class families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin, too, tripped up here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She framed her claim around people currently making the minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the EPI study that put the average age at 35 looked at the larger universe of all workers who would receive a raise from the boost to $10.10. Many are making more than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, but less than $10.10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the EPI research also factored in people currently earning up to $11.10, on the theory that those workers would probably also be given raises if the minimum were set at $10.10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what is the average age of the pool of workers currently at the minimum wage, the group Baldwin mentioned?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David Cooper, who authored the EPI study, put the figure at 30 among those right at the federal minimum, based on his research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not that simple, though, because more than half the U.S. workforce toils in states that have raised the minimum wage above the current federally mandated $7.25, according to Cooper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To address that, Cooper studied the demographics of workers &quot;at or near their effective state minimum wage,&quot; defining that as within 3 percent of the minimum-wage level, Cooper told PolitiFact National in April 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The average age is 31 in that group, Cooper found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldwin&rsquo;s remarks contained an element of truth about the demographics of minimum-wage workers. But the average age of 35 holds for those who would benefit from a change to $10.10, not the group Baldwin spoke of -- current minimum-wage workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate her claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-05-19T17:57:36.560911", "ruling_date": "2014-05-21T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tammy Baldwin says minimum wage workers are 35 years on average", "ruling_headline_slug": "tammy-baldwin-says-minimum-wage-workers-are-35-yea", "ruling_link_text": "Number refers to group who\u2019d gain from $10.10 an hour", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://www.themic921.com/onair/the-devils-advocates-47215/us-senator-tammy-baldwin-12334523/\">Podcast</a>, Devil&rsquo;s Advocates radio, Senator Tammy Baldwin remarks on minimum wage (starts at 4:30 mark), May 8, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with David Cooper, Economic Policy Institute, May 19, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email from press office of Senator Tammy Baldwin, May 14, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2013.pdf\">&quot;Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers, 2013,</a>&quot;
