During even years, a biennial spending plan is adopted. During odd years, the plan is adjusted to address changing needs and to conform to the ebb or flow of revenues because state law requires a balanced budget.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn 2000, the General Assembly passed a two-year plan that complied with then-Gov. Jim Gilmore&rsquo;s signature campaign pledge to phase out the personal property tax on cars. That year, 45 percent of the levy was eliminated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut in 2001, the nation was entering recession and the General Assembly split over Gilmore&rsquo;s insistence that they proceed with the next step of phase out, which would have eliminated 70 percent of the car tax. The House approved the plan; the Senate refused, arguing that the state could not afford the step -- estimated to cost close to $400 million.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe General Assembly adjourned late that February without a budget agreement. It held a special session in May and again did not come to accord. The impasse marked &quot;the first time, the legislature couldn&rsquo;t agree on a budget,&quot; according to a May 13, 2001 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe stalemate played into Gilmore&rsquo;s hands. Under state law, he was allowed to cut spending to keep the two-year budget plan balanced, but he could not appropriate money for new programs. Gilmore, a Republican, sliced $421 million in spending and kept his car tax cut on schedule.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tLater that year, Democrat Mark Warner was elected governor with a stump speech that criticized the political climate in Richmond for being no better than Washington&rsquo;s. And in 2002, the General Assembly capped car tax relief at $950 million a year, which was the cost of the 70 percent Gilmore phased out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s return to Cuccinelli at the Shad Planking. After the speech, Richmond Times-Dispatch columnist Jeff Schapiro reminded him of the 2001 stalemate. &quot;That was before I was in the (Virginia) senate,&quot; said Cuccinelli, who was elected to the General Assembly later that year.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCuccinelli&rsquo;s campaign declined our invitation for additional comments.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;We have never gone a year in Virginia -- ever -- without passing a budget -- ever,&quot; Cuccinelli said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNever, that is, except in 2001.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe rate Cuccinelli&rsquo;s statement False</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-05-04T22:01:31.946006", "ruling_date": "2013-05-06T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Cuccinelli says Virginia legislature has never failed to pass a budget", "ruling_headline_slug": "cuccinelli-says-virginia-legislature-has-never-fai", "ruling_link_text": "Except in 2001", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-33e55e3f-726a-969d-008a-bed1dbba0713\">\r\n\tRichmond Times-Dispatch recording of Ken Cuccinelli&rsquo;s speech at the Shad Planking, April 18, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRichmond Times-Dispatch, video of Ken Cuccinelli at the Shad Planking, April 18, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tVirginia Department of Planning and Budget, <a href=\"http://dpb.virginia.gov/budget/budget.cfm\">&quot;Virginia&rsquo;s budget,&quot;</a> accessed April 30, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tVirginia Department of Planning and Budget, <a href=\"http://dpb.virginia.gov/budget/faq.cfm\">&quot;Frequently asked questions&quot;</a> accessed April 30, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRichmond Times-Dispatch, &quot;Budget Talks Collapse -- Assembly leaves without agreement,&quot; May 10, 2001.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRichmond Times-Dispatch, &quot;Budget impasse meets reality -- museums, labs cope with cuts,&quot; July 1, 2001.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRichmond Times-Dispatch, &quot;Car-tax relief plan put on hold -- Gilmore cites recession, flat growth in state income,&quot; Nov. 16, 2011.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRichmond Times-Dispatch, &quot;Tax fight: Government adrift?&quot; May 13, 2001.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRichmond Times-Dispatch, &quot;Car-tax fight: No exit in sight -- Senate rejects Gilmore plan a fourth time,&quot; May 8, 2001.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRichmond Times-Dispatch, &quot;Budget deal doomed? -- Senate balks at bill passed by delegates,&quot; May 9, 2001.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tVirginian-Pilot, &quot;More budget gridlock may be on the way in 2002 over the car tax,&quot; June 23, 2001.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tVirginian-Pilot, &quot;State&rsquo;s May revenues could prevent more cuts, Gilmore says,&quot; June 15, 2001.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tVirginian-Pilot, &quot;Stymied Va. lawmakers call it quits,&quot; May 10, 2001.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNew York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/us/politics/senate-passes-3-7-trillion-budget-its-first-in-4-years.html?_r=0\">&quot;Senate passes $3.7 billion budget, setting up contentious negotiations,&quot;</a> March 23, 2013.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Attorney General", "false_count": 10, "first_name": "Ken", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 763, "last_name": "Cuccinelli", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "ken-cuccinelli", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Cuccinelli.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/763/", "total_count": 21, "true_count": 3, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-33e55e3f-7265-cfea-1ee0-90d7946acef2\">\r\n\t&quot;We have never gone a year in Virginia -- ever -- without passing a budget -- ever.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech.", "statement_date": "2013-04-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
