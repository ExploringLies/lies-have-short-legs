According to the 2014 <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/exit-polls-2014-voters-112502.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>exit poll</u></a> of voters, 59 percent of those who voted said they weren&rsquo;t happy with Republican leadership in Congress, even as they were handing control of the Senate to the GOP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A meme making its way around social media, sent to PolitiFact by a reader, captured the frustration many Americans felt. The meme said, &quot;11% approval ratings. 96.4% re-elected&quot; -- in other words, Congress has 11 percent approval ratings, yet 96.4 percent of incumbent lawmakers were re-elected in 2014. The text was superimposed over a photograph of the House chamber in the Capitol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether that was true, so we took a look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Does Congress have 11 percent approval ratings?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the meme features a picture of the House chamber, the most common polling question refers to Congress generally, rather than the House specifically, so we looked at Congress&rsquo; approval ratings overall. We found congressional approval scores from October 2014 from five different pollsters on the poll-archive website <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/CongJob.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>PollingReport.com</u></a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Fox News: &quot;Do you approve or disapprove of the job Congress is doing?&quot; 13 percent said &quot;approve.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; CBS News: &quot;Do you approve or disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job?&quot; 14 percent said &quot;approve.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; CNN/ORC: &quot;Do you approve or disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job?&quot; 13 percent said &quot;approve.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; ABC News/<em>Washington Post</em>: &quot;Do you approve or disapprove of the way the U.S. Congress is doing its job?&quot; 20 percent said &quot;approve.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; NBC News/<em>Wall Street Journal</em>: &quot;In general, do you approve or disapprove of the job that Congress is doing?&quot; 12 percent said &quot;approve.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That averages out to 14 percent -- slightly higher than 11 percent, but in the same, miserable ballpark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Were 96.4 percent of congressional incumbents re-elected?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be consistent with the polling, which covers Congress broadly, we&rsquo;ll lump together the incumbent winning percentages in both the House and Senate. There are a few contests still to be decided, but there are enough settled that we can make a pretty close count.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the House, we counted 390 incumbents who ran on Election Day. Of those, four haven&rsquo;t had their races called as of Nov. 10, so we&rsquo;ll set them aside. Of the remaining 386 incumbents, 373 won, for a winning percentage of 96.6 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you add in three incumbents who ran but lost in primaries, the incumbent winning percentage drops to 95.9 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, in the Senate, 23 out of 26 incumbents won, with one more (Alaska&rsquo;s Mark Begich, a Democrat) trailing in a race that has not yet been called, and another (Louisiana&rsquo;s Mary Landrieu, also a Democrat) heading into a runoff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t include Begich and Landrieu, the combined House-Senate incumbent winning percentage is 95.4 percent. If you do include them, it falls slightly to 95 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of these percentages are exceedingly close to the meme&rsquo;s stated 96.4 percent, and they&rsquo;re a moving target due to late-called races. So we won&rsquo;t quibble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meme said that Congress has 11 percent approval ratings, yet 96.4 percent of incumbent lawmakers were re-elected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found small differences in the actual percentages -- Congress had roughly a 14 percent approval rate, and the incumbent re-election rate may be as low as 95 percent -- but the point of the meme is solid. Voters hold Congress in low regard, yet they re-elect almost everyone. So we rate the claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<script src=\"http://www.politifact.com/media/js/politifactwidget5.js\"></script>", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-11-10T18:05:44.656768", "ruling_date": "2014-11-11T16:56:06", "ruling_headline": "Congress has 11% approval ratings but 96% incumbent reelection rate, meme says", "ruling_headline_slug": "congress-has-11-approval-ratings-96-incumbent-re-e", "ruling_link_text": "We hate 'em, but we keep voting 'em in", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Social media meme sent to PolitiFact</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pollingreport.com, <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/CongJob.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Congressional job rating</u></a>, accessed Nov. 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN election results, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/2014/results/race/senate\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2014 midterm House elections</u></a>, accessed Nov. 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN election results, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/election/2014/results/race/senate\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2014 midterm Senate elections</u></a>, accessed Nov. 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Roll Call</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/politics/casualtylist.html/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Casualty List: 113th Congress (2013-2014)</u></a>,&quot; accessed Nov. 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Politico</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/exit-polls-2014-voters-112502.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Exit polls 2014: Voters hate everyone</u></a>,&quot; Nov. 4, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 14, "current_job": "Social media posting", "false_count": 18, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 1486, "last_name": "Facebook posts", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "facebook-posts", "pants_count": 37, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Facebook_icon_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1486/", "total_count": 101, "true_count": 6, "website": "http://www.facebook.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Congress has 11 percent approval ratings, yet 96.4 percent of incumbent lawmakers were re-elected in 2014.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a meme on social media", "statement_date": "2014-11-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 254, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/254/", "subject": "Congress", "subject_slug": "congress", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/6/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
