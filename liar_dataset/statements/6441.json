The study says that under the presumptive Republican presidential candidate&rsquo;s proposals, wealthy taxpayers pay fewer taxes and middle- and lower-income taxpayers pay more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The non-partisan organization found that Romney would raise taxes on the average middle class family by $2,000 to pay for $5 trillion in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires,&quot; the committee said in an Aug. 1 news release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Democrats are right about the $2,000 tax hike on the average middle-class family, but they&rsquo;re wrong in citing &quot;$5 trillion in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.&quot; Those wealthy taxpayers would get a tax break, but not that much.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s explain the purpose behind the study.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney has proposed various tax cuts, including a 20 percent reduction in all federal income tax rates. But Romney&rsquo;s plan also allows certain tax benefits for low-income households to expire.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose changes would mean lower taxes at most income levels -- but that&rsquo;s before the candidate&rsquo;s plan is paid for. The Romney campaign has not specified how the plan would offset that tax revenue loss, but the Tax Policy Center study gives it a shot.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn short, those tax cuts would require eliminating or reducing certain tax deductions and write-offs, according to the study. Those items include mortgage interest deductions and education-related tax credits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, for wealthy taxpayers, the cost of losing those tax loopholes is less than the money gained from the tax cuts. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re left with a net tax break.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut for middle- and lower-income folks, it&rsquo;s the other way around. They stand to lose more in tax loopholes than gain by the tax cuts, leaving them with a greater tax bill at the end of the day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the Democrats&rsquo; claim accurately makes that overall point, but wrongly compares the $2,000 and $5 trillion figures. Think of it as an apples-to-oranges comparison.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter factoring in eliminating or reducing the tax loopholes, the average tax hike in 2015 would be about $2,000 for taxpayers making less than $200,000 a year, who also have children.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the $5 trillion represents the potential tax cuts over a 10-year period before you account for eliminating or reducing those loopholes. Higher-income taxpayers would end up with a net tax break, but the total savings would be far less than $5 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the number Democrats should have cited: taxpayers with incomes exceeding $1 million, on average, would get a roughly $87,000 net tax break in 2015. Take away those tax loopholes, and wealthy taxpayers would still get that amount.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s also worth noting that Democrats are wrong to suggest only &quot;millionaires and billionaires&quot; would benefit from Romney&rsquo;s plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose wealthy taxpayers would receive the greatest net tax savings, but other average taxpayers making more than $200,000 would benefit as well. For instance, taxpayers earning between $200,000 and $500,000, on average, would receive a net tax break of roughly $1,800.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a news release, the committee claimed the Tax Policy Center &quot;found that Romney would raise taxes on the average middle class family by $2,000 to pay for $5 trillion in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut those two figures don&rsquo;t relate to one another. The $2,000 tax hike accounts for eliminating or reducing the tax deductions and write-offs that pay for Romney&rsquo;s plan, but the $5 trillion does not. The more appropriate comparison would be the average net tax break of about $87,000 for those wealthy taxpayers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, the Democrats&rsquo; overall point is correct: the study shows that high-income taxpayers would receive a tax break, while middle- and lower-income taxpayers pay higher taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/08/politifact_nj_mitt_romney_tax.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-10T13:02:58.880224", "ruling_date": "2012-08-12T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Mitt Romney\u2019s tax cut proposal blasted by New Jersey Democrats for using $2,000 middle-class tax hike to cover $5 trillion in tax cuts for the rich", "ruling_headline_slug": "mitt-romneys-tax-cut-proposal-blasted-new-jersey-d", "ruling_link_text": "Numbers don't match", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNew Jersey Democratic State Committee, <a href=\"http://njdems.org/index.php/news/article_new/new_jersey_families_cant_afford_christie_and_romney\">New Jersey Families Can&rsquo;t Afford Christie and Romney</a>, Aug. 1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Policy Center, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/1001628-Base-Broadening-Tax-Reform.pdf\">On The Distributional Effects Of Base-Broadening Income Tax Reform</a>, Aug. 1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/03/barack-obama/obama-romney-would-cut-millionaires-taxes/\">Mitt Romney would cut millionaires&rsquo; taxes, Barack Obama says</a>, Aug. 3, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/07/barack-obama/mitt-romney-would-add-trillions-deficit-while-obam/\">Mitt Romney would add &quot;trillions&quot; to the deficit while Barack Obama would &quot;cut the deficit by $4 trillion,&quot; says Obama TV ad</a>, Aug. 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCenter on Budget and Policy Priorites, <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3658\">Romney Budget Proposals Would Require Massive Cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and Other Programs</a>, May 21, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMitt Romney campaign website, <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/blogs/mitts-view/2012/02/restore-americas-promise-more-jobs-less-debt-smaller-government\">Restore America&rsquo;s Promise: More Jobs, Less Debt, Smaller Government</a>, Feb. 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tForbes.com, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbarro/2012/02/22/quick-thoughts-on-the-romney-tax-plan/\">Romney Plan is a Huge Tax Cut</a>, Feb. 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Policy Center, <a href=\"http://taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/Romney-plan.cfm\">The Romney Plan (Updated)</a>, accessed Aug. 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Washington Post, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/taxes-taxes/2012/08/07/2f38d896-e07e-11e1-8fc5-a7dcf1fc161d_blog.html\">Taxes, Taxes!</a>, Aug. 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFactCheck.org, <a href=\"http://factcheck.org/2012/08/romneys-impossible-tax-promise/\">Romney&rsquo;s Impossible Tax Promise</a>, Aug. 3, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWashington Post&rsquo;s Fact Checker, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/a-tough-new-obama-ad-that----surprise----is-accurate/2012/08/02/gJQAuigQSX_blog.html\">A tough new Obama ad that &mdash; surprise!
