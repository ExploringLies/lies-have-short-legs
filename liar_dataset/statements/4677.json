Blankfein.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe sign read: &quot;Minimum wage = $16,000/year CEO-Goldman Sachs (Lloyd Blankfein) $16,000/Hour.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt goes without saying that Goldman&rsquo;s CEO earns piles more money than most Americans, never mind Rhode Island&rsquo;s minimum-wage workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEver since the New York investment bank accepted a $10-billion government bailout during the financial crisis in 2008, Goldman Sachs has made national headlines for its super-sized executive compensation packages.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we had our doubts about whether Blankfein, Goldman&rsquo;s chief executive, actually earned in one hour what a minimum wage worker in Rhode Island earned in an entire year. So we decided to check it out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The facts</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.minimum-wage.us/states/Rhode_Island\">minimum wage in Rhode Island</a> is $7.40 per hour, so simple math shows that someone who works 40 hours per week for 52 weeks (or 2,080 hours) will earn $15,392 a year. (The minimum wage was the same in 2010 as this year. Many minimum wage workers don&rsquo;t get benefits, unlike CEOs. But we&rsquo;ll get to that later.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe protest sign said $16,000, which is pretty close.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut calculating the pay of chief executives is more complicated because a large share of their compensation is typically in the form of stock options, pension contributions and other non-cash payments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2010, Goldman reported it paid Blankfein a salary of $600,000 plus a bonus of $5.4 million, for a total of $6 million, <a href=\"http://www.goldmansachs.at/investor-relations/financials/current/proxy-statements/2011-proxy-statement.pdf\">according to its 2011 proxy statement</a>, the most recent available data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s 375 times more than a minimum age worker would earn in Rhode Island. But it&rsquo;s a mere $2,885 an hour, not $16,000. (We&rsquo;re basing this calculation on a 40-hour work week.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut wait, there&rsquo;s more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBesides his salary and bonus, the company reported that it gave Blankfein $12.6 million in restricted stock, boosting his annual compensation to $18.6 million. If he worked 40 hours per week, his hourly rate would amount to $8,942. And that&rsquo;s without benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGoldman also paid Blankfein $464,067 in 401(k) matching contributions, term life insurance premiums, medical and dental premium payments, long-term disability insurance premiums, life insurance premiums and perks such as his company car and driver. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(The protesters might have mentioned that the $185,000 Goldman paid for Blankfein&rsquo;s car and driver last year is more than 3&frac12; times <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/statemedian/index.html\">Rhode Island&rsquo;s median household income in 2010</a>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn all, Blankfein&rsquo;s compensation in 2010 totaled &nbsp;about $19.06 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut once again, simple math shows that the estimated cash value of his compensation that year is $9,165 an hour -- not $16,000 an hour as the protest sign declared. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Occupy Providence protest sign was close when it stated that the minimum wage in Rhode Island is $16,000 a year (it&rsquo;s actually just under $15,400). And its point -- that CEOs such as Blankfein make enormous sums of money while people at the bottom of the economic ladder make almost nothing &nbsp;-- is well taken. But the claim that Goldman Sachs&rsquo; CEO earned $16,000 an hour was way off. &nbsp;We rate it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">False</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
