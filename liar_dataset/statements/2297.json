Heath asked DeWine if he was concerned about trailing Democratic Attorney General Richard Cordray in fundraising. Cordray reported he had $3.5 million at the end of July, while DeWine, a former U.S. senator, had $2.1 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter explaining that recent campaign finance reports showed the fundraising gap narrowing, DeWine turned the focus back onto Cordray, insinuating that he is a tool of the Democratic party and labor union bosses with a much narrower base of support.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The good thing I think is that we are receiving money from so many more people,&quot; DeWine said. &quot;His (Cordray) money is coming almost exclusively from the party, labor unions, and special counsel that he has given business to.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSurely, Cordray has received donations from the state party, labor unions and lawyers who got special contracts that are routinely doled out by the attorney general&rsquo;s office. But is it &quot;almost exclusively&quot; from those sources? And can DeWine really lay claim to a much broader grassroots fundraising base?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt sounded like a perfect job for PolitiFact, so we rolled up our sleeves, printed out a stack of campaign finance reports from 2009 and 2010 and got to work with multiple highlighters at the ready.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe easiest part to figure out was the total number of donations each candidate received. DeWine was absolutely right about getting money from &quot;so many more people.&quot; He got 4,811 individual donations compared to 1,529 for Cordray through the July 2010 reporting period. Clearly, DeWine has a much wider donation base.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis is fueled in part by DeWine having a lot more micro-donors &mdash; the Republican had 428 people who gave $10 bucks or less while Cordray only had 43 in the last two years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOverall, Cordray has raised about $3.28 million, with the biggest single source coming from money from county and state parties which totals about $1.25 million&mdash;about 38 percent of his fundraising total. Most of that $1.25 million came from the state party coffers which kicked in about $1.15 million. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd -- just as DeWine had surmised on the television program -- labor unions accounted for another big chunk of change. Cordray has received about $500,000 from Big Labor&mdash;which works out to be about 15 percent of his $3.28 million pile. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe trickiest part was to try to figure out how many folks who got special counsel contracts from Cordray&rsquo;s office also gave money to his campaign. To figure this out, we asked the attorney general&rsquo;s office for a list of lawyers with special counsel contracts, as well as those approved to do collections for his office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt turns out that a number of firms with contracts did contribute &mdash; a total of almost $195,000 by our count &mdash; or about 6 percent of what Cordray has raised. (To be fair, a number of folks with special counsel contracts haven&rsquo;t given anything at all to Cordray.) Leading the way are the attorneys for Calfee, Halter &amp; Griswold. Employees from that Cleveland-based firm have donated $24,350.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCalfee, Halter &amp; Griswold has contracts that could be worth up to $1.13 million working primarily on patent matters for Cleveland State University, Ohio State University, Ohio University, Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine as well as the Department of Development.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAdd it up and here&rsquo;s what you get: State and county Democratic Party accounts, labor unions and law firms with special contracts gave about 60 percent of the money raised by Cordray during this election cycle. That&rsquo;s a clear majority of the dollars raised by Cordray but a far cry from &quot;almost exclusively&quot; providing the funds, as DeWine had claimed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo while DeWine was absolutely right in saying that he has a wider base, he missed the mark in claiming that Cordray&rsquo;s dough came &quot;almost exclusively&quot; from a trio of sources.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs a result, we rate his claim to be Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/08/mike_dewine_says_attorney_gene.html\" target=\"blank\">Comment on this item</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-30T10:45:00.391883", "ruling_date": "2010-08-30T10:45:00", "ruling_headline": "Mike DeWine says Attorney General Richard Cordray\u2019s campaign is funded \u201calmost exclusively\u201d by party, labor unions and special counsels", "ruling_headline_slug": "mike-dewine-says-attorney-general-richard-cordrays", "ruling_link_text": "Cordray rakes it in from that trio, but that\u2019s not all", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tList of law firms with special counsel contracts provided by Ted Hart, spokesman for Ohio Attorney General Office on Aug. 24, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tONN, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPZ5NVYRaEI&amp;feature=player_embedded\">interview with Mike DeWine</a>, Aug. 15, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www2.sos.state.oh.us/pls/cfonline/f?p=119:1:4480201656718073\">Campaign finance database</a>, Ohio secretary of state</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "Ohio attorney general", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Mike", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 579, "last_name": "DeWine", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "mike-dewine", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mike-dewine-mug.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/579/", "total_count": 14, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tThe DeWine campaign is &quot;receiving money from so many more people.&nbsp;(Cordray&#39;s) money is coming almost exclusively from the party, labor unions, and special counsel that he has given business to.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a television interview", "statement_date": "2010-08-15", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Richard", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 531, "last_name": "Cordray", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "richard-cordray", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifactohio-richard-cordray___.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/531/", "total_count": 7, "true_count": 1, "website": "https://cordrayforohio.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
