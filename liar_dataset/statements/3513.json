It goes for services such as defense, education, health and housing. In contrast, mandatory spending is used for entitlement programs with required levels of funding -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRay Allen, a political adviser to Cantor, said the congressman was referring to non-defense discretionary spending. He also said Cantor, in discussing spending &quot;over the last two years&quot; is referring to a period that begins with Obama&rsquo;s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact is no stranger to the set of numbers Cantor used. They also have been cited by Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., chairman of the House Budget Committee. The figures, culled from the Congressional Budget Office, can be traced to a Ryan news release last June.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlthough several budget experts we spoke to quibbled about the exact figures Cantor used, the raw numbers are not really in dispute. His computations of those numbers, however, have problems.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe numbers show non-defense discretionary spending rose from $434 billion in fiscal 2008 to $537 billion in fiscal 2010. That&rsquo;s a 23.7 percent jump -- consistent with the &quot;20-some percent&quot; increase Cantor claimed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCantor does not provide an historical perspective to those numbers, so we will. In the eight federal budgets approved during Republican George W. Bush&rsquo;s administration -- non-defense discretionary spending increased by an average 9.6 percent each year. During the first two years of the Obama administration, it has grown by an annual average of 11.9 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNon-defense discretionary spending adds up to about one-sixth of expenditures in the federal budget. Even if it was completely eliminated, the nation would still run an estimated $820 billion deficit this fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s move to the $787 billion stimulus package, approved by the Democratic-controlled Congress in 2009 with hopes that a federal injection of money would jolt the economy out of recession. &nbsp;A third of the money -- $259 billion -- was appropriated for discretionary uses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCantor adds all of the $259 billion to the $537 billion in discretionary spending for 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat gives him a total of $796 billion in discretionary spending for fiscal 2010. And if you compare it to the $434 billion in 2008, it&rsquo;s an 83.4 percent increase -- consistent with the &quot;over 80 percent&quot; he claimed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut there are a few catches.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, not everyone agrees it&rsquo;s appropriate to include stimulus money in the calculation since it could be considered one-time emergency spending -- not part of the budget base. Cantor seemed to acknowledge that point by saying, &quot;<em>If </em>you put the stimulus in, it&rsquo;s over 80 percent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also wondered why Cantor counted the $257 billion in 2010. After all, the stimulus was approved in 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen said Cantor lumped the stimulus money into fiscal 2010 because that&rsquo;s the year most of it was spent. &quot;When something passed is irrelevant,&quot; Allen said. &quot;What matters is when it&rsquo;s spent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeveral budget experts said Allen&rsquo;s point is valid. So we went back to the spread sheets and encountered a problem: We found no one, including Cantor, who could produce data showing the exact yearly expenditures&nbsp;of non-discretionary stimulus funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we did find two tables that suggest Cantor&rsquo;s contention that all of the money was spent in 2010 is faulty. A 2009 analysis of the stimulus bill by the Congressional Budget Office said the discretionary money would be doled out over a number of years, with 36 percent being spent in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe CBO published an <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12039\">updated estimate of stimulus spending </a>in January. It indicates that about 34 percent of the &quot;budgetary effects&quot; of the discretionary portion came in 2010. To assume that obligated money has been spent is incorrect.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo let&rsquo;s suppose 35 percent is the actual figure. That would mean&nbsp;Cantor, under his formula, should have applied only $90 billion of stimulus to last year&rsquo;s discretionary spending total -- not the full $257 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt would mean discretionary spending, if you include the stimulus, increased 44 percent during the first two years of the Obama administration -- far shy of the &quot;over 80 percent&quot; Cantor claimed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen disputed our calculus, saying only a tiny portion remained unspent at the end of 2010. He referred to CBO documents from earlier this year saying all but about $5 billion in discretionary stimulus money has been &quot;obligated.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe CBO defines obligations as &quot;a legally binding commitment by the federal government that will result in outlays, immediately or in the future.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tContrary to the claim of Cantor&rsquo;s camp, the CBO documents do not prove most of the money was spent in 2010. One of the reports, in fact, says &quot;most of the discretionary funding provided by ARRA (the stimulus) has been obligated, although outlays may occur in 2011 and later years.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCantor said discretionary spending has &quot;increased over 20-some percent in two years if you don&rsquo;t include the stimulus. If you put in the stimulus, it&rsquo;s over 80 percent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWithout the stimulus, discretionary spending increased 23.7 percent. So is Cantor right on that part.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the majority leader runs into trouble when he starts counting discretionary stimulus funds.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCantor generates his high percentage by lumping in all of the $257 million approved for discretionary stimulus use into 2010 spending. CBO reports indicate that only slightly more than a third of the discretionary stimulus was spent last year. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat suggests that when you add in the stimulus, discretionary spending increased 44 percent during the first two years of the Obama administration -- not &quot;over 80 percent&quot; as Cantor says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCantor&rsquo;s statement is half right and half wrong. We&rsquo;ll split the difference and rate it Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-01T12:55:25.677286", "ruling_date": "2011-04-01T12:54:52", "ruling_headline": "Eric Cantor says discretionary spending up 20 percent in 2 years, 80 percent with stimulus", "ruling_headline_slug": "eric-cantor-says-discretionary-spending-20-percent", "ruling_link_text": "Cantor's math not quite right", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tEric Cantor, <a href=\"http://gretawire.blogs.foxnews.com/house-majority-leader-eric-cantor-uncut/\">Fox News interview with Greta Van Susterin</a>, March 17, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews with Ray Allen, political adviser to Cantor, March 23-29, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Megan Whittemore, deputy press secretary for Cantor, March 22, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFactWisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/07/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-us-discretionary-spending-increased/\">Paul Ryan says U.S. discretionary spending increased 84 percent in the last two years</a>, Nov. 7, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFactWisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/27/paul-ryan/us-rep-paul-ryan-says-obama-increased-spending-nea/\">U.S. Rep.
