The only difference between Senator Clinton's health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated -- forced -- them to get health care.\"\n<p>\n The distinction between the two plan's is that Clinton's has a mandate requiring people to get health insurance; Obama's does not. Is it fair to say a plan is universal without a mandate?\n</p>\n<p>\n There's little doubt that Obama's plan would significantly expand health care coverage. In its structure, it's not that different from Clinton's: Both leave in place employer-based private insurance; they increase access to Medicaid and SCHIP programsl they subsidize premiums for some employers; and they create pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance.\n</p>\n<p>\n But universal? Obama's plan \"would get close to universal coverage,\" said Sara Collins, a health care expert with The Commonwealth Fund. \"It's clear his goal is universal coverage,\" she said, noting that Obama's plan includes a mandate for children.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"But I think to get all people covered, he would have to mandate that adults get it, too.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n We think Obama is pushing the envelope calling a plan without a mandate \"universal.\" For that reason, we rate his claim Barely True.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
