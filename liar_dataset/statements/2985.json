That means the earmarks are not likely to be funded, said <a href=\"http://www.taxpayer.net/about.php?action=staff#ryan\">Ryan Alexander</a>, president of <a href=\"http://www.taxpayer.net/\">Taxpayers for Common Sense</a> (and a University of Wisconsin Law School graduate).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNevertheless, let&rsquo;s find out whether McCain&rsquo;s claim was on target.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe 2008 presidential candidate said his source on the earmarks he highlighted was <a href=\"http://endingspending.com/\">EndingSpending.com</a>, which has a <a href=\"http://endingspending.com/map-2011/\">2011 earmarks database</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe database was assembled by three Washington, D.C., organizations: <a href=\"http://endingspending.com/about/taxpayers-against-earmarks-leadership/\">Taxpayers Against Earmarks</a>, led by Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts; Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group; and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonwatch.com/about/\">WashingtonWatch.com</a>, which is run by a staff member of the Cato Institute, a libertarian research foundation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur check of the database found that an earmark request for <a href=\"http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/ED_70822.html\">$300,000 for potato pest </a><a href=\"http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/ED_70822.html\">management</a> in Wisconsin was made by U.S. Rep. Dave Obey (D-Wausau).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObey, who decided not to seek re-election in November after 41 years in Congress, was regarded as one of the most powerful members as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. He&rsquo;ll be replaced in January by Republican Sean Duffy, a former prosecutor and lumberjack athlete.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, did Obey request the potato money?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYes, said Ellis Brachman, spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee. He referred us to Obey&rsquo;s official website, pointing out that members of Congress are required to post their earmark requests.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObey&rsquo;s site does not label his requests as earmarks, but rather &quot;Wisconsin projects submitted for consideration in FY 2011 appropriations.&quot; If you click there on Obey&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.obey.house.gov/\">home page</a>, you get a list of his more than <a href=\"http://www.obey.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=897:wisconsin-appropriations&amp;catid=41\">80 earmark requests</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong them: $36 million for studies of high-speed passenger rail between Madison and the Twin Cities; $2.5 million to replace the Bad River Tribal Youth Center in Ashland; and millions of dollars for water or waste water system improvements in communities including Cadott, Elcho and Unity. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for Obey&rsquo;s potato pest request, here&rsquo;s the summary:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Recipient</strong>: University of Wisconsin College of Agriculture and Life Sciences<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Address</strong>: 1450 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Amount:</strong> $300,000<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Description</strong>: Funding will help promote the development and adoption of bio-intensive integrated pest management practices to reduce or eliminate the use of pesticides, enhance habitat quality, develop marketplace incentives for ecologically-produced potatoes and maintain economically viable farming operations in the fragile central sands region of Northern Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObey was just renewing the potato earmark request. He won $849,000 for the same earmark from 2008 to 2010, according to <a href=\"http://taxpayer.net/search_by_category.php?action=view&amp;proj_id=2789&amp;category=&amp;type=Project\">earmarks </a><a href=\"http://taxpayer.net/search_by_category.php?action=view&amp;proj_id=2789&amp;category=&amp;type=Project\">databases</a> kept by Taxpayers for Common Sense.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJust how important are potatoes in Wisconsin? The state ranks third in potato production, behind Idaho and Washington, according to the <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinpotatoes.com/\">Wisconsin Potato &amp; Vegetable Growers Association</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong the threats to Wisconsin potatoes is the Colorado potato beetle, which isn&rsquo;t easily killed by predator bugs. It is <a href=\"http://www.entomology.wisc.edu/vegento/xtras/proc/2009_newInsecticide.pdf\">&quot;the most serious insect pest&quot;</a> found on commercially produced potatoes in the central sands area, according to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Entomology.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered why McCain said the potato pest management request was for $277,000, while the database he cited and Obey put the figure at $300,000. McCain&rsquo;s office didn&rsquo;t reply to our question. However, a <a href=\"http://coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/rightnow?ContentRecord_id=e07a0af9-c677-4b5a-814f-a40c8ac13f74\">&quot;working database&quot;</a> of 2011 earmarks maintained by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), indicates the request was reduced to $277,000 before being put into the bill that was ultimately abandoned.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObey&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t the only potato pest management earmark request. Maine&rsquo;s congressional delegation asked for $450,000 for its program, according to the Coburn database.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOK, let&rsquo;s return to McCain&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCiting a database, the Arizona senator said an earmark request had been made for $277,000 for potato pest management in Wisconsin. The database shows the request was made by Obey, the outgoing congressman. He doesn&rsquo;t dispute it. (But it&rsquo;s entirely possible his office considers us a pest on this issue.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate McCain&rsquo;s statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-12-17T20:30:19.537886", "ruling_date": "2010-12-19T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "John McCain says a federal spending bill included a $277,000 request for potato pest management in Wisconsin", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-mccain-says-federal-spending-bill-included-27", "ruling_link_text": "McCain hit this earmark right on the nose", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact.com, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/18/richard-lugar/richard-lugar-says-ending-earmarks-wont-save-money/\">Richard Lugar says ending earmarks won&rsquo;t save money</a>, Nov. 18, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFactWisconsin.com, <a href=\"http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/01/dave-obey/us-rep-dave-obey-says-earmarks-ban-would-greatly-w/\">U.S. Rep.
