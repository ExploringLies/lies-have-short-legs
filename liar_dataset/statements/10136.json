Carol Shea-Porter and her GOP challenger, former Rep. Frank Guinta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the narration of the ad, which was paid for by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House Republicans&rsquo; election arm:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Carol Shea-Porter votes with Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s Democrats 95 percent of the time. More spending, higher taxes. We need a change. As mayor, Frank Guinta brought a tax cap to Manchester and balanced four straight budgets. Frank will take on both parties. Cut spending, fight for a balanced budget, and restore Medicare to protect our seniors. Independent New Hampshire values, that&rsquo;s Frank Guinta.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But is the comparison in partisan voting patterns really that stark? The answer is no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their records are easy to compare, because Shea-Porter and Guinta have traded off ownership of the seat over the past several election cycles. Shea-Porter was elected to the House in 2006 and 2008, lost to Guinta in 2010, then beat him in a rematch in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad footnotes Shea-Porter&rsquo;s 95 percent partisan voting record to a <em>Washington Post </em><a href=\"http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/113/house/members/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>vote study</u></a>. That shows that Shea-Porter did indeed vote with her party 95 percent of the time in the current Congress. A similar <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/memberchild_votestudy-26142?13\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>study</u></a> by <em>Congressional Quarterly</em> shows Shea-Porter&rsquo;s partisan unity score ranging between 95 percent and 98 percent each year during her congressional career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the ad has a point that Shea-Porter has loyally voted the party line in the House. The problem with the ad is in suggesting that Guinta has done the opposite. He hasn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same <em>Post </em><a href=\"http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/112/house/members/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>tally</u></a> shows that in Guinta&rsquo;s term in Congress -- covering 2011 and 2012 -- he voted with his party 96 percent of the time. That&rsquo;s barely distinguishable from how Shea Porter voted with her party. The <em>CQ </em><a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/member-32617?6#VOTINGSTUDIES\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>tally</u></a> shows much the same: Guinta had a 97 percent partisan unity score in 2011 and 95 percent in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NRCC spokesman Ian Prior countered with two arguments. First, he said that if Guinta had served as Manchester mayor with a &quot;my-party-is-100-percent-right attitude, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to implement a tax cap (or) balance four straight city budgets.&quot; Second, he said that Shea-Porter&rsquo;s votes that make up that 95 percent &quot;are out of touch with her district and show that she puts her own liberal agenda ahead of her district.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both points have merit but are far from bulletproof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Prior&rsquo;s first point, city-level policymaking tends to be more technocratic and shaped less by the national political partisanship that drives Congress. In the exact comparison between the two candidates -- how they have voted in Congress -- they have both voted in virtual partisan lockstep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On his second point, that Shea-Porter&rsquo;s votes are out of step with the district, we&rsquo;ll just note that the district voted for Obama for president not once but twice. It&rsquo;s possible that voters have grown disgusted with his agenda since his 2012 reelection. We&rsquo;ll soon find out: That&rsquo;s what elections are for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NRCC ad says that Shea-Porter &quot;votes with Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s Democrats 95 percent of the time,&quot; but Guinta &quot;will take on both parties&quot; and has &quot;independent New Hampshire values.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty stark comparison -- yet by the most apples-to-apples measurement of how both candidates have voted in Congress, Guinta scored a 96 percent partisan unity with Republicans during his term in Congress, which is hardly evidence of a big contrast. We rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-24T12:16:24.699873", "ruling_date": "2014-10-24T14:25:33", "ruling_headline": "NRCC ad says Carol Shea-Porter is a partisan Democrat, Frank Guinta is \"independent\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "nrcc-ad-says-carol-shea-porter-partisan-democrat-f", "ruling_link_text": "His partisan-voting score is even higher", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>National Republican Congressional Committee, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pAxZjE3PTE&amp;feature=youtu.be\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Change</u></a>&quot; (ad), Oct. 24, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, vote study for Carol Shea-Porter, accessed Oct. 24, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, vote study for Frank Guinta, accessed Oct. 24, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Congressional Quarterly</em>, vote study for Carol Shea-Porter, accessed Oct. 24, 2014 (CQ subscribers only)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Congressional Quarterly</em>, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/member-32617?6#VOTINGSTUDIES\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>vote study for Frank Guinta</u></a>, accessed Oct. 24, 2014 (CQ subscribers only)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Ian Prior, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, Oct. 24, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 20, "current_job": "", "false_count": 12, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "", "id": 121, "last_name": "National Republican Congressional Committee", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "national-republican-congressional-committee", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/Logo_NRC_Elephant.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/121/", "total_count": 58, "true_count": 4, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Rep.
