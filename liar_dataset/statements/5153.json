It raises several examples from Romney&rsquo;s abortion record, including this one: that he &quot;put Planned Parenthood on a state medical board but failed to put a pro-life group on the same board.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to look further.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The board and what it does</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad cites <a href=\"http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2006/Chapter58\">the text</a> of the far-reaching Massachusetts health care law Romney signed in 2006 when he was governor, as well as the website <a href=\"http://prolifeprofiles.com/romney\">ProLifeProfiles.com</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong other things, the law establishes the MassHealth Payment Policy Advisory Board and says it shall have &quot;one member appointed by Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts.&quot; It also includes two heads of state agencies plus members from the mental health field, a hospital association, aging services and other areas. It does not specify that an abortion opponent be appointed.</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe governor of Massachusetts gets to appoint two of the 14 board members. When Romney was governor, he appointed Deborah Enos, president of Neighborhood Health Plan, a Medicaid managed care organization, and Bob Moran, an expert in payment methodologies at the University of Massachusetts. (Both are named in this <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/284424-romney-report.html\">implementation report</a> from 2006.) It&rsquo;s true that neither of them represents an anti-abortion group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe problem with the Gingrich ad&#39;s claim, however, is that the board&rsquo;s job is to review state Medicaid reimbursement rates -- it does not address abortion policy at all.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It has nothing to do with saying what they&rsquo;ll cover, what they won&rsquo;t cover&quot; in abortion services, said Anne Fox, president of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, an organization opposed to abortion.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\tWe also reached out to NARAL Pro-Choice America, which advocates for legal abortion, for its take on the matter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSpokesman Ted Miller responded that the group&rsquo;s position &quot;is that the Massachusetts healthcare plan enacted during former Gov. Romney&rsquo;s tenure replaced a program that already covered abortion. Thus, Romney should not get credit for improving women&#39;s access to abortion in Massachusetts.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrich&rsquo;s ad argues that Romney, after changing his position on abortion to &quot;pro-life,&quot; made governing decisions contrary to that stance. One example, according to the ad: He appointed Planned Parenthood to a state medical board but didn&rsquo;t also appoint a pro-life group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the board the ad refers to was created as part of Massachusetts&rsquo; health care overhaul, which the Legislature passed and which Romney signed, and its function is to review Medicaid reimbursement rates. The law also specifies where 12 of the board&#39;s 14 members must come from, including one member appointed by Planned Parenthood. It&#39;s true that Romney didn&rsquo;t appoint any abortion foes to the board -- but the board doesn&rsquo;t deal with abortion or have any say in what abortion services are covered by state-subsidized insurance policies. So that claim is correct but leaves out an important detail. Our ruling: Half True.</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-17T14:14:46.501517", "ruling_date": "2012-01-20T14:05:18", "ruling_headline": "Gingrich ad says Mitt Romney appointed Planned Parenthood to a medical board but not an anti-abortion group", "ruling_headline_slug": "Gingrich-ad-says-Mitt-Romney-appointed-Planned-Par", "ruling_link_text": "Board has no say in abortion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n\tYouTube.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Hwh82GtVGh4\">Changed?</a>&quot;
