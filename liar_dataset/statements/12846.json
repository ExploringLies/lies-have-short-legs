Rick Scott has been for Florida, U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham said to delegates at the Democratic National Convention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a Florida delegation breakfast on July 28, Graham compared the Republican presidential nominee to former businessman Scott, saying they were both from the &quot;con-man wing&quot; of the GOP. She said Scott has stunted Florida&rsquo;s economy by keeping it a low-wage state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;After six years, we&rsquo;re now the third most populous state, but we rank 38th in wages,&quot; said Graham, the daughter of former Florida Gov. Bob Graham. &quot;Scott&#39;s actually proud of how low they are. He goes out around the country and advertises that to other states.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if Floridians really earned so little, and whether Scott was so proud of low wages that he was using it as a selling point for other states. We found Graham was tripped up by details for both parts of this claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Low for a reason</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with that number 38. Graham&rsquo;s office told us was from Census data from the 2011 American Community Survey ranking median household income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing to know about that is the figure is out of date. The <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/ranking-tables/\">latest data from the 2014 survey</a> show Florida has actually regressed to 40th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second thing to know is that median household income, economists told us, isn&rsquo;t the same as wages. Wages are a stand-in term for what we&rsquo;d consider a rate of payment for a unit of time, usually measured in hours. &nbsp;Income can include things like social security, capital gains, rent, dividends and interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics records wage estimates based on several different occupations. The <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_fl.htm\">state&rsquo;s median and mean hourly wages</a> for all occupations clocks in at $15.29 and $20.60, respectively, trailing the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm\">national median and mean</a> of $17.40 and $23.23.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moody&rsquo;s senior economist Chris Lafakis used the agency&rsquo;s Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, and said Florida ranks 30th by that measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A big reason for that is because Florida&rsquo;s tourism-based economy is filled with low-skilled jobs that just don&rsquo;t pay all that well. Meanwhile, the cost of living here is <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/rpp/rpp_newsrelease.htm\">marginally lower than the national average</a>, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Taxes, not wages</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott&rsquo;s refrain for the past six years has been about <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/promises/scott-o-meter/promise/588/create-over-700000-jobs/\">creating jobs</a> as the state recovered from recession. One of Scott&rsquo;s methods has been to try to steal jobs from other states (and <a href=\"http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/business/why-are-voters-angry-despite-more-jobs-those-jobs-/nq9Wt/\">not necessarily very high-paying ones</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we reviewed Scott&rsquo;s statements from these recruiting missions &mdash; to places like <a href=\"http://www.flgov.com/governor-rick-scott-to-kentucky-business-leaders-book-a-one-way-ticket-to-florida-2/\">Kentucky</a>, <a href=\"http://www.flgov.com/governor-rick-scott-to-pennsylvania-job-creators-ill-see-you-in-february-3/\">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flgov.com/governor-rick-scott-to-illinois-business-leaders-get-a-one-way-ticket-to-florida-2/\">Illinois</a> &mdash; we found he did focus quite a bit on the state&rsquo;s low taxes for businesses. The lack of state income tax also was a major highlight of sales pitches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Graham spokesman said she was specifically referring to a <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/blog/morning-edition/2016/04/enterprise-florida-ad-targets-california-minimum.html\">radio ad that ran in California</a> during Scott&rsquo;s trip there in May 2016. The commercial attacked California&rsquo;s recent move to raise the minimum wage to $15, while touting Florida&rsquo;s growing economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Seven hundred thousand. That&rsquo;s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage,&quot; said the ad from Enterprise Florida, the state&rsquo;s public-private economic development arm chaired by Scott. &quot;Ready to leave California? Go to Florida instead &mdash; no state income tax, and Gov. Scott has cut regulations. Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida previously researched whether California stood to lose 700,000 jobs because of the wage increase and rated the statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/may/04/enterprise-florida/florida-agencys-misleading-attack-californias-mini/\">Mostly False</a>. We learned the figure was a projection of how many jobs California could have added by 2026 if it didn&rsquo;t increase the minimum wage, not a decline in net employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz said the ad wasn&rsquo;t Scott bragging about low wages, but rather him pointing out differences between the states&rsquo; economies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He has never said he is proud of how low our wages are,&quot; Schutz said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible to argue Scott&rsquo;s comparison is inferring Florida is benefitting precisely because it&rsquo;s not raising wages like California. He has certainly <a href=\"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-rick-scott-jobs-beth-kassab-20160505-column.html\">been accused</a> of <a href=\"http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/opinion/editorial-floridas-low-wages-are-nothing-to-brag-a/nrHrf/\">talking up</a> Florida&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2016/02/24/low-wages-cost-florida-taxpayers-114-billion-yearly-seiu-study-says\">low wages</a>, even though he doesn&rsquo;t explicitly say it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;By raising the minimum wage in California, 700,000 people are going to lose their jobs, there are a lot of opportunities for companies to prosper in Florida and compete here and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going after,&quot; Scott <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-florida-gov-jobs-minimum-wage-20160429-story.html\">told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em></a> in May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that strikes us more as saying California is going too high, not necessarily talking up that Florida is staying too low. Keep in mind that Florida&rsquo;s minimum wage of $8.05 per hour is already higher than the federally mandated $7.25 an hour, and is<a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0400-0499/0448/Sections/0448.110.html\"> pegged to inflation by law</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts told us companies weigh many factors when deciding whether to relocate. Businesses usually are more concerned with how well a labor pool will perform for the compensation they receive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That doesn&rsquo;t mean &lsquo;cheap&rsquo; workers, but workers that represent a good value (how productive workers are relative to the cost of hiring workers),&quot; Rollins College economics professor&nbsp;Bill Seyfried said in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida also is not the only state faced with lackluster wage growth. Tina Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University, said trying to increase purchasing power is a global problem. She cited an <a href=\"http://offers.indeed.com/rs/699-SXJ-715/images/State%20of%20Opportunity%20-%20Indeed%20Hiring%20Lab.pdf\">Indeed Hiring Lab report</a> that said real wage growth is lagging overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Only 16 percent of jobs today are both high-paying and saw wage growth at least matching inflation over the past 10 years,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graham said, &quot;We rank 38th in wages. ... (Rick Scott) goes out around the country and advertises that to other states.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are issues with the figure she used, which is both outdated and an improper reading of how wages are calculated. But while there&rsquo;s no question Florida&rsquo;s wages are low by national standards, it doesn&rsquo;t appear Scott has boasted (at least publicly) about this fact while recruiting businesses from other states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The closest example is Enterprise Florida&rsquo;s California radio ad, which focused on the Golden State&rsquo;s lower jobs forecast after boosting the minimum wage. While clearly opposing the $15 minimum wage, the ad focused on lower taxes and less regulation, not Florida&rsquo;s minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Graham&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e3466756-1fd9-4fa7-8d70-4ed10bc7f1c8\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e3466756-1fd9-4fa7-8d70-4ed10bc7f1c8</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-03T12:02:14.635873", "ruling_date": "2016-08-03T16:10:02", "ruling_headline": "Gwen Graham says Rick Scott boasts about Florida's low wages", "ruling_headline_slug": "gwen-graham-says-rick-scott-boasts-about-floridas-", "ruling_link_text": "Wages are low, but Scott had focused on taxes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>U.S. Rep.
