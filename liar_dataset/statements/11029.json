With the referendum results all in, the possibility that Greece might ditch the Euro, the European Union&rsquo;s common currency, became more likely than ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before the vote though, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman warned that the greatest worry might have less to do with Greece than with other shaky economies in the Euro zone. On ABC&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/paul-krugman-stake-greece-debt-crisis-32234481\">This Week</a></em>, Krugman downplayed the impact of the Greek economy per se.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Greece is not a big economy,&quot; Krugman told host George Stephanopoulos, &quot;It&#39;s about the size of metropolitan Miami. So if you asked how much direct spillover there is from whatever happens in Greece, not that much.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But if Greece bailed on the Euro, Krugman said, Spain and Portugal might follow, which would gut the idea of a unified pan-European economy to compete with the powerhouses of America and China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our focus is decidedly more humble than the future of Europe. We wanted to check Krugman&rsquo;s comparison of Greece to the greater Miami area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Krugman has not rested on his Nobel Prize laurels. He is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The latest estimate of the Gross Domestic Product of the Miami-Ft. Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area, according to Washington&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_metro/gdp_metro_newsrelease.htm\">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>, was $281 billion in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The same year, the<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html\"> CIA estimated</a> the size of the Greek economy at $282.6 billion in 2013. Another estimate, from the <a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm\">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a>, put Greece&rsquo;s GDP at about $283 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Either number supports Krugman&rsquo;s point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The only caveats are technical. The CIA and OECD estimates are based on &quot;purchasing power parity,&quot; a set of formulas that adjust for how much it costs to buy exactly the same basket of goods in two countries using different currencies. The OECD says that <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/std/purchasingpowerparities-frequentlyaskedquestionsfaqs.htm\">filtering out price differences</a> gives a more accurate comparison of the economies of the two countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you measure the Greek economy strictly by the market exchange rate, the numbers shift. According to the <a href=\"http://databank.worldbank.org/data//reports.aspx?source=2&amp;country=GRC&amp;series=&amp;period=\">World Bank</a> the country&rsquo;s GDP was $242.2 billion in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Compared to the total Euro zone economy, Greece represented about 2.2 percent of the zone&rsquo;s $12 trillion-plus GDP in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By the way, if the size of the Greek economy is about the same as that of the greater Miami metro region, that&rsquo;s the extent of the similarity. The average person in Miami was much better off financially with a per capita GDP of $48,225. In Greece, it was $25,666.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Krugman said that the economy of Greece is about a big as that of the Miami metropolitan area. Based on a common measure of Gross Domestic Product, that is accurate. The GDP of Greece was about $282 billion in 2013, and the Miami metro area had a GDP of $281 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We rate the claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-07-06T15:21:37.976734", "ruling_date": "2015-07-06T15:39:49", "ruling_headline": "Yep, Greece and Miami metro have about the same GDP", "ruling_headline_slug": "yep-greece-and-miami-metro-have-about-same-gdp", "ruling_link_text": "Tourists like both places, too", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC News, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/video/paul-krugman-stake-greece-debt-crisis-32234481\"><em>This Week with George Stephanopoulos</em></a>, July 5, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, <a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">GDP data</a>, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Economic Analysis, <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_metro/gdp_metro_newsrelease.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Advance 2013, and Revised 2001&ndash;2012 GDP-by-Metropolitan-Area Statistics</a>.
