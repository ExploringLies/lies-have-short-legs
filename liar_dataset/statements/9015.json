It&rsquo;s such a popular policy, he said in a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/05/remarks-president-dnc-dinner\"><u>speech</u></a> on March 5, 2014, that even Republicans have little quarrel with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When I talk about (raising the) minimum wage,&quot; Obama said, &quot;not only is it good policy, but the majority of the country, including half of Republicans, agree with it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether polling data backed up this claim. So we looked at independent polls taken recently that asked about the minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A review of the polling data suggests a more nuanced situation than Obama&rsquo;s claim suggests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our first look at the data showed that a minimum-wage hike is popular among Americans broadly. For instance, when the <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/work.htm\"><u>CBS News-</u><em><u>New York Times</u></em><u> poll</u></a> asked, &quot;Do you favor or oppose raising the minimum wage to $10.10?&quot; in February 2014, the poll found 65 percent support. And that was actually down a bit from the 72 percent support registered in the January edition of the poll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, a <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2014/01/23/most-see-inequality-growing-but-partisans-differ-over-solutions/\"><u>Pew Research Center/</u><em><u>USA Today</u></em></a> poll from January asked whether respondents supported an &quot;increase in the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour&quot; and found 73 percent support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about Republicans specifically? More than half of Republicans favor a minimum-wage increase, polls found, but in most of these polls, less than half of Republicans supported raising the wage to $10.10, the amount Obama is seeking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One poll that did not specify a target amount for the minimum-wage hike was conducted by <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=1993\"><u>Quinnipiac University</u></a>. It asked, &quot;Would you support or oppose raising the national minimum wage, which is now $7.25 an hour?&quot; Among Republicans, 52 percent expressed support, while 45 percent said they opposed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That provides some support to Obama&rsquo;s claim. But once respondents were asked by other pollsters about the $10.10 figure -- a roughly 40 percent increase from today&rsquo;s federal minimum wage -- Republican support sagged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clearest example is a <a href=\"http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1030274/new-york-times-cbs-news-feb-poll-results.pdf\"><u>CBS-</u><em><u>New York Times</u></em><u> poll</u></a> from February that asked, &quot;As you may know, the federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour. Do you favor or oppose raising the minimum wage to $10.10?&quot; Republicans expressed 42 percent support, 54 percent opposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another clear example was an <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/18/National-Politics/Polling/question_12600.xml?uuid=e1hh-mehEeOZe5ITsX2slw#\"><u>ABC News-</u><em><u>Washington Post</u></em><u> poll</u></a> from December, 2013 that asked, &quot;The minimum wage in this country is now $7.25 an hour. What do you think it should be?&quot; Among Republicans, only 21 percent favored keeping it the same or lowering it, but even fewer respondents -- 7 percent -- favored a minimum wage in excess of $10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two other polls showed Republican support close to 50 percent, but falling just short. However, the differences were within the margin of sampling error -- it&#39;s possible that more than half of Republicans were in support of a $10.10 wage, though also possible that the actual support level was even lower than the official result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/201808657?access_key=key-6momr3if57xtmuhr3wm&amp;allow_share=true&amp;escape=false&amp;view_mode=scroll\">CBS-<em>New York Times</em> poll</a> from January that asked the same question as the February poll found that Republicans expressed 48 percent support, 51 percent opposition to a $10.10 wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And an <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303330204579250473005492880\"><u>NBC News-</u><em><u>Wall Street Journal</u></em><u> poll</u></a> <a href=\"http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i//MSNBC/Sections/A_Politics/_Today_Stories_Teases/13528%20December%20NBC-WSJ%20Final%20Filled-InCORRECTED.pdf\"><u>from December 2013</u></a> asked, &quot;I&#39;m going to mention a number of different amounts and for each one, please tell me if you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose raising the hourly minimum wage to that amount.&quot; When presented with the $10.10 rate, 47 percent of Republicans expressed support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One poll clearly supported Obama&rsquo;s position. The January <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2014/01/23/most-see-inequality-growing-but-partisans-differ-over-solutions/\"><u>Pew Research Center/</u><em><u>USA Today</u></em></a> poll found 53 percent of Republicans backing a $10.10 minimum wage, with 43 percent opposed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The significance of the $10.10 figure is not academic. According to a March 6 <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/03/06/the-inside-story-of-how-the-white-house-learned-to-love-the-minimum-wage/\"><u>account</u></a> in the <em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;early last year, White House strategists rejected (the $10.10 figure), worried that it could destroy jobs and anger the business community just as the regulation-heavy Affordable Care Act was about to take effect. Instead, former officials say, the White House settled on a more cautious path,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/13/fact-sheet-president-s-plan-reward-work-raising-minimum-wage\"><u>unveiling a $9-an-hour minimum wage</u></a> proposal &mdash; a target even lower than Obama&nbsp;<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/05/markets/thebuzz/index.htm?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fmoney_news_economy+%28Economy+News%29\"><u>had proposed</u></a> during the 2008 campaign.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the <em>Post</em> reported, the lower amount &quot;disappointed advocates for the working poor, as well as congressional Democrats, who were already pushing to set the $7.25 wage closer to $10 an hour. Over the past year, Obama reconsidered, casting off initial concerns in favor of unifying his party ahead of this fall&rsquo;s midterm elections.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, White House officials had long realized there was a difference in the degree of public support for a $10.10 minimum wage and a smaller hike, so it would be misleading for Obama to now imply that majority Republican support for an unspecified minimum-wage hike means that Republicans automatically support the president&rsquo;s proposal to raise the wage to $10.10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama said,&nbsp;&quot;When I talk about (raising the) minimum wage ... half of Republicans&nbsp;agree with it.&quot;&nbsp;Republicans do support a minimum-wage hike if you don&#39;t specify a dollar figure. But once you mention the $10.10 target Obama wants, his case gets shakier.
