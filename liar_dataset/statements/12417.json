In an attack ad, the group highlighted Sanders&rsquo; and Clinton&rsquo;s <em>Saturday Night Live</em> portrayals and less-than-serious moments on the campaign trail (i.e. dancing). It ended with O&rsquo;Malley saying <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_martinomalley_donaldtrump_hillaryclinton_om7iz/\">a presidency shouldn&rsquo;t be about entertainment</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another ad <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_berniesanders_m674h/\">attacked</a> Sanders for his record on guns: &quot;Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill &mdash; background checks and waiting periods. ...

But that is not enough to win the nomination. Why spend money that will have little return on the investment?&quot; said John G. Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University who wrote&nbsp;<em>In Defense of Negativity: Attack Advertising in Presidential Campaign</em><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-claims-meet-press-wall-street-atta/\"> and spoke with us</a> in April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one case, a&nbsp;&quot;faux <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_berniesanders_ud3s8/\">attack</a>&quot; from a conservative super PAC appears to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/esa-fund-anti-sanders-super-pac_us_56ae76cae4b0010e80ea89fa\">actually bolster Sanders</a>, illustrating another line of argument: Republicans may prefer to run against the more radical Sanders in a general election. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though Sanders hasn&rsquo;t been hit nearly as hard as Clinton, he has been attacked by the right a few times. Future 45, a conservative Super PAC <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/bernie-sanders-gop-super-pac-attack-219436\">funded by backers of Marco Rubio</a>, ran a <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_berniesanders_ckd5l/\">30-second spot </a>sounding the alarms on higher taxes to come under Sanders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders is also featured in Republican-on-Republican attack ads as an unfavorable comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, the anti-Trump Club for Growth has <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/browse/?q=candidate%3A%22bernie+sanders%22+NOT+sponsor%3A%22Bernie+2016%22&amp;order=count\">highlighted</a> <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_donaldtrump_hillaryclinton_berniesanders_0ltez/\">similarities</a> between Trump&rsquo;s positions and Sanders&rsquo; (as well as Clinton&rsquo;s and Obama&rsquo;s). Similarly, American Future Fund, a conservative 501(c)(4) or &quot;dark money&quot; group, ran an <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_tedcruz_berniesanders_jih4s/\">attack ad</a> against Ted Cruz by lumping him in with Sanders and other Democrats on national security issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mike Huckabee&rsquo;s campaign, meanwhile, warned voters about &quot;a crazy old man named Bernie&quot; in a rhyming Christmas-themed <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_mikehuckabee_i1z44/\">ad</a> and crooned&nbsp;&quot;<a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_martinomalley_berniesanders_jebbush_50n82/\">Hello from the caucus night.
