And Fisker is still building their cars in Finland.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s a few things to check here.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tDid stimulus money go to Finland?</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tWhat is the financial deal between the United States and Fisker and did it produce jobs in the U.S.?</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tWas that deal a payback to special friends of the Obama administration?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact tackled many of these <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/03/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-jobs-finland/\">questions in some detail</a> last April. Back then, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=lUQdP6y0ArM\">an ad </a>from the conservative group, Americans for Prosperity asserted &quot;The Obama administration admitted the truth, that $2.3 billion of tax credits went overseas ... Half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>What Fisker got</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2009, an American car company, Fisker Automotive,<a href=\"https://lpo.energy.gov/?p=888\"> won a total of $528 million in loan</a> guarantees to build two high-end electric hybrids, the Karma and the Atlantic (originally named Nina). The ultimate goal was to build the Atlantic at a defunct auto plant in Delaware. Work on the Atlantic is currently on hold, and the Delaware plant has yet to open.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe engineering and design for the Karma was done in the United States, but according to the U.S. Energy Department, the plan <a href=\"https://lpo.energy.gov/?p=888\">from the beginning </a>was to build the cars in Finland. Fisker Automotive told <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/car-company-us-loan-builds-cars-finland/story?id=14770875#.UAcDoLTJGjt\">ABC News</a> this work employed about 500 Finnish workers. Company spokesman Roger Ornisher told PolitiFact that the plant has produced over 1,500 Karmas so far.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Not stimulus dollars</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim about American stimulus dollars paying for jobs in Finland is flawed in several important respects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, the money did not come from the stimulus. This nuance seems to slip through the cracks again and again, so the correct information bears repeating.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat money came as a loan -- not a grant or a tax credit -- through the Energy Department&rsquo;s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program. That program predates the Obama administration. It was not part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, also known as the stimulus. In fact, it&rsquo;s a program signed into existence by President George W. Bush <a href=\"https://lpo.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/finalrule1.pdf\">in 2007</a> and first funded by legislation Bush signed in 2008.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/bitstreams/19813.pdf\">only reference to this loan program in the stimulus</a> is that it received $10 million for administrative expenses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Bush administration was in charge when Fisker Automotive filed its application. The Obama administration was in charge when the company&rsquo;s loan was approved. The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Not half a billion dollars</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven as a loan, Fisker Automotive has not received anywhere close to half a billion dollars.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo far, Fisker has drawn down about $193 million, and the Energy Department won&rsquo;t release any more until the company completes more work. The government <a href=\"https://lpo.energy.gov/?p=888\">loan package came in two parts</a>. An initial $170 million was for design and engineering to complete the Karma using at least 65 percent American-made parts. A second $360 million loan would be to open an American plant to build the Atlantic. Just about all of that second part is still in government hands.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor those who would say that money is fungible and there&rsquo;s no guarantee that some of the federal dollars were not used to pay Finnish workers, the company has an answer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt says it raised much more money from private investors; Ornisher told us the total is now over $1 billion. While Ornisher won&rsquo;t say how much Fisker spent in Finland, he says it was &quot;easily within&quot; the amount of that private money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFisker Automotive also says that the accounting firm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers audits its accounts to ensure that all federal dollars are spent in the U.S.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The jobs</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOrnisher says the Karma and Atlantic projects support some 500 Fisker employees in the United States. He says it&rsquo;s much harder to estimate the number of jobs associated with the supply of parts -- 65 percent of which are supposed to come from American companies. Ornishers also says the company has sold about 1,000 cars in the U.S. and that provides work at some 45 retailers across the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Political connections</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad hints darkly that a lot of this is tied to political friends of the president. During a campaign briefing, senior campaign adviser Ed Gillespie singled out the Fisker Automotive deal and one of its investors, John Doerr.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You know you have John Doerr, who raised a lot of money for President Obama (and) got appointed to an economic recovery advisory board.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;And then, his firm had a big investment in Fisker Automotive, which got over half a billion dollars in loan guarantees from the Department of Energy, which did not result in jobs being created in America, but actually jobs being created overseas in Finland. But Kleiner Perkins (Doerr&rsquo;s firm) did quite well.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, Doerr is a big Democratic donor -- over $175,000 since 2008. And Ornisher described Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers as &quot;one of the major investors&quot; in Fisker.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut as the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/4-pinocchios-for-mitt-romneys-unproven-claim-of-crony-capitalism/2012/07/17/gJQAYuYPsW_blog.html\"><em>Washington Post </em>noted</a>, Kleiner has many partners, and some of them are hefty donors on the Republican side. One, Ray Lane, backed John McCain in 2008.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Romney campaign ad said that stimulus dollars paid for jobs in Finland. There is nothing accurate in this claim. The federal loan guarantees the company received were not part of the stimulus, and there is no evidence that any government dollars paid for work done by Finnish workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOrnisher, the company spokesman, told us the contract to produce the cars in Finland had been signed before the federal loan was approved. Also, measures were put in place to ensure that taxpayer dollars only went for work done in America.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFisker Automotive has yet to open the factory in Delaware but it also hasn&rsquo;t received the large government loan needed to do that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad&rsquo;s suggestion that the Fisker loan was a reward to a political supporter also falls flat. The program was approved initially by the Bush administration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rule the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-20T11:52:39.902473", "ruling_date": "2012-07-20T13:47:11", "ruling_headline": "Romney ad says stimulus money went to buy electric cars from Finland as a payback to Obama supporters", "ruling_headline_slug": "romney-ad-says-stimulus-money-went-buy-electric-ca", "ruling_link_text": "Not the stimulus, not to buy foreign cars", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRomney for President, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/rXdF-cR66V8\">Where Did All the Money Go?</a>, July 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/03/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-jobs-finland/\">Ad says stimulus tax credits funded jobs in Finland</a>, May 3, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Research Service,<a href=\"http://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/bitstreams/19813.pdf\"> Energy Provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a>, March 12, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Department of Energy,<a href=\"http://www.afdc.energy.gov/laws/arra\"> Alternative Fuels Data Center: ARRA</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDepartment of Energy,<a href=\"https://lpo.energy.gov/?p=888\"> US Energy Secretary Chu Announces $528 Million Loan for Advanced Vehicle Technology for Fisker Automotive</a>, September 22, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Fisker Automotive spokesman Roger Ormisher, July 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Washington Post</em>,<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/4-pinocchios-for-mitt-romneys-unproven-claim-of-crony-capitalism/2012/07/17/gJQAYuYPsW_blog.html\"> 4 Pinochois for an unproven Romney claim of crony capitalism</a>, July 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tABC News, &quot;<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/car-company-us-loan-builds-cars-finland/story?id=14770875#.T57vacRYv2c\">Car Company Gets U.S. Loan, Builds Cars In Finland</a>,&quot; Oct. 20, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFisker Automotive, &quot;<a href=\"http://media.fiskerautomotive.com/global/en-us/Media/PressRelease.aspx?mediaid=567&amp;title=fisker-statement-re-misleading-news-reports\">Press Releases: Fisker Statement re: Misleading News Reports</a>,&quot; Oct. 21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFederal Register, &quot;<a href=\"https://lpo.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/finalrule1.pdf\">Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program</a>,&quot; Nov. 12, 2008<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Center for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org\">Opensecrets.org</a>, accessed July 18, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 34, "current_job": "Former governor", "false_count": 32, "first_name": "Mitt", "half_true_count": 58, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 5, "last_name": "Romney", "mostly_true_count": 33, "name_slug": "mitt-romney", "pants_count": 19, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-mittromney.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/5/", "total_count": 221, "true_count": 30, "website": "http://www.mittromney.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays stimulus money went to buy electric cars from Finland as a payback to Obama supporters.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign commercial", "statement_date": "2012-07-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 219, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/219/", "subject": "Message Machine 2012", "subject_slug": "message-machine-2012", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/", "/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 150, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/150/", "subject": "Stimulus", "subject_slug": "stimulus", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
