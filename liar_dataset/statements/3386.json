Rick Scott welcomed business leaders to his State of the State address, saying they exemplified his efforts to win jobs for the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne of those leaders was Dean Minardi, chief financial officer of Bing Energy Inc., a company that uses nanotechnology to make hydrogen fuel cells.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Bing Energy, a California-based company, was courted by offers from several states, but Bing decided to come to Florida in December, and Tallahassee, which is nice,&quot; Scott said in his March 8, 2011, address to a joint session of the Legislature. &quot;The reason Florida won? Dean said it was our plan to eliminate the corporate tax.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to fact-check the claim that Bing came here because of Scott&rsquo;s plan to eliminate the corporate tax, which now stands at 5.5 percent of business income. Scott intends to reduce the tax to 3 percent on the way to eliminating it entirely.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe soon found video of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrZj2Hc1qB8&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Minardi speaking at a press conference</a> on Feb. 10, announcing that the company was moving its corporate headquarters to Tallahassee and opening its first production facility there. The move could bring up to 244 jobs to Florida.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The tipping point in our decision to move to Florida is the governor&rsquo;s pledge to try to eliminate the corporate income tax. It&rsquo;s huge,&quot; Minardi said. &quot;From a business point of view, the simple truth is that the more income a company can keep, the more people it can hire. And the more people we can hire, the faster we can grow. Simple truth.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll done? Not quite.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs you may have noticed, the corporate tax rate has not yet been lowered, and it&rsquo;s hardly a done deal that it will be. Legislators have said their first priority is a balanced budget without tax increases. Tax cuts for businesses might have to wait.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd there are a few other pertinent facts about Bing Energy&rsquo;s business.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Bing Energy intends to make fuel cells using &quot;buckypaper,&quot; a fiber that&rsquo;s stronger than steel but has a fraction of its weight. Some of the leading research on buckypaper is being done at Florida State University in Tallahassee, at the school&rsquo;s Center for Advanced Power Systems.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; In September 2010, <a href=\"http://www.fsu.edu/news/2010/09/15/fuel.cells/\">FSU announced</a> it was entering into a commercialization agreement with Bing Energy. Dr. Jim P. Zheng, a professor with FSU since 1997, would develop several prototypes of fuel cells, while Bing Energy would evaluate the cells for effectiveness and their potential for mass production, the university said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; In October 2010, Bing Energy asked Leon County officials for tax incentives to continue its work on fuel cells under its agreement with FSU.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; At the February 2011 press conference announcing Bing Energy&rsquo;s move to Tallahassee, FSU president Eric J. Barron credited the &quot;breakthrough research&quot; of FSU&rsquo;s faculty and added that the company&rsquo;s decision was &quot;confirming that the investment made in their work by our state and by the federal government has realized its commercial potential.&quot; Scott himself added, &quot;If you look at other capitals with great universities, they ought to be big business centers. And this city, Tallahassee, should be a significant business center.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott&#39;s right that Bing Energy&rsquo;s CFO said Scott&rsquo;s proposal to eliminate corporate income taxes was the &quot;tipping point&quot; for the company&rsquo;s decision to move to Tallahassee. And we have little doubt that Minardi loves the idea of getting rid of the tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the company already had signed a high-tech commercialization agreement with FSU and sought tax breaks from local officials -- all before Scott was even elected.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo the potential of getting rid of the corporate tax outweighs the reality of a university&rsquo;s research and commercialization agreement? We don&rsquo;t think any hard-headed business person would buy that. That&#39;s&nbsp;the way&nbsp;Minardi described it, and Scott quotes him accurately. But we think both men are overlooking&nbsp;important details that would put this deal in a different light. We rate Scott&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-03-08T19:59:14.576574", "ruling_date": "2011-03-08T20:31:49", "ruling_headline": "Rick Scott said the corporate income tax fueled Bing Energy's move to Florida", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-scott-said-corporate-income-tax-fueled-Bing", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, but there's also a high-tech contract with FSU", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBing Energy, <a href=\"http://bingenergyinc.com/\">Bing Energy website</a>, accessed March 8, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBing Energy, <a href=\"http://bingenergyinc.com/?p=119\">Florida Governor Rick Scott welcomes Bing Energy to Florida</a>, Feb. 10, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYouTube, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrZj2Hc1qB8&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Bing Energy press conference</a>, Feb. 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>St. Petersburg Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/gubernatorial/bing-energy-to-move-headquarters-to-florida-lured-by-prospect-of-tax-cuts/1150840\">Bing Energy to move headquarters to Florida, lured by prospect of tax cuts</a>, Feb. 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>The Tallahassee Democrat,</em> <a href=\"http://www.tallahassee.com/article/20110211/BUSINESS/102110323/Bing-Energy-brings-jobs-to-Tallahassee\">Bing Energy brings jobs to Tallahassee</a>, Feb. 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida State University, <a href=\"http://www.fsu.edu/news/2010/09/15/fuel.cells/\">Agreement inked on innovative carbon nanotube technology; could lead to cheaper, more efficient fuel cells</a>, Sept. 15, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFlorida Department of Revenue, <a href=\"http://dor.myflorida.com/dor/taxes/corporate.html\">Florida&#39;s Corporate Income Tax</a>, March 8, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>St. Petersburg Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/26/State/A_special_report_on_F.shtml\">A special report on Florida&#39;s corporate income tax</a>, Oct. 26, 2003</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 32, "current_job": "Governor", "false_count": 26, "first_name": "Rick", "half_true_count": 40, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 383, "last_name": "Scott", "mostly_true_count": 36, "name_slug": "rick-scott", "pants_count": 8, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/rlscott.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/383/", "total_count": 166, "true_count": 15, "website": "http://www.flgov.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tBing Energy said it decided to move to Florida because of Gov.
