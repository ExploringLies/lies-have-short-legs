McAuliffe&rsquo;s campaign is &quot;being very negative and they haven&rsquo;t rolled out any policies,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNo policies? Nada? Nary a one?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tTo check Cuccinelli&rsquo;s claim, we turned to Merriam-Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary, which defines <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/policy\">policy</a> as &quot;a high-level overall plan embracing the general goals and acceptable procedures especially of a governmental body.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSo there are two components to policy: a goal and a process to get there. And we&rsquo;ll add one more ground rule: the proposals should be in writing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tScouring McAuliffe&rsquo;s website, we came across several proposals that clearly met all of these tests and were released prior to Cucinelli&rsquo;s June attacks. They are:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t*An executive order <a href=\"http://terrymcauliffe.com/mcauliffe-proposes-gift-ban-for-virginia-elected-officials-will-enforce-it-for-himself-even-if-legislature-does-not-act/\">banning gifts</a> over $100 to the governor&rsquo;s family and barring all gifts to the governor&rsquo;s household from lobbyists and others who do business with the state. McAuliffe said he would also ask the General Assembly pass the same rules for itself, the lieutenant governor and attorney general, in addition to requiring that gifts of more than $500 to dependent family members be publicly reported.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t*Creating a <a href=\"http://terrymcauliffe.com/mcauliffe-proposes-formation-of-independent-ethics-commission-to-hold-elected-officials-accountable/\">bipartisan commission</a> to investigate ethics complaints against state politicians or discrepancies in their disclosure reports and refer violations to the proper disciplinary body. McAuliffe says the panel would have a &quot;small professional staff&quot; and would be funded through lobbyist registration fees.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t*Giving localities the <a href=\"http://terrymcauliffe.com/mcauliffe-proposes-local-tax-reform-plan-reduce-burdensome-taxes-for-virginias-businesses/\">option</a> of reducing or eliminating the business and professional licensing tax, the machinery and tool tax and the merchants capital tax. McAuliffe would appoint a commission to help localities come up with revenue-neutral ways to end or cut the levies. Cuccinelli, we should note, also has <a href=\"http://www.cuccinelli.com/ken-has-a-plan-for-jobs/\">proposed</a> abolishing each of the three taxes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t*Appointing a commission to recommend <a href=\"http://terrymcauliffe.com/on-the-issues/policy/\">reforms</a> to Standards of Learning tests given to public school students. McAuliffe says the multiple-choice tests are a flawed measure of teaching and learning and the state should also use essay and short-answer questions.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSo how does Cuccinelli come up with zero?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRichard Cullen, communications director for the campaign, sent us an email saying Cuccinelli&rsquo;s comments do not suggest that McAuliffe has put no proposals on the table.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;Ken uses qualifiers that I think are important: &lsquo;substantive,&rsquo; &lsquo;nothing in detail,&rsquo; zero policy rollouts,&rsquo;&quot; he wrote.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s true that when Cuccinelli criticized McAuliffe in late May, he did use the words &nbsp;&quot;zero policy rollouts,&quot; and added the caveat that his opponent had offered &quot;nothing in detail&quot; or &quot;substantive.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut those last two qualifiers disappeared as Cuccinelli amped up his attack in June, so they are not a &nbsp;factor in this Truth-O-Meter.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe term &quot;rollout&quot; remained in Cuccinelli&rsquo;s comments and deserves consideration. &quot;Ken has outlined comprehensive policy proposals in front of reporters across the Commonwealth and allowed the public to digest and scrutinize his ideas,&quot; Cullen said. &quot;At no point has Terry McAuliffe done that.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMerriam-Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary defines <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rollout\">rollout</a> as &quot;the widespread public introduction of a new product.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMcAuliffe has not introduced policy with the verve of Cuccinelli, who called a news conference with the capitol press corps in May to announce his tax cutting plan and answer questions about it. But McAuliffe has publicized his major initiatives in press releases, interviews and speeches around the state.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tJosh Schwerin, a spokesman for McAuliffe, said the Democrat has put out &quot;lots of policies&quot; and referred us to a 13-page document on the campaign&rsquo;s website entitled &quot;<a href=\"http://terrymcauliffe.com/on-the-issues/policy/\">Putting Jobs First</a>.&quot; &nbsp;In general, we found the document to be more of a platform laying out McAuliffe&rsquo;s broad goals than a policy paper detailing how he would accomplish them. For example, McAuliffe repeatedly calls for greater investment in mass transit and public and higher education, but does not put price tags on his proposals or say how the state would pay for them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCuccinelli, in contrast, has not issued a platform as broad as McAuliffe&rsquo;s, but has unveiled some of his policies in greater depth that his opponent. Even so, Cuccinelli has left many major questions unanswered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tFor example, Cuccinelli has called for cutting the 6 percent corporate income tax rate to 4 percent over four years and reducing the 5.75 individual income tax rate to 5 percent over the same span. The cost of the cuts would be $1.4 billion a year, which Cuccinelli says he would pay for by eliminating tax exemptions and loopholes -- but he won&rsquo;t say which ones. That work would be assigned to a commission after he was elected.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAt least twice, Cuccinelli has said McAuliffe hasn&rsquo;t &quot;rolled out any policies.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMcAuliffe has rolled out a number of detailed steps for ethics reforms in state government. His proposals to improve standardized testing in public schools and give localities options to end some taxes, while relying on commissions to make the hard decisions, both set goals and a route for achieving them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe&rsquo;re not conferring wonk status on McAuliffe or anything close to it. But Cuccinelli&rsquo;s statement is an obvious stretch and we rate it False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-07-09T23:50:43.724413", "ruling_date": "2013-07-10T11:05:01", "ruling_headline": "Cuccinelli says McAuliffe has rolled out no policies ", "ruling_headline_slug": "cuccinelli-says-mcauliffe-has-rolled-out-no-polici", "ruling_link_text": "What about Terry McAuliffe?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-1b6a1389-c6b2-2972-91c8-01ee3e98d369\">\r\n\tPolitiFact Virginia, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/article/2013/jun/06/cuccinelli-and-mcauliffe-ask-each-other-wheres-mea/\">Cuccinelli</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/article/2013/jun/06/cuccinelli-and-mcauliffe-ask-each-other-wheres-mea/\"> and McAuliffe ask each other, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the beef?&rsquo;</a>&quot;
