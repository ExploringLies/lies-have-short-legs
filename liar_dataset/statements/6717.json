He said: &quot;I want to talk about the fact that the Paul Ryan plan helps save Medicare when the Democrat plan lets Medicare end. There&rsquo;s a lot of misnomers out there. He wants to charge that we&rsquo;re raising Social Security age to 70. Under the current structure, that happens sometime at the beginning of the next century.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an <a href=\"http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/dnj/access/2750166311.html?FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;fmac=33b202a4b823cb2b31888c24c038eda9&amp;date=Sep+2%2C+2012&amp;author=Sam+Stockard&amp;desc=For+District+4+incumbent+backs+JOBS%2C+REFORMS%2C+ROMNEY\">interview </a>&nbsp;with The Daily News Journal of Murfreesboro, DesJarlais said that &quot;as far as this charge that I voted to raise the retirement age to 70, there&rsquo;s a process where the retirement is pushed back by one month every two years, so by the time the retirement age hits 70, it&rsquo;ll be sometime around the turn of the century.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe can understand why a candidate treads carefully on <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/\">Social Security</a>. But there is no disputing this: On March 29, 2012, as the House was considering a series of Republican-sponsored budget reduction plans, DesJarlais voted for two separate GOP plans that would have major impacts on Social Security -- one which would have raised the eligibility age to 70 by 2048, or 52 years before the &quot;turn of the century.&quot; Neither of the bills became law: The one that raised the retirement age to 70 in 2048 failed to pass the House and the other won House approval but never passed in the Democrat-controlled Senate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first was a budget-reduction plan submitted by the <a href=\"http://rsc.jordan.house.gov/aboutrsc/\">Republican Study Committee, </a>which calls itself &quot;a group of House Republicans organized for the purpose of advancing a conservative social and economic agenda.&quot; All of Tennessee&rsquo;s Republican House members except Rep. John Duncan Jr. of Knoxville are RSC members and all of them except Duncan voted for the RSC plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe RSC&rsquo;s website <a href=\"http://rsc.jordan.house.gov/uploadedfiles/rsc_budget_cut_cap_and_balance--long_doc--final.pdf\">describes its budget plan in full,</a> including its proposal for &quot;slowly increasing (Social Security&rsquo;s) retirement age to 70 years&hellip;. For those born in 1978, the full-retirement age would remain at 70 years old.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy our calculator, 1978 plus 70 is 2048 &ndash; more than five decades before the turn of the next century.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/2012/04/republican-study-committee-fiscal-year-2013-budget-details\">Bipartisan Policy Center&rsquo;s analysis </a>says: &quot;Starting in 2023, the RSC budget proposes to increase the Social Security full retirement age by two months every year until it reaches age 70 in the year 2047.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe RSC plan&rsquo;s failure cleared the way later that day for House approval of a separate plan by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, now the GOP vice presidential candidate. The Ryan plan did not list specific changes for Social Security but required Social Security trustees to submit a stabilization plan to the President and for the President to submit a plan to Congress. DesJarlais also voted for that plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn defending the accuracy of his statements, DesJarlais and his staff in essence contend that the Democrats have been attacking him for voting for the Ryan bill &ndash; which on March 29 did not contain a detailed provision for raising Social Security&rsquo;s retirement age &ndash; and that that was what he was responding to with his &quot;turn of the century&quot; claim. His office pointed to an earlier, 2010 version of Ryan&rsquo;s plan called <a href=\"http://roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/roadmap2final2.pdf\">&quot;Road Map to America&rsquo;s Future&quot;</a> that did include a detailed provision saying the Social Security. That plan says that &quot;retirement age will gradually increase until it reaches 70 in the next century.&quot; An important note on that, however -- DesJarlais was not in Congress in 2010. He did not vote on that plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDesJarlais&rsquo; statement on the matter says: &quot;My statement regarding the time frame for raising social security is completely accurate when talking about <a href=\"https://bl2prd0410.outlook.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=Q4RGLjAbg0u_d7TeTVxyIcFSzcfRYM8IocOlnFqUA3iNO8kjaobZ49iwntz06NlNwNAOh8qvAxs.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2froadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov%2fuploadedfiles%2froadmap2final2.pdf\">Ryan&rsquo;s budgetary roadmap</a>, which has been the only budget that has been discussed and what I believed was being referred to.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA review of Stewart&rsquo;s website, including a <a href=\"http://www.votestewart.com/video/scott-desjarlais-accidental-congressman\">web video</a>, and media releases shows he has been talking about both the RSC plan and &nbsp;the Ryan budget plan. But a press release issued by Stewart&rsquo;s campaign that says DesJarlais&rsquo; &quot;turn of the century&quot; claim &quot;may be the falsity of the century&quot; specifically refers to his vote for the RSC plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur ruling<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo defend himself against charges that he voted to raise the Social Security age to 70, the freshman congressman points to his support for Congressman Paul Ryan&rsquo;s 2010 budgetary road map where the retirement age doesn&rsquo;t hit 70 until the next century.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut DesJarlais was not even in Congress in 2010, and the only vote he ever made on a plan that included a target date for raising the age to 70 came earlier this year.That plan called for raising Social Security age to 70 by 2047 or 2048 -- 52 years before the century turns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor that bit of misdirection, we give the congressman a ruling of Mostly False.</b></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-16T20:41:41.756378", "ruling_date": "2012-09-17T04:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tennessee congressman defends vote raising Social Security age to 70 by saying it won\u2019t happen until \u201cturn of the century\u201d", "ruling_headline_slug": "tennessee-congressman-defends-vote-raising-social-", "ruling_link_text": "Voted for plan to push age to 70 by 2047", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.04240250028669834\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; font-weight: normal; \">Email statement from Rep.
