It's shameful.&quot; On Feb. 4, 2009, he said top executives at firms receiving federal aid will have their compensation capped at $500,000 and that bonuses would have to come as stock that they can't receive until the government is reimbursed.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n The New York State Comptroller reported in late January that Wall Street firms in 2008 handed out $18.4 billion in cash bonuses to employees who live in New York City, the sixth-largest amount on record. Critics have said the employees don't deserve the rewards because the firms lost more than $35 billion in 2008 and the federal government is spending hundreds of billions of dollars bailing out many of them.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx and supporter of George W. Bush, John McCain and other Republicans, tried to cool down the heated discussion with a bit of perspective on ABC's\n <em>\n  This Week\n </em>\n on Feb. 1, 2009.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Host George Stephanopoulos noted that Smith &quot;actually took a pay cut in December. You announced a 20 percent pay cut because of the performance of FedEx over the last year, because of the tough economic times. And I wonder ... what do you think of the bonus structure now on Wall Street?&quot;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Smith replied that compensation on Wall Street is built on bonuses &quot;much more so than in the industrial sector. As I understand it, the average bonus in that $18 billion is about $100,000 a year. The bonuses on Wall Street are down about 44 percent.&quot;\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Smith was not far off when it came to the average cash bonus. It was $112,000 in 2008, according to New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli's Jan. 28, 2009, report.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n And indeed bonuses were down 44 percent in a sense: The total amount given out in bonuses, $18.4 billion, was a decline of 44 percent from the $32.9 billion handed out in 2007.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n But due to job losses on Wall Street, there were fewer employees to split the pie in 2008. So the average bonus was down a&nbsp;slightly more modest&nbsp;37 percent from the previous year's average.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n Also, it might have been worth pointing out that while bonuses were well below the 2007 level, that average of $112,000 was still the fifth-highest since the comptroller's office started keeping records in 1985. And the total haul of $18.4 billion was the sixth highest on record. Both were around the same as 2004, a vastly better year for the securities industry and its investors.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n And although it's true that bonuses generally make up a substantial portion of the compensation on Wall Street, $112,000 is still more than twice the average salary in the United States.\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n But Smith is free to use statistics selectively &mdash; and the statistics he chose were off by just $12,000 and a few percentage points. We find his statement Mostly True.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:27:51.434141", "ruling_date": "2009-02-05T20:55:29", "ruling_headline": "FedEx chair delivers perspective on bonuses", "ruling_headline_slug": "fedex-chair-delivers-perspective-bonuses", "ruling_link_text": "He's off just a little", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p align=\"left\">\n <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/CEOProfiles/story?id=6780147&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\">\n  This Week&nbsp;with George Stephanopoulos\n </a>\n ,&nbsp;Feb. 1, 2009\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n New York State Comptroller's Office,\n <a href=\"http://www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/jan09/012809.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\n  DiNapoli: Wall Street Bonuses Fell 44% in 2008\n </a>\n , Jan. 28, 2009\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n The NewHour,\n <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/jan-june09/exec_comp_01-30.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Backlash Continues Over Billions Paid in Wall Street Bonuses in 2008\n </a>\n , Jan. 30, 2009\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n MarketWatch, Obama to limit bailed-out bank CEO pay to $500,000, Feb. 4, 2009\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n New York Times,\n <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/29/business/29bonus.html?scp=1&amp;sq=what%20red%20ink&amp;st=cse\" target=\"_blank\">\n  What Red Ink?
