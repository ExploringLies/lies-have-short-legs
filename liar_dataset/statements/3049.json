The post by Heflin, a former Texas House member and past chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, closes: &quot;This is not to say that the process of developing a 2012-13 state budget will be a walk in the park. But claims that Texas is $27 billion in the red are flat-out false.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlat-out for real?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered because news organizations including the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> included the $27 billion figure in their analyses of Combs&rsquo; forecast.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <em>Statesman&rsquo;</em>s Jan. 11 news article states: &quot;The comptroller&#39;s estimate sets the limit for spending and would put the budget shortfall at $27 billion if the state were to maintain the same level of service in public education, health and human services, prisons and more.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSimilarly, the <em>San Antonio Express-News</em> quotes Scott McCown, executive director of the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, saying the shortfall is at least $26.8 billion--the difference between Combs&rsquo; predicted state income and at least $99 billion in state revenue needed to maintain the current level of services, given the state&#39;s growing population and rising costs, including that of health care.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe newspaper quotes Rep. Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, saying that a shortfall of at least $27 billion is &quot;in the ballpark&quot; when looking at the money needed to provide the current level of services.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his update, Heflin writes that the $27 billion figure is &quot;premised on the &nbsp;belief that the state should carry forward all current spending and assumptions regarding program growth.&quot; He adds that policy advocates touting the figure are simply tallying agencies&rsquo; wish lists; his post links to a <a href=\"http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/External_Links/LAR_82R/Agency_LAR_Listing_82R.htm\">Legislative Budget Board website</a> compiling requests filed by more than 200 agencies. Heflin&rsquo;s post continues: &quot;But these requests are almost never fully funded -- even at the start of the budget process -- because they include many unnecessary spending items that appropriators recognize and quickly weed out.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeeking the basis of the $27 billion figure, we contacted McCown, who pointed us to his Jan. 10 statement saying that based solely on requests from several major agencies and expected formula-driven costs of higher education, Texas needs to spend $19.9 billion more in state funds in 2012-13 than what&rsquo;s budgeted for 2010-11. That would bump the budget to $99 billion, McCown said, which exceeds Combs&rsquo; estimate of available state revenue by $27 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to his statement, the center reached the $19.9 billion figure by adding up requested budget increases tied to population and cost growth made by five agencies -- the Texas Education Agency ($9 billion increase), the Texas Health and Human Services Commission ($8.3 billion increase), the Texas Department of Criminal Justice ($730 million increase), the Employees Retirement System ($576 million increase) and Teacher Retirement System of Texas ($908 million increase). It then added increases for public colleges and universities that would be driven by state higher-education funding formulas, McCown&rsquo;s statement says. All told, the statement says, the selected agencies and education institutions account for 82 percent of state spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFootnotes to the center&rsquo;s summary of its calculations indicate that more than $8 billion in the identified education and health and human services funding is needed to replace federal stimulus aid used in the last budget but not expected again this year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEva DeLuna Castro, the center&rsquo;s senior budget analyst, said she excluded some of the selected agencies&rsquo; requests, such as one for staffing a health center for prisoners, that don&rsquo;t reflect what the agencies are already doing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an interview, McCown said those who question the shortfall &quot;are not being honest. They&rsquo;re trying to confuse the public . . . We&rsquo;re short $27 billion to do what we&rsquo;re doing. Obviously, if you don&rsquo;t want to do what we&rsquo;re doing, then we&rsquo;re not short.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the <em>Statesman</em>, state leaders including GOP Gov. Rick Perry are dismissive of needing to cover $27 billion in additional spending. Perry said in a Jan. 10 interview with the newspaper: &quot;I&#39;ll let somebody else talk about that, because that&#39;s not reality.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the end, we suppose, the final budget and its impact will determine reality.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut that&rsquo;s down the road. For now, what legislative budget-writers have to go on are what they always have early in the process: State agencies&rsquo; self-reported funding needs. And for now, it looks like the cost to continue services as they are exceeds the $27 billion suggested by the CPPP&#39;s analysis, which did not consider all agency requests.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, we followed up with Heflin, who said in an interview that he composed his post before reading McCown&rsquo;s numerical analysis. Heflin said he has no quibble with its methodology, but disputes the premise that lawmakers should maintain existing services. When &quot;you know you don&rsquo;t have the money, you know you have to trim back,&quot; Heflin said. He followed up via e-mail: &quot;There was never a possibility of funding a current-services&rsquo; budget plus wish lists and growth.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur sense: Heflin&rsquo;s statement rejects a shortfall calculation that seems a reasonable way to estimate how much it would cost Texas to keep up services. We rate the statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-01-11T19:46:55.725583", "ruling_date": "2011-01-12T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Talmadge Heflin says claims that state government is $27 billion in the red are false", "ruling_headline_slug": "talmadge-heflin-says-claims-state-government-27-bi", "ruling_link_text": "Based on subset of agency budget requests, actually", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<em>Austin American-Statesman</em>, news article, <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/texas-politics/texas-revenue-still-lagging-despite-economic-recovery-1177223.html\">&quot;Texas&#39; revenue still lagging despite economic recovery,&quot;</a> Jan. 10, 2011 (viewed Jan. 11, 2011)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/01112011_fscottmccownresponsepftexas.html\">E-mail</a>, response to PolitiFact Texas, F.
