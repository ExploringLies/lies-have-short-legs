Mitt Romney took a shot at President Barack Obama&rsquo;s trade policies.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;We have to open up markets for our goods,&quot; Romney said. &quot;We haven&#39;t done that under this president. European nations and China over the last three years have opened up 44 different trade relationships with various nations in the&nbsp;world. This president has opened up none.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe won&rsquo;t check the claim about European and Chinese trade deals here, but we will look at whether&nbsp;Romney is correct about Obama&rsquo;s record on trade agreements.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter lengthy negotiations, Obama <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/10/21/president-obama-signs-historic-legislation-signaling-progress-trade-and-jobs\">signed trade&nbsp;agreements</a> with&nbsp;three separate nations on Oct. 21, 2011 -- <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/12/03/statement-president-announcing-us-korea-trade-agreement\">South Korea</a>, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/06/fact-sheets-us-colombia-trade-agreement-and-action-plan\">Colombia</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/19/fact-sheets-us-panama-trade-promotion-agreement\">Panama</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese were not trivial deals. The one with South Korea, in particular, was &quot;the largest trade deal since 1994,&quot; when the U.S. approved the North American Free Trade Agreement, Bloomberg News <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-18/obama-to-sign-south-korea-colombia-panama-trade-deals-oct-21.html\">reported</a> at the time, citing administration data. The South Korea deal was poised to increase U.S. export access &quot;for everything from cars to farm goods,&quot; Bloomberg wrote.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAll three deals were initially forged under President George W. Bush, but Bush was unable to get the deals past a Democratic-controlled Congress.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter the GOP took control of Congress in the 2010 midterm elections, Congressional Republicans pointed to the proposed deals as rare areas of possible cooperation between the two parties. But implementation negotiations&nbsp;initially stalled amid administration insistence on securing protections for workers. During the 2008 campaign, Obama had <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/8/include-environmental-and-labor-standards-in-trade/\">promised</a>&nbsp;to &quot;use trade agreements to spread good labor and environmental standards around the world.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEven though negotiations with lawmakers dragged on, the administration was ultimately able to secure a legislative formulation that could garner enough votes to pass. Doing so required some political risk for the president with his own base, since a sizable faction within his own party is skeptical of expanding free trade agreements.&nbsp;(Public Citizen, a group that opposed all three agreements, produced&nbsp;a <a href=\"http://www.citizen.org/documents/g20-korea-obama-comparison-memo.pdf\">detailed</a><a href=\"http://www.citizen.org/documents/g20-korea-obama-comparison-memo.pdf\"> comparison</a> of what&nbsp;Obama promised and what the trade agreement with South Korea contains.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe asked&nbsp;the Romney camp&nbsp;for their view, and&nbsp;a spokesman said that Romney was&nbsp;referring to&nbsp;new&nbsp;deals initiated and completed&nbsp;by this administration, rather than&nbsp;deals&nbsp;initiated&nbsp;during the previous administration and closed by Obama. But we think that&#39;s&nbsp;a misleading standard.&nbsp;If that&#39;s what Romney&nbsp;means, he&#39;s effectively&nbsp;stripping Obama of any credit for enactment&nbsp;of&nbsp;the three trade agreements, when in fact&nbsp;bringing them to fruition&nbsp;required significant negotiating efforts&nbsp;with lawmakers of&nbsp;the opposite party (and led to an achievement&nbsp;that eluded his predecessor, Bush).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt did take the better part of three years for Obama and Congress to enact the languishing South Korea, Colombia and Panama trade agreements. But ultimately he did reach an accord with lawmakers that enabled the agreements&rsquo; relatively easy passage in both the House and the Senate, including strong support from Republicans as well as the votes of several dozen Democratic lawmakers. To say of &quot;trade relationships&quot; that Obama &quot;has opened up none&quot; deserves a&nbsp;rating&nbsp;of&nbsp;False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-08T16:14:19.736729", "ruling_date": "2012-01-08T16:53:44", "ruling_headline": "Mitt Romney says Barack Obama didn't expand U.S. trade deals", "ruling_headline_slug": "mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-didnt-expand-us-trad", "ruling_link_text": "That omits deals with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tABC News-WMUR-Yahoo debate, Manchester, N.H., Jan. 7, 2012, accessed via CQ Transcriptswire (subscribers only)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhite House, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/10/21/president-obama-signs-historic-legislation-signaling-progress-trade-and-jobs\">President Obama Signs Historic Legislation Signaling Progress on Trade and Jobs</a>,&quot; Oct. 21, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBloomberg News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-18/obama-to-sign-south-korea-colombia-panama-trade-deals-oct-21.html\">Obama to Sign South Korea, Colombia, Panama Trade Deals Oct. 21</a>,&quot; Oct. 18, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/8/include-environmental-and-labor-standards-in-trade/\">Congress approves final agreements</a>,&quot; Oct. 13, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. House of Representatives, <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll783.xml\">vote on Korea trade agreement</a>, Oct. 12, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. House of Representatives, <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll781.xml\">vote on Colombia trade agreement</a>, Oct. 12, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. House of Representatives, <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll782.xml\">vote on Panama trade agreement</a>, Oct. 12, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. Senate, vote<a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00161\"> on Korea trade agreement,</a>Oct. 12, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. Senate, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00163\">vote on Colombia trade agreement</a>, Oct. 12, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. Senate, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00162\">vote on Panama trade agreement</a>, Oct. 12, 2011&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 34, "current_job": "Former governor", "false_count": 32, "first_name": "Mitt", "half_true_count": 58, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 5, "last_name": "Romney", "mostly_true_count": 33, "name_slug": "mitt-romney", "pants_count": 19, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-mittromney.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/5/", "total_count": 221, "true_count": 30, "website": "http://www.mittromney.com/"}, "statement": "<div style=\"background-color: transparent\">\r\n\t<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.28379810554906726\" style=\"font-weight: normal\">Says President Barack Obama has opened up no new trade relationships with other nations.</b></div>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H.", "statement_date": "2012-01-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 214, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/214/", "subject": "New Hampshire 2012", "subject_slug": "new-hampshire-2012", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 143, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/143/", "subject": "Trade", "subject_slug": "trade", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
