Charlie Crist would return donations they made when he was the  Republican candidate for U.S. Senate were in for a rude awakening on  May 12, 2010, when Crist made it clear he is keeping their money.<br /> <br /> \"People  gave to a good cause and we're going to spend it on a good cause,\"  Crist told reporters outside of the Pinellas County Supervisor of  Elections Office, after changing his registration from Republican to no  party affiliation.\"That's why I'm going to keep it. It's important to be  able to get our message out and communicate with the people of  Florida.\" <br /> <br /> The decision to hold on to nearly $10 million in  campaign donations prompted cries that Crist was flip-flopping -- like <a href=\"http://www.rpof.org/article.php?id=924\" target=\"_blank\">this statement</a> from  the Republican Party of Florida, or this <a href=\"http://www.marcorubio.com/rubio-for-senate-releases-new-web-video-take-the-money-and-run/\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> on the campaign website for Republican senate candidate Marco Rubio.<br /> <br /> While  Crist may have earned a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/apr/29/charlie-crist/crist-flip-flops-promise-run-republican-independen/\" target=\"_blank\">Full-Flop</a> on our Flip-O-Meter for switching parties to bolster his Senate bid, we  wondered whether Crist flip-flopped on giving refunds.<br /> <br /> Let's  start with what Crist said about refunding donations before he made his  independent run official on April 29, 2010.<br /> <br /> <strong>April 26,  speaking to reporters in Miami.</strong><br /> <br /> <em>Reporter: Will you return Republican donor  money, Republican Party money since you received that money as a  Republican?<br /> <br /> Crist: You know, I think that's a decision that you  have to make if you made a decision to go independent. I haven't made  that decision yet.</em><br /> <br /> Crist also had this response for <em>St.  Petersburg Times</em> political editor Adam C. Smith when asked about  refunding the donations:<em>\"Anybody has the right and the opportunity  to  ask. I think we spent it though.\"<br /> </em><br /> Next we'll look at what he said  after announcing he would leave the Republican Party. Four days later,  Crist appeared before a national audience on MSNBC's <em>Morning Joe</em>.<br /> <br /> <strong>April  30, interview with Joe Scarborough on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\"</strong><br /> <br /> <em>Scarborough:  \"There are a lot of Republicans that are going to be asking you to give  them the money back they gave you when you were running as a  Republican, are you going to give them that money back or are you going  to keep it?\"<br /> <br /> Crist: \"Well, No. 1, nobody's asked me yet. Not one  person has asked me yet. And I think they realize that the reality is  they gave it to my campaign, they gave it to me in order to espouse the  ideas I believe in.\"<br /> <br /> Scarborough: \"If they ask for money back,  will you give it back to them or will you keep it for the campaign?\"<br /> </em><br /> <em>Crist:  \"Ah, probably give it back to them. It's not that big a deal. What  really matters is we're able to communicate our message.\"</em><br /> <br /> So it's  pretty clear in those comments that Crist favors returning the  donations. But before we make our Flip-O-Meter ruling, here's what Crist  said about two weeks later:<br /> <br /> <strong>May 12, speaking to reporters  outside of the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections office when  registering as no party affiliation.</strong><br /> <br /> <em>\"People gave to a good cause  and we're going to spend it on a good cause,\" Crist told reporters.  \"That's why I'm going to keep it. It's important to be able to get our  message out and communicate with the people of Florida.\" </em><br /> <br /> The  same day, Crist campaign spokeswoman Michelle Todd made it clear to  reporters that the money was non-refundable at this point.<br /> <br /> <em>\"We  have never made an official statement before,\" Todd said, in an  interview with Miami Herald political reporter Beth Reinhard. \"It is now  the official statement. They donated to the Charlie Crist for U.S.  Senate campaign and it's still the Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate  campaign.\"</em><br /> <br /> Crist explained his decision a day later in a meeting  with the<em> St. Petersburg Times</em> editorial board. He was asked if there  would have been any downside to returning the money: \"Probably wouldn't  be. ... I want it. I need it. I want to win.\"<br /> <br /> And one last note,  as he opened his campaign headquarters in St. Petersburg on May 15,  Crist was heckled by someone in the crowd who asked, \"What about the  guys who gave you money when you were a Republican?!\"<br /> <br /> \"I'm going  to keep it!\" Crist cheerfully responded, drawing roars of approval.  (Watch the <em>St. Petersburg Times'</em> <a href=\"http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/2010/05/charlie-crist-heckled-at-hq-opening-video.html\" target=\"_blank\">video   here and check out his wink</a> around 3:10 into the clip.)</p>\r\n<p>We  should point out that Crist has returned some campaign donations,  according to reports filed with the Federal Elections Commission, but  for a different reason. He returned $76,250 in donations from the Fort  Lauderdale law firm of Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein to a bankruptcy  trustee, and another $9,600 from Rothstein and his wife to the U.S.  Marshall's office.<span id=\":2qu\" dir=\"ltr\"> Also, Republican donor Al Hoffman got his $4,800 returned in February because of allegations of excessive spending by the Republican Party of Florida and Crist's hand-picked chairman Jim Greer.</span></p>\r\n<p>So in less than three weeks, Crist went from  telling reporters he had yet to make a decision on running for  indepedent, to running as an independent and \"probably\" giving the money  back, to \"officially\" declaring he would keep the money. <br /> <br /> Our  main issue is Crist's use of the word \"probably\" during his <em>Morning Joe</em> interview. The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines probably as  \"insofar as seems reasonably true, factual, or to be expected: without  much doubt.\"<br /> <br /> Crist said he would \"probably give it back to them,\"  leading donors to believe that as the dictionary states it was \"to be  expected\" or \"without much doubt\" that they would see some of their cash  back from Crist.<br /> <br /> We find Crist completely changed his position  from entertaining the idea of giving the money back, to definitely not  giving the money back.
