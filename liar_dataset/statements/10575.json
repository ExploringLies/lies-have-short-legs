Rick Scott used his annual opening address to the 2015 Legislature to talk about some of his favorite subjects -- taxes, business and his newfound penchant for spending more on education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2015/mar/03/rick-scotts-2015-state-state-speech-annotated/\">SEE RICK SCOTT&#39;S STATE OF THE STATE SPEECH ANNOTATED.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If we are going to out-compete the world, we must invest in K-12 education,&quot; <a href=\"http://thefloridachannel.org/videos/3315-state-of-the-state-address-by-governor-rick-scott/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>he said</u></a>. &quot;This year, we are recommending an increase in K-12 funding to $50 above the historic level to $7,176 per student.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a change from Scott&rsquo;s first year in office, when he recommended the Legislature slash $3.3 billion out of the education budget as Florida&rsquo;s budget floundered during the recession. (They eventually cut $1.3 billion.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has since reversed course, recommending additional funding each year as tax revenues and the state&#39;s economy rebounded. Let&rsquo;s check the numbers to see if Scott&rsquo;s per-pupil spending really is a historic high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Accounting for education</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>K-12 education gets most of its money through the Florida Education Finance Program, a combination of state and local funding. School districts contribute property tax dollars, called the &quot;required local effort,&quot; at a rate set by the state. Florida received federal stimulus dollars a couple of recent years, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Total education spending became a flashpoint during the 2014 campaign when challenger and former Gov. Charlie Crist attacked Scott&rsquo;s education spending. Scott responded by saying he now oversaw the highest education budget in state spending. But that was only true in total dollars, not per-pupil spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Crist said he held the record for spending per student, which many education advocates have said is a better method for measuring, Scott said he would raise the 2015-16 number to $50 higher than Crist&rsquo;s record. That led to this year&rsquo;s budget recommendation, which asks the Legislature for a $19.75 billion K-12 budget, working out to $7,176 per student. To keep track of it, let&rsquo;s look at this table:</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\">\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:none; width:600px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Fiscal year</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>K-12 budget (total)</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Per pupil spending</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2007-08 (Crist)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$18.7 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$7,126</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2008-09 (Crist)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$17.9 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$6,846</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2009-10 (Crist)*</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$18 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$6,846</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2010-11 (Crist)*</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$18.2 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$6,897</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2011-12 (Scott)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$16.6 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$6,217</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2012-13 (Scott)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$17.2 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$6,376</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2013-14 (Scott)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$18.3 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$6,769</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2014-15 (Scott)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$18.9 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$6,915</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2015-16 (Scott -- &nbsp;recommended)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$19.75 billion</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$7,176</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The two years marked with an asterisk were years when Florida raked in about $900 million each in federal stimulus money to keep the budget afloat. Also note that for 2015-16, Scott&rsquo;s proposal is a recommendation only; the Legislature ultimately will decide school funding levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note some other caveats about Scott&rsquo;s increased spending: First of all, remember that Florida schools have more students now than they did when Crist was in office. A current student total won&rsquo;t be available until enrollments for next year are finished and added up, but in 2014-15 there were somewhere around 100,000 more students than in 2007. Overall spending would have to go up just to keep pace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, even though proposed spending could be increased $50, that hardly keeps up with the inflation realized in the eight-year span since Crist was in office. According to the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index inflation calculator</u></a> (an imperfect measure, to be sure, but a good benchmark), Scott would have to increase spending by&nbsp;an additional $850 or so to even match what per-pupil spending was in 2007. When we account for inflation, 2007&rsquo;s $7,126 per-student funding comes out to $8,032 today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott said his recommendation of education funding of $7,176 per student is a &quot;historic level.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s accurate only if you don&rsquo;t account for inflation, which has ticked up each year since the previous per-student spending high in 2007-08.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim is partially accurate.&nbsp;We rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-03-03T14:41:52.458956", "ruling_date": "2015-03-03T15:23:34", "ruling_headline": "Rick Scott calls proposed per pupil spending 'historic'", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-calls-proposed-pupil-spending-historic", "ruling_link_text": "Still behind 2007 if you account for inflation", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Rick Scott, <a href=\"http://thefloridachannel.org/videos/3315-state-of-the-state-address-by-governor-rick-scott/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>State of the State address</u></a>, March 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/jul/18/charlie-crist/rick-scotts-student-spending-about-200-less-during/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Rick Scott&#39;s student spending is &#39;about $200 less&#39; than during recession, Charlie Crist says</u></a>,&quot; July 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/oct/06/republican-party-florida/rick-scott-holds-record-education-funding-republic/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Does Rick Scott hold the record on education funding, as Republicans say?</u></a>,&quot; Oct. 6, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/gov-rick-scott-unveils-plan-to-boost-floridas-per-student-spending/2213329\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Gov.
