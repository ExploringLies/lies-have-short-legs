Ron Johnson and former Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, the volley of attacks is at full speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two candidates met separately with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board. About 40 minutes into his visit, &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/journalsentinel/videos/10154753195568816/\">Feingold offered a series of issues</a> he believes Johnson has overlooked, including climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson &quot;doesn&#39;t even believe that there&#39;s a man-made role in climate change,&quot; Feingold said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later in the meeting, he added climate change &quot;is an issue that was bipartisan before people like Senator Johnson were elected and started saying absolute nonsense about sunspots and other reasons to avoid the issue.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether Feingold is right that Johnson has denied a human role in climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Johnson&rsquo;s record</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Johnson and Feingold first ran against each other in 2010, Johnson <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/100814454.html\">definitively told</a> the Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s editorial board his position at the time: &nbsp;&quot;I absolutely do not believe in the science of man-caused climate change. It&rsquo;s not proven by any stretch of the imagination.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The far more likely cause, he said, &nbsp;is &quot;sunspot activity or something just in the geologic eons of time where we have changes in the climate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ben Voelkel, a Johnson campaign spokesman, told us Johnson later acknowledged humans played a role in climate change in a 2014 interview with Boston Public Radio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are other forces that cause climate to change,&quot; Johnson told Here and Now&rsquo;s Robin Young. &quot;So climate does change and I don&rsquo;t deny that man has some effect on that. It certainly has a great deal of effect on spoiling our environment in many different ways.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Johnson softened his view as soon as the next sentence: &quot;I&rsquo;ve got a very open mind, but I don&rsquo;t have the arrogance that man can really do much to affect climate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next year, Johnson <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00012\">voted against a Senate amendment</a> to affirm that human activity significantly contributes to climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While all but one senator supported an earlier amendment affirming the existence of climate change, only five Republicans this time voted to acknowledge there is a human impact. The amendment, seen as a symbolic effort by the Democrats to force GOP senators to take a position, failed 50 to 49 (it required a 3/5 majority).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, an energy policy position that <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150415040356/http://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/energy\">appeared on Johnson&rsquo;s campaign website in 2015</a> questioned human&rsquo;s impact on climate change:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Man-made global warming remains unsettled science. World-renowned climate experts have raised serious objections to the theories behind these claims. I believe it is a bad idea to impose a policy that will raise taxes on every American, will balloon energy prices and will hurt our economic competiveness (sic) &ndash; especially on such uncertain predictions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That passage has since been removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August 2016, when <a href=\"http://www.wrjn.com/episode/ron-johnson-u-s-senator-r-wi/\">asked about global warming on WRJN-AM radio in Racine</a>, Johnson seemed to think it settled &mdash; before tempering his response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Listen, man can affect the environment; no doubt about it,&quot; he said. &quot;The climate has always changed, it always will. &hellip; The question is, how much does man cause changes in our environment, changes in our climate, and what we could possibly even do about it?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Feingold made the claim, Johnson&rsquo;s statements have been a similarly mixed bag:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He called himself a &quot;skeptic&quot; of man-made climate change in a meeting with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s editorial board Oct. 21, 2016. He <a href=\"http://www.weau.com/content/news/Sen-Ron-Johnson-downplays-climate-change-398326421.html\">downplayed the issue</a> of global warming three days later &mdash; saying mankind flourishes in warmer weather &mdash; while admitting humans &quot;obviously&quot; play a role. But these statements aren&rsquo;t relevant to a claim made weeks earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold said Johnson &quot;doesn&#39;t even believe that there&#39;s a man-made role in climate change.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson did not support a Senate amendment to acknowledge a man-made role in climate change and expressed skepticism each of the few times he acknowledged humans might contribute. He has acknowledged at times that humans can play a role but downplayed how significant that role might be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is accurate but needs additional clarification, our rating is Mostly True.</p> <a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7ea29645-7850-49e8-9a39-5f24dedffe12\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7ea29645-7850-49e8-9a39-5f24dedffe12</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-28T17:27:55.017508", "ruling_date": "2016-10-31T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Russ Feingold says Ron Johnson doesn't believe 'there's a man-made role in climate change'", "ruling_headline_slug": "russ-feingold-says-ron-johnson-doesnt-believe-ther", "ruling_link_text": "Hedges, then unhedges", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/journalsentinel/videos/10154753195568816/\">Feingold&rsquo;s interview with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board</a>, October 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Michael Tyler, Feingold campaign, October 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Ben Voelkel, Johnson campaign, October 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/100814454.html\">Sunspots are behind climate change, Johnson says</a>&quot;, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, August 16, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00012\">Senate Amendment roll call</a>, January 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150415040356/http://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/energy\">Energy policy summary on Johnson&rsquo;s website</a> as of April 15, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wrjn.com/episode/ron-johnson-u-s-senator-r-wi/\">Johnson&rsquo;s interview on WRJN</a>, August 1, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/journalsentinel/videos/10154807487158816/\">Johnson&rsquo;s interview with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board</a>, October 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/100814454.html\">Sen.
