Marco Rubio, R-Fla., once compared watching our national debt to waiting for the killer to appear during a<a href=\"http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=218eea15-2d7d-4f54-a5e0-80b5f8c64cb1\"><u> horror movie</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You know those movies where the people in the audience are screaming, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go in that door!&rsquo; because you know the killer is there? Well, it is the same thing with this debt,&quot; Rubio said during a Jacksonville radio station interview in 2012. &quot;We know how this ends.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scary stuff indeed. Rubio returned to talk about our killer debt during a speech at the conservative American Enterprise Institute Nov. 20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To lift the sequester we must find a real, lasting solution to the true cause of our growing national debt: the unsustainable path of important programs like Medicare and Social Security,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the question and answer session, Rubio mentioned the sequester again:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This notion that the sequester is just going to vanish and people are going to wake up, unfortunately, is unrealistic. I did not support the sequester. I do not believe that&rsquo;s the right way to balance a budget. I just think it&#39;s better than tax increases, as bad as the sequester may be.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to turn the clock back and review Rubio&rsquo;s actions and words that related to the sequester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The path to the sequester</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio, a former state legislator, propelled himself into the national spotlight running for U.S. Senate in 2010. During the campaign, he raised alarms about federal spending and &quot;mountains of debt for our children.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He continued that theme once elected to office.

In March 2011, he made a flurry of national media appearances and penned an op-ed in the <em><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704425804576220670543010068\"><u>Wall Street Journal</u></a></em> to announce he would vote against raising the debt limit &quot;unless it is the last one we ever authorize and is accompanied by a plan for fundamental tax reform, an overhaul of our regulatory structure, a cut to discretionary spending, a balanced-budget amendment, and reforms to save Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio gave props to a plan by Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., to lower and simplify tax rates, close loopholes, and make permanent low rates on capital gains and dividends. He also gave a shout out to House Republicans for their budget plan, which he said would lower discretionary spending by <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/261805/862-billion-over-10-years-andrew-stiles\"><u>$862 billion </u></a>over 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interview with Florida reporters, Rubio said lawmakers should consider raising the retirement age for Social Security, but not for people currently near retirement. Rubio has also called for reducing &quot;non-defense, non-veterans&quot; spending to <a href=\"http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/spending\"><u>2008 levels</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Rubio, a freshman Republican in the minority in the Senate, didn&rsquo;t have much sway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the summer of 2011, President Barack Obama and Congress entered a high-stakes stand-off over the debt limit. House Republicans insisted on spending cuts before increasing the debt limit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama and House Speaker John Boehner tried unsuccessfully to reach a &quot;grand bargain,&quot; a specific plan<strong> </strong>to put the federal budget on more stable footing. When that failed, they arrived at the less ambitious Budget Control Act of 2011. The House passed the bill 269-161. In the Senate, it passed 74-26 with <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00123\"><u>Rubio voting &lsquo;&rsquo;no&rsquo;&rsquo;</u></a> on Aug. 2, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law included about $1.2 trillion in future budget cuts, but it also directed Congress to find another $1.2 trillion via a bipartisan &quot;supercommittee.&quot; As further incentive, the law had a threat: If a supercommittee couldn&rsquo;t agree on a package, or if Congress voted down the supercommittee proposal, a sequester would automatically go into effect, putting in place nearly across-the-board budget cuts, with half coming from defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio released a <a href=\"http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=79c35d64-a1fd-447b-8fab-be4bae308268\"><u>statement</u></a> about his vote against the measure: &quot;I cannot support this plan because it fails to actually solve our debt problem, fails to diminish the risk of a credit rating downgrade and is not a long-term solution to avert a debt crisis.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio wrote that the plan failed to immediately downsize government and ignored &quot;the biggest driver of our debt, health care spending.&quot; Rubio also wrote that he feared the vote would lead to consideration of big tax hikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And if Congress rejects new taxes, then up to $850 billion of devastating automatic defense spending cuts would be triggered at a time when the world is as dangerous as it&rsquo;s ever been,&quot; he wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Obama and Boehner supported the plan, and despite Rubio&rsquo;s no vote, it passed Congress with bipartisan majorities. The supercommittee deadlocked, though, so it never proposed new cuts. That&rsquo;s what led to the sequester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After it was clear the supercommittee couldn&rsquo;t reach agreement, Rubio was among a group of Republican senators who tried to prevent defense from being subject to the sequester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Defense funding should be driven by our national security needs, not by arbitrary fiscal arithmetic,&quot; said the senators in a <a href=\"http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=3d9f6f83-c952-153a-f409-1742bc73a72b\"><u>December 2011 statement</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sequester officially started in March 2013 and led to multiple claims about the impact on <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/may/14/fact-checking-more-claims-about-sequester/\"><u>Head Start, airports and wacky spending</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lawmakers found plenty of fodder to criticize about the sequester and Rubio was no exception. In July 2013, Rubio wrote an op-ed criticizing the fact that the sequester grounded the Navy&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.pnj.com/article/20130714/OPINION/307140002\"><u>Blue Angels</u></a> from an event in Pensacola.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Blues were grounded this weekend all because of a feckless decision made two years ago more than 900 miles away in Washington, D.C.&quot; Rubio wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio repeated that he opposed the sequester and wanted limited to spending in a floor<a href=\"http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=c5a63112-500c-41bd-b21f-bbed1f371d4c\"><u> speech</u></a> in July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I do not dispute that it (the sequester) will have an impact. In fact, I voted against the deal that actually gave us the sequester, and I voted against it because, while I believe deeply we need to constrain spending because we are spending a lot more money than we are taking in, about $1 trillion a year more than we are taking in, borrowing about 40 cents of every dollar we spend in the federal government -- for the folks visiting here in the gallery, you may be shocked to hear that. Every dollar the federal government spends, 40 cents of it is borrowed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2013, Florida federal courts officials held a video conference with aides to Rubio and U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., to talk about the impact of the sequester on the courts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brooke Sammon, Rubio&#39;s deputy press secretary, said then that Rubio &quot;has always said that the sequester was a bad idea, in part because it does not prioritize core public safety functions. The only way to solve our long-term deficit problems is to grow our economy, which will require entitlement reform and pro-growth tax reform, not tax hikes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said &quot;I did not support the sequester.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio voted &quot;no&quot; on the Budget Control Act in 2011 that paved the path toward the sequester in March 2013. He said at the time that he voted &quot;no&quot; because the law &quot;fails to actually solve our debt problem, fails to diminish the risk of a credit rating downgrade and is not a long-term solution to avert a debt crisis.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-26T15:16:39.626882", "ruling_date": "2013-11-26T16:44:13", "ruling_headline": "Marco Rubio says he never supported the sequester", "ruling_headline_slug": "marco-rubio-says-he-never-supported-sequester", "ruling_link_text": "A consistent 'no'", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>U.S. Sen.
