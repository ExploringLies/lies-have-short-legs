That means he got a cheesesteak from Geno&rsquo;s in Philly and, true to Western PA form, he went to get a Smiley Cookie (yes, that&rsquo;s the name of something, and it&rsquo;s trademarked) while he was outside Pittsburgh this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Trump left town,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/photos/a.488852220724.393301.153080620724/10157865258150725/?type=3&amp;theater\">a post appeared on his Facebook page:</a>&nbsp;&quot;Stopped by Smiley Cookie to pick up some great cookies for the family, along with Rudy [Giuliani].&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the popular chain of diners headquartered in Homestead outside Pittsburgh is actually not called Smiley Cookie, despite its most famous food offering. No, the chain is actually called &quot;Eat&rsquo;n Park.&quot; Sure, this isn&rsquo;t about foreign or domestic policy. But it&rsquo;s important to Pennsylvania, so we decided to check Trump&rsquo;s claim of swinging by a place called &quot;Smiley Cookie.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GOP presidential nominee held a rally <a href=\"http://theincline.com/2016/10/10/trump-twirls-terrible-towel-promises-return-of-steel-as-supporters-and-protesters-divide-ambridge/\">at Ambridge Area High School</a> about 20 miles northwest of Pittsburgh Monday, his first since coming under fire following the release of audio from 2005 of Trump&rsquo;s using offensive language referring to women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wpxi.com/news/politics/supporters-lining-up-ahead-of-trump-appearance-in-ambridge/453903143\">Local TV station WPXI reported</a>&nbsp;that after the rally had wrapped up, Trump and members of his campaign traveled to Moon Township, where they stopped at an Eat&rsquo;n Park. Trump and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a top ally of the presidential nominee, reportedly bought a dozen Smiley Cookies while there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Eat&rsquo;n Park&rsquo;s corporate website, the establishment was founded in 1949 &quot;as the first Pittsburgh-area drive-in with carhops.&quot; Today, it&rsquo;s more like just a diner, but it has more than 65 locations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The restaurants serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, but the most famous part is the bakery, where employees whip up pies, cakes and, of course, hand-frosted Smiley Cookies that are given to children who eat at the restaurant. They&rsquo;re also available for purchase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat&rsquo;n Park has been doling out the Smiley Cookies for the last 30 years, and the restaurant itself has become a western Pennsylvania institution of sorts, as it&rsquo;s one of the only 24-hour joints still around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some on social media reacted harshly to Trump&rsquo;s mix-up, while others were more understanding. The Smiley Cookie<em>&nbsp;is</em>&nbsp;the most iconic part of Eat&rsquo;n Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat&rsquo;n Park Hospitality Group and the Trump campaign didn&rsquo;t respond to a request for comment Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump posted on Facebook that he &quot;Stopped by Smiley Cookie to pick up some great cookies for the family, along with Rudy.&quot; We&rsquo;ll leave deciding whether or not the cookies can be considered &quot;great&quot; to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this place is not called Smiley Cookie. It&rsquo;s called Eat&rsquo;n Park. And it has been called that for 67 years. The mix-up&rsquo;s understandable, though, and Trump did purchase the Smiley Cookies in question. We rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/55743655-7a4a-4186-84f8-2fe48eadaa6d\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/55743655-7a4a-4186-84f8-2fe48eadaa6d</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-11T10:52:34.843136", "ruling_date": "2016-10-11T10:59:16", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump confuses Eat\u2019n Park with its famous Smiley Cookie", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-confuses-eatn-park-its-famous-smiley-", "ruling_link_text": ":(", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>News article.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wpxi.com/news/politics/supporters-lining-up-ahead-of-trump-appearance-in-ambridge/453903143\">&quot;Supporters, protesters greet Donald Trump in Ambridge.&quot;</a>&nbsp;WPXI.
