Scott Walker&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf\">budget-repair bill</a>. The senators said they fled because the bill -- which would strip away most collective bargaining rights from most public employees -- was being rushed to a vote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo days later, Walker called on them to return, suggesting in a <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=227474\">statement</a> that they were being hypocritical.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;These are many of the same senators who, two years ago, rammed through a billion-dollar tax hike in 24 hours with no public input,&quot; Walker declared.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker repeated the call for the Senate Democrats to return in his televised <a href=\"http://walker.wi.gov/journal_media_detail.asp?prid=5631&amp;locid=177\">&quot;fireside chat&quot;</a> on Feb. 22, 2011, about the budget stalemate. And numerous readers have asked us to sort out this piece of the debate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we will.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Walker&rsquo;s spokesman, Cullen Werwie, to explain the governor&rsquo;s charge. He said the reference was to a <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2009/data/SB62hst.html\">budget-repair </a><a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2009/data/SB62hst.html\">bill</a> introduced by Walker&rsquo;s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, in 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe content of Doyle&rsquo;s and Walker&rsquo;s repair bills -- which were needed midyear to balance the state budget -- are different, but the scenarios are similar.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Doyle bill was approved by a Democratic-controlled Legislature under a Democratic governor. Conversely, Republican Walker introduced his bill to an Assembly and Senate that are controlled by the GOP.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Ironically, the Wisconsin 14 fled two years to the day after the Doyle bill was introduced.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s statement has three major points:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWho was involved<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker is correct in saying &quot;many of the same senators&quot; who retreated to Illinois voted for Doyle&rsquo;s 2009 budget-repair bill. Indeed, <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2009/data/votes/sv0017.pdf\">12 of the 14 did</a>; the only two who didn&rsquo;t, <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=Senate&amp;district=15&amp;display=bio\">Tim </a><a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=Senate&amp;district=15&amp;display=bio\">Cullen</a> of Janesville and <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=Senate&amp;district=7&amp;display=bio\">Chris </a><a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=Senate&amp;district=7&amp;display=bio\">Larson</a> of Milwaukee, weren&rsquo;t elected until November 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat the bill involved<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWas the Doyle bill &quot;a billion-dollar tax hike&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found in a previous <a href=\"http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/05/jeff-fitzgerald/jeff-fitzgerald-says-gov-jim-doyle-and-democrats-r/\">PolitiFact Wisconsin </a><a href=\"http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/05/jeff-fitzgerald/jeff-fitzgerald-says-gov-jim-doyle-and-democrats-r/\">item</a> that assessed the bill and how it was adopted that taxes, per se, would only be raised by an estimated $290 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, if a new fee on hospital revenue was included -- and news reports often referred to the fee as a tax -- the take would be an estimated $1.2 billion over three years. Doyle and Democrats argued the change was welcomed by hospitals and allowed the hospitals &nbsp;to bring in a greater amount in federal money. But it was real money filling a real hole.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Walker&rsquo;s claim of a billion-dollar tax hike is essentially accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow it was adopted<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWas Doyle&rsquo;s bill &quot;rammed through&quot; in &quot;24 hours with no public input&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAgain, Walker is essentially correct. No public hearing was held on Doyle&rsquo;s bill, which was <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2009/data/SB62hst.html\">approved</a> by the Legislature the day after it was introduced.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs Walker suggested, the <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2009/data/votes/sv0017.pdf\">Senate </a><a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2009/data/votes/sv0017.pdf\">vote</a> was strictly along party lines, with all Democrats voting for the bill and all Republicans voting against it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(In the <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2009/data/votes/av0058.pdf\">Assembly</a>, all but two Democrats voted yes and all Republicans voted no.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis is one budget-repair bill debate we can bring swiftly to a close.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccused by Senate Democrats of rushing a vote on his repair bill, Walker fired back with his own charge. He said that two years earlier, many of those senators had rammed through a billion-dollar tax hike contained in a Democratic repair bill -- in 24 hours and without public input. The record is clear.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Walker&rsquo;s statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-23T16:46:28.367095", "ruling_date": "2011-02-23T15:45:16", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin Gov.
