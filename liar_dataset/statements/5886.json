Richard Lugar, a Republican known for being willing to work with Democrats. Mourdock, the former Indiana state treasurer, ran on a message demonizing bipartisanship. He beat Lugar by 20 points.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMany political analysts think Democrats have a better chance of winning the seat now that the race pits a tea party conservative against Donnelly, a moderate who favors gun rights and abortion restrictions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen he ran for re-election in 2010, Donnelly touted his credentials as an independent who opposed Pelosi on immigration and climate legislation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut did he vote for her?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Club for Growth cited House records of Donnelly&rsquo;s votes in <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll002.xml#Pelosi\">2007</a> and <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll002.xml#NV\">2009</a>. They leave no doubt: Donnelly voted for Pelosi to be speaker of the House.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2011, however, he pulled his support and voted for Rep. Heath Shuler of North Carolina.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://kokomoperspective.com/news/article_517eba56-18f7-11e0-9291-001cc4c03286.html\">In voting for Shuler</a>, Donnelly said, &quot;This afternoon, I cast my vote for Representative Heath Shuler of North Carolina for speaker of the House in the 112th Congress. I supported my friend Congressman Shuler over former Speaker Nancy Pelosi during our party&#39;s leadership elections in November citing a need for new leadership. This need remains the same. What the voters told us in the 2010 election was that they wanted a change. And I believe a moderate approach with a dedication to working across the aisle, something I know is important to both me and Congressman Shuler, is the best way forward.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublicans won a majority in the House in 2010 and elected John Boehner of Ohio to the speaker&rsquo;s post. Pelosi still won a majority of her colleagues&rsquo; support (Shuler received only 11 votes) and was elected House minority leader.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s true that in the most recent House election, he voted for someone else. But in the two previous votes -- the ones in which Democrats held a majority and had the power to choose the speaker -- Donnelly supported for Pelosi.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis statement ignored those two votes.
