For this ruling , we're zeroing in on the one that gave us the biggest workout (and we address her other statements in separate Truth-O-Meter items.)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Adams wrote: &ldquo;Bill White ... offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Who  knew? We wanted to learn more.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To back up Adams, the Republican  Party pointed us to a report updated by the Congressional Research  Service in 2006 that lists Houston among 32 localities -- Austin and  Katy were the other two in Texas -- with sanctuary policies. White was  about midway through his six years as mayor when the report came out.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Broadly,  the report states, so-called sanctuary cities &ldquo;have their roots in the  1980s religious sanctuary movement by American churches. These churches  provided sanctuary to thousands of unauthorized Central American  migrants fleeing civil war in their homelands. Most cities that are  considered sanctuary cities have adopted a &lsquo;don&rsquo;t ask-don&rsquo;t tell&rsquo; policy  where they don&rsquo;t require their employees, including law enforcement  officers, to report to federal officials aliens who may be illegally  present in the country.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The report continues:  &ldquo;Localities, and in some cases individual police departments, in such  areas that are considered &lsquo;sanctuary cities,&rsquo; have utilized various  mechanisms to ensure that unauthorized aliens who may be present in  their jurisdiction illegally are not turned in to federal authorities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The  report doesn't state why each locality made the list. Houston's  officialdom, including White and Police Chief Harold Hurtt, disputed the  characterization, noting there's no city ordinance designating Houston a  sanctuary.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A 2007 U.S. Department of Justice report  (brought to our attention by White's campaign) said its researchers  found only two jurisdictions receiving at least $1 million a year in  federal aid to incarcerate \"criminal aliens\" had official sanctuary  policies posted online--California's city and county of San Francisco  and the state of Oregon. Harris County, home to Houston, was getting  more than $2 million in annual aid at the time; presumably, it was  included in the DOJ review.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In short, Houston has  no official sanctuary policy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Still, such a city may have other policies that \"interfere or shield people from detection\"  by U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement, said Jessica Vaughan, director  of policy studies for the Washington-based Center for Immigration  Studies, which has done studies on the costs of illegal immigration.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In  fact, Houston police do not ask people what their immigration status is  during routine patrols. \"We have limited resources\" and leave it to the  federal government to enforce immigration laws, said HPD Assistant  Chief Dan Perales.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Houston is in Harris County, whose  sheriff, Adrian Garcia, likewise defends the practice of not checking  the immigration status of residents who aren't in jail. Garcia said:  \"You don&rsquo;t want to create a chill factor. You don&rsquo;t want people to spend  time wondering whether they're going to be asked about their  immigration status versus (officers) getting information on the gang  member who just shot somebody.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Other cities do the same. Austin  Police Department policy states: \"Officers will not stop persons for the  sole purpose of determining immigration status.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, Harris  County is in a federal program called 287(g) that authorizes local law  officers to enforce immigration laws. When Houston police arrest people  for crimes more serious than Class C misdemeanors, they are turned over  to the county, which was an earlier adopter of the Department of  Homeland Security's Secure Communities program. That program enables  fingerprints of arrested individuals to be checked against federal crime  and immigration databases.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After the shooting of a Houston police officer by an illegal immigrant in March 2009, White asked the federal government to expedite the city&rsquo;s entry into the 287(g) program, according to The Houston Chronicle. But White shifted course in October, saying that joining the Secure Communities program instead would entail no special agreement with the Department of Homeland Security nor cost as much, the newspaper reported.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Houston Police Department joined Secure Communities and started using the same databases in mid-December. Perales said they have helped the city identify possible illegal immigrants plus individuals wanted in other states for other reasons. The Houston  Police Department joined the Secure Communities program and started  using its databases in mid-December. Perales said the data has helped the city  identify possible illegal immigrants plus individuals wanted in other  states for other reasons.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Vaughan said that because  the county and city have stepped up efforts to identify illegal  immigrants, she no longer views the city as much of a sanctuary.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Vaughan  said in a blog posted Friday, however, that from early March 2008 to  Sept. 30, 2009, the Secure Communities program as employed by Harris  County failed to identify nearly half the illegal immigrants snagged via  the county's 287(g) participation. \"Why the difference?\" her blog  states. \"Secure Communities can only flag those aliens whose  (fingerprints) or identifying information is already in immigration  databases.\" She writes that the results gap \"represents underachievement  on a large scale.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">None of this proves Adams'  claim that White \"offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The  Congressional Research Service did list Houston among localities with  sanctuary policies. Yet the only overt action on White's watch was the  decision, at the end of his six years in office, to join the Secure  Communities program -- a federal initiative intended to make it harder,  not easier, for illegal immigrants to remain in this country.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Whether  the White administration's approach helped make illegal immigrants feel  at ease in Houston is another question -- and not the one Adams raised.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We  rate her sanctuary statement as False.<br /><br /><br /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-12T19:04:05.381528", "ruling_date": "2010-03-14T05:43:21", "ruling_headline": "GOP Chair Cathie Adams says Bill White gave sanctuary to illegal immigrants as mayor of Houston", "ruling_headline_slug": "gop-chair-cathie-adams-says-bill-white-gave-sanctu", "ruling_link_text": "Personally, no, and Houston checks fingerprints against federal databases", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Austin   Police Department, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/03102010_austinpdpolicies.doc\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;General  Orders, Policies and Procedures, Interviews,  Stops and Arrests,&rdquo;</a> received March 10, 2010</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Congressional Research Service, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/08142006_crsreportimmlaw.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\"CRS  Report for Congress, Enforcing Immigration Law:  The Role of State and  Local Law Enforcement,\"</a> Updated Aug. 14, 2006</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Congressional   Research Service, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/01092008_crssanctuaryupdate.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;CRS  Report for Congress, &lsquo;Sanctuary Cities:&rsquo;
