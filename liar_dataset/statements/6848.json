(Although in these days of debate over climate change, the weather might be an issue of contention as well.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublican Michael Riley followed that tradition in a Sept. 30, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.mikerileyforcongress.com/media/news/2012/10/langevin-does-nothing-to-lower-the-price-of-gas-in-rhode-island\">news release</a> attacking incumbent U.S. Rep. James Langevin, a Democrat.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHeadlined &quot;Langevin Does Nothing to Lower the Price of Gas in Rhode Island,&quot; it blames Langevin for taking votes that led to higher gasoline prices, such as opposing &quot;completion of the Keystone Pipeline.&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/apr/19/american-energy-alliance/did-obama-policies-alaska-solyndra-and-keystone-co/\">For the record</a>, the pipeline, even if it had been approved as proposed in 2008, wasn&#39;t going to be completed until 2013, so it would have had no effect on current gasoline prices.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;When Congressman Langevin took office, gas was around $1.70 per gallon, and now it is near $4 per gallon,&quot; the Riley release says, contending elsewhere in the statement that Langevin is &quot;in part&quot; to blame.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, we checked Riley&#39;s numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the Rhode Island<a href=\"http://www.energy.ri.gov/news/energyprices/gasprices.php\"> Office of Energy Resources</a>, when Langevin took office &nbsp;on Jan. 8, 2001, the average price of a gallon of self-service gasoline was about $1.54. The Bureau of Labor Statistics pegs the January 2001 price at $1.53. That&#39;s not $1.70. Riley got that wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Sept. 30, 2012, when Riley issued his news release, the Rhode Island price was about $3.93, nearly $4, as the candidate said. He got that part right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen looking at claims such as this, we also ask ourselves whether it&#39;s accurate to ascribe blame.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRiley says in his news release that Langevin is partly to blame because of his energy votes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called and e-mailed the Riley campaign on Oct. 2 to find out how much blame he was talking about. We asked: &quot;How much responsibility does Langevin bear for the gas prices going from $1.70 when he took office to close to $4 now? 100%? 50%? 10%? 1%? 0.1%?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe never got a response.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, oil is a world commodity and gasoline prices are influenced by a wide variety of factors beyond the control of a single politician, and Langevin is one of 535 voting members of Congress.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe impact of the pipeline, to cite one of Riley&#39;s issues, is debatable. While the company behind the project has said it would reduce prices by 3.5 to 4 cents per gallon, <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-26/why-the-keystone-pipeline-wont-ease-pain-at-the-pump\">a March Business Week story</a> concluded that building the pipeline wouldn&#39;t bring down gasoline prices. <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-01/keystone-oil-pipeline-seen-raising-gas-prices-in-midwest-energy.html\">Another analysis</a> predicted that the pipeline could actually raise prices by 10 cents per gallon.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnalysts whom PolitiFact and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzEnKdBAb_o\">other news organizations</a> have consulted over the years <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/apr/29/national-republican-congressional-committee/national-republican-congressional-committee-says-g/\">have repeatedly said</a> that office holders, including the president, have little impact on gasoline prices at any particular time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMichael Riley blames Rep. James Langevin &quot;in part&quot; for skyrocketing gasoline prices, saying, &quot;When Congressman Langevin took office, gas was around $1.70 per gallon, and now it is near $4 per gallon.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLangevin was first elected to Congress nearly a dozen years ago, when the price was closer to $1.53, not $1.70.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Langevin&#39;s role in the global oil and gasoline market is so small to be almost inconsequential.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause Riley&#39;s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\"> Mostly False</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\">@politifactri</a>.
