Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa, and the underlying bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. Here&rsquo;s how the data stacks up.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull; One poll was done by CBS News and the <em>New York Times</em>. The <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/120711121?access_key=key-89a6eqy8ftxhwaw0k1k\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">survey</a>, conducted Jan. 11-15, 2013, found that 85 percent of those living in a household with an NRA member favored background checks for all potential gun buyers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull; The other <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/120711121?access_key=key-89a6eqy8ftxhwaw0k1k\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">survey</a>, by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, was taken Feb. 13-18, 2013. It found that &quot;people in NRA households overwhelmingly favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks: 74 percent favor this proposal while just 26 percent are opposed.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese results verify that rank-and-file NRA members and those who live with them favor universal background checks by margins of between 74 percent and 85 percent.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStill, there&rsquo;s a problem with Obama&rsquo;s phrasing. He said that a &quot;wide majority of NRA households ... supported this legislation.&quot; While the percentages supporting universal background checks in the latter two polls qualify as a &quot;wide majority&quot; in our book, each of these polls were taken before either of the two relevant pieces of legislation were filed in the Senate. Reid&rsquo;s underlying bill was submitted on March 21, while the Manchin-Toomey amendment was submitted on April 11.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo while the polls do demonstrate strong support for background checks -- a key element of both Senate measures -- it&rsquo;s a bit of a stretch to say that NRA members polled supported &quot;this legislation.&quot; The legislation in question hadn&rsquo;t even been introduced yet.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tObama said a &quot;wide majority of NRA households ... supported this legislation.&quot; Two fully independent polls showed that NRA members or households support expanded background checks, but the polls couldn&rsquo;t have asked about the &quot;legislation&quot; Obama referred to because those measures had not been introduced yet. We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-04-19T13:34:01.027745", "ruling_date": "2013-04-19T15:40:01", "ruling_headline": "Barack Obama says a \u201cwide majority of NRA households\" supported gun legislation", "ruling_headline_slug": "barack-obama-says-wide-majority-nra-households-sup", "ruling_link_text": "High support for policy, but polls asked before bills emerged", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWhite House, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/04/17/statement-president\">statement by the president in the Rose Garden</a>, April 17, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCBS News-<em>New York Times </em>poll, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/120711121?access_key=key-89a6eqy8ftxhwaw0k1k\">Gun Policy: Universal Background Checks and Armed Guards</a>,&quot; Jan. 11-15, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPew Research Center for the People and the Press, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2013/03/12/section-2-opinions-of-gun-owners-non-gun-owners/\">Why Own a Gun?
