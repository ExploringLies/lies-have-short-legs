He gets up and says that. And then he tells me that, oh, my language was a little bit rough.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Bush really say such a thing, and did the press ignore it? Trump&rsquo;s recounting of the facts is pretty selective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bush&rsquo;s comment about mooning</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s spokeswoman referred us to a a Feb. 6 article by Matt Viser in the <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/02/06/jeb-bush-fighting-for-survival-new-hampshire-symbol-gop-establishment-weakness/u0eRx0ydhhl29N3qrhmqnM/story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Boston Globe</u></a> a few days before the New Hampshire primary. The main point of the article was that Bush had to do well in New Hampshire -- or later this month in South Carolina -- or he would face pressure to end his campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;Sitting on his campaign bus &mdash; laptop, turkey jerky, and coffee all nearby &mdash; Jeb Bush was befuddled over his campaign&rsquo;s failure to capture more attention from the news media.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;I could drop my pants,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;Moon the whole crowd. Everybody would be aghast, except the press guys would never notice.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it was actually Bush who suggested -- in jest here -- to the <em>Boston Globe </em>reporter that he could even pull down his pants and moon people and he still would get no media attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s fair to say that Bush was exaggerating here to make a point about the lack of media coverage he was getting. And Bush made that point to a reporter from a major publication. And that reporter led with it in an article three days before the primary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s comments made it sound like Bush was threatening to moon people, and that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush&rsquo;s quote at the time was repeated on various blogs on the Internet, and The Drudge Report posted it on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mattdrudge/posts/10153827658411955\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Facebook. </u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that Bush &quot;said he would take his pants off and moon everybody ... Nobody reports that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush did talk about mooning people. The<em> Boston Globe</em> reported on Feb. 6 that Bush said, &quot;I could drop my pants. Moon the whole crowd. Everybody would be aghast, except the press guys would never notice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush&rsquo;s comment to the reporter was intended to show how he felt he was getting no campaign coverage. But Trump&rsquo;s statement is misleading, because Bush wasn&rsquo;t threatening to moon people, and his comment was indeed reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement has an element of truth but ignores critical context. So we rate it&nbsp;Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-14T00:19:46.121704", "ruling_date": "2016-02-14T00:57:29", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump wrongly says Jeb Bush said he would 'moon everybody' and 'nobody reports that'", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-says-jeb-bush-said-he-would-moon-ever", "ruling_link_text": "Bush said it hypothetically, the Boston Globe reported it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Boston Globe</em>, <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/02/06/jeb-bush-fighting-for-survival-new-hampshire-symbol-gop-establishment-weakness/u0eRx0ydhhl29N3qrhmqnM/story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;In New Hampshire, Jeb Bush is searching for a comeback,&quot;</u></a> Feb. 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mattdrudge/posts/10153827658411955\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Matt Drudge post</u></a>, Feb. 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-women-viciously-attacked-him-fir/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Donald Trump says &#39;he didn&#39;t say&#39; the things about women that Megyn Kelly asked him about in debate,&quot; </u></a>Aug. 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/19/donald-trump/trump-i-called-mccain-hero-four-times/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Trump: I called McCain a &#39;hero&#39; four times,&quot;</u></a> July 19, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Hill</em>, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/261381-trump-denies-mocking-disabled-reporter\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Trump denies mocking disabled reporter,&quot; </u></a>Nov. 26, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/13/the-cbs-republican-debate-transcript-annotated/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;CBS News Republican debate transcript annotated,&quot;</u></a> Feb. 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<div>Interview, Hope Hicks, Donald Trump campaign spokeswoman, Feb. 13, 2016</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Jeb Bush &quot;said he would take his pants off and moon everybody ...
