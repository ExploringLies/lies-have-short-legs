The measure flew through the Democrat-controlled House and Senate, going from introduction to passage in 11 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Gov. Chet Culver, a Democrat,&nbsp;vetoed the bill. Judge was Culver&rsquo;s lieutenant governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/pubs/hjweb/pdf/April%2025,%202008.pdf#page=267\">In his veto message</a>, Culver criticized the manner in which HF 2645 was passed, calling it &quot;a poorly written bill with sometimes-ambiguous language that raises troubling, unanswered questions and unresolved uncertainties for management, labor and taxpayers alike.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent weeks the extent to which Judge and other Culver administration officials collaborated with lawmakers and labor leaders to improve the bill has been hotly debated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an Iowa Public Television debate on May 26, Judge said she didn&rsquo;t &quot;believe there was a lot of back and forth on that particular piece of legislation&quot; and said she &quot;wished we could have worked more closely with labor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That led to a sharply worded retort from AFSCME Council 61, the state&rsquo;s main public employees&rsquo; union: &quot;Patty Judge is not telling the truth about labor&rsquo;s engagement with her administration during this process,&quot; AFSCME President Danny Homan said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then in a Des Moines Register/KCCI debate on Wednesday, Judge said she &quot;regretted&quot; how the bill was handled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I wish that we could go back and negotiate a good piece of legislation together,&quot; she said. &quot;But you know, we can&rsquo;t. We can&rsquo;t go backwards. We need to go&nbsp;forwards.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She followed that up by telling the Register that by the time the bill reached the governor, the opportunity for making constructive changes had passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I regret that it had to be vetoed. That decision did not come lightly. There was a lot of thought, a lot of conversation that went into it,&quot; Judge said. &quot;But when a bill is sent to the governor&rsquo;s office, there is no option for changing it. You sign it or you don&rsquo;t sign it. While there was lots of conversation, there was really no opportunity for any sort of amending.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did the governor&rsquo;s office&nbsp;have no opportunity to change the bill in a meaningful way after it was passed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/billTracking/billHistory?billName=HF%202645&amp;ga=82\">history of HF 2645</a>&nbsp;provides the answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/pubs/hjweb/pdf/March%2014,%202008.pdf#page=7\">introduced on March 14</a>. On March 19, it was debated on the House floor, where it faced dozens of proposed amendments before ultimately&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/pubs/hjweb/pdf/March%2019,%202008.pdf#page=67\">passing on a 52-47 vote</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It then went to the Senate, where it was considered on the floor on March 24. During a lengthy debate, more than 20 amendments were offered and rejected before the bill&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/pubs/sjweb/pdf/March%2024,%202008.pdf#page=16\">passed on a 27 to 23 vote</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that point, things slowed down. Rather than sending the bill directly to the governor&rsquo;s office, Senate records show&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/pubs/sjweb/pdf/March%2024,%202008.pdf#page=23\">Majority Leader Michael Gronstal, D-Council Bluffs, filed a motion to reconsider</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That parliamentary maneuver freezes legislation in place and allows lawmakers to reopen debate &mdash; including, potentially, amending or rewriting the bill and sending it to the other chamber for further discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The motion to reconsider held HF 2645 in place for more than a month &mdash;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/pubs/sjweb/pdf/April%2025,%202008.pdf#page=23\">until April 25, when Gronstal withdrew it</a>&nbsp;and began the process of sending the bill to Culver to be signed or vetoed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill reached Culver on May 5, and he vetoed it on May 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judge campaign manager Sam Roecker on Friday argued that the motion to reconsider didn&#39;t change the governor&#39;s office&#39;s ability to influence the bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;She has addressed the issue of the 2008 legislation and has said clearly she regrets the circumstances around which it was vetoed,&quot; Roecker said in a statement. &quot;However, regardless of a motion to reconsider, the governor&rsquo;s office does not have the power to introduce amendments to a bill before or after it&rsquo;s passed by the legislature.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judge said there&rsquo;s no option for changing or amending a bill after it&rsquo;s &quot;sent to the governor&rsquo;s office.&quot; That&rsquo;s true, but it overlooks the month-long period in which this particular collective bargaining legislation was held under a motion to reconsider after it was passed by lawmakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If legislators, the governor&rsquo;s office and other interested parties had found a new consensus on the bill&rsquo;s language sometime within that March 24 to April 25 window, the bill could have&nbsp;been reconsidered by the Senate, amended, returned to the House and ultimately passed in the altered form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this reason we rate Judge&rsquo;s assertions that there was &quot;no option for changing&quot; the bill&nbsp;and &quot;no opportunity for any sort of amending&quot; Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9824dadc-2713-4662-afe2-79c7f155e932\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9824dadc-2713-4662-afe2-79c7f155e932</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-03T17:30:28.088205", "ruling_date": "2016-06-03T20:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Patty Judge's collective bargaining claim rates Half True", "ruling_headline_slug": "patty-judges-collective-bargaining-claim-half-true", "ruling_link_text": "Consider the motion to reconsider", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Phone interview with Mike Marshall, Secretary of the Iowa Senate, June 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Sam Roecker, Judge campaign manager, June 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iowa Legislature Archive, <a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=82&amp;ba=HF2645\">House File 2645</a>, accessed June 2-3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iowa Legislature Archive, <a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/billTracking/billHistory?billName=HF%202645&amp;ga=82\">Bill History for HF 2645</a>, accessed June 2-3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iowa Legislature Archive, <a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/pubs/hjweb/pdf/April%2025,%202008.pdf#page=267\">Gov.
