Johnson said, that &lsquo;The Lego Movie&rsquo; &mdash; he said this &mdash; that &lsquo;The Lego Movie&rsquo; is an insidious, anti-business conspiracy. I didn&rsquo;t hear that. My grandkids don&rsquo;t even think that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">Did a sitting U.S. senator claim Hollywood is in cahoots with anti-business forces elsewhere to bring their insidious doctrine to the masses?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\"><strong>What Johnson said</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">&quot;The Lego Movie&quot; &mdash; which was released in February 2014 and brought in<a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lego.htm\"> almost $500 million worldwide</a> &mdash; follows the exploits of an extraordinarily average Lego construction worker named Emmet. The Washington Post<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/12/29/nerd-culture-gains-the-world-and-in-2014-recovers-some-of-its-lost-soul/\"> described</a> him as &quot;an unthinking worshipper at the consumerist temples that President Business has erected to distract his citizens from Business&rsquo; evil plan to freeze them into a state of perfection.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">In short, President Business &mdash; later revealed to be the sinister Lord Business &mdash; is trying to glue all the Legos together to keep everything in its proper place, and Emmet and his team of master builders want to maintain freedom and creativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">We eventually learn the plot stems from the imagination of a young boy playing with Legos belonging to his businessman father, who plans to, yes, glue them together to keep everything in its proper place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">So what did Johnson say? From March to May 2015 he commented on the movie in various forums including comments to the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram and<a href=\"http://dc.wispolitics.com/2015/05/johnson-explains-his-vote-for.html\"> Wispolitics.com</a>, a small group<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1992opAsgc&amp;feature=youtu.be\"> in Cedarburg</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ron-johnson-blog_us_55c27b6ae4b0923c12bb6bcd\">in a since-deleted</a> <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150709060250/http://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/in-the-news?ID=32943183-c443-48ac-84de-11ee725a3c94\">blog post</a> on his official Senate site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">In the various comments, Johnson made multiple references to leftist control of education and the media and repeatedly referred to &quot;The Lego Movie&quot; as anti-business, though not in those direct words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">As WisPolitics.com, phrased it in a May 28, 2015, post, Johnson &quot;lamented what he called a &lsquo;cultural attitude&rsquo; that &lsquo;government is good and business is bad,&rsquo; giving as an example the animated &lsquo;Lego&rsquo; movie, in which the villain is called &lsquo;Lord Business.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">&quot;That&#39;s done for a reason,&quot; Johnson told the site. &quot;They&#39;re starting that propaganda, and it&#39;s insidious.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">Johnson noted in his <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150709060250/http://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/in-the-news?ID=32943183-c443-48ac-84de-11ee725a3c94\">blog post</a> the same day that his comments were inspired by a Wall Street Journal<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/doug-haugh-businessmen-as-hollywood-bogeymen-1425566646\"> column</a> criticizing the anti-business tone of the movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">So Johnson clearly called the movie &lsquo;insidious&rsquo; and implied it was anti-business, but there&rsquo;s no conspiracy claim. (Merriam-Webster<a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conspiracy\"> defines</a> a conspiracy as &quot;a secret plan made by two or more people to do something that is harmful or illegal.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">When questioned on the &quot;conspiracy&quot; claim, Feingold&rsquo;s campaign provided a dozen links to stories on Johnson and &quot;The Lego Movie,&quot; but no evidence that Johnson had called it a conspiracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">A Feingold spokesman noted only that Johnson mentioned the movie to the Leader-Telegram two days after<a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/wgdb/the-two-sides-of-ron-johnsons-agenda/\"> describing to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a> how &quot;the radical left&quot; controls the university system, education system, news media, entertainment media and &quot;more and more of our courts.&quot; The coverage of that talk also did not include any more direct reference to a conspiracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">And the conspiracy claim was notably absent when Feingold&rsquo;s campaign hammered Johnson on &quot;The Lego Movie&quot; several weeks before the Democratic convention speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">The campaign issued a <a href=\"http://russfeingold.com/news/desk-lord-business/\">news release</a> May 14 and even<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZzumR2YOPo&amp;feature=youtu.be\"> sent</a> a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNk_b5KLCZs\"> press assistant</a> to Johnson&rsquo;s Milwaukee office dressed as Lord Business, asserting he and Johnson were friends. The character offered to endorse the senator if he supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement backed by the Obama administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\"><strong>Is the movie anti-business?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">As long as we&rsquo;re on the topic, are Johnson and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;v=rprB_VNm3L8\">other commentators</a> right to call the movie anti-business?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">However you summarize the plot, it is a feature-length piece of product placement, which seems a curious frame for anti-business propaganda. And while being &quot;anti-business&quot; is an opinion, it&rsquo;s worth noting the creators at least didn&rsquo;t intend it that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">Philip Lord, who co-wrote and co-directed the movie,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/12/lego-movie-writers-phil-lord-christopher-miller-interivew\"> described it</a> as an &quot;anti-totalitarian film for children. Something that was talking about the importance of freedom and innovation in keeping society honest.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">When asked to respond on Twitter to the anti-business claims last year, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philiplord/status/432256776705019905\">Lord said</a>: &quot;Art deserves many interpretations, even wrong ones.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\"><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">Feingold told a hall full of Democrats that his opponent called &quot;The Lego Movie&quot; an &quot;insidious, anti-business conspiracy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">Johnson used the word &quot;insidious&quot; to describe the movie on multiple occasions and repeatedly referred to it as anti-business, though not in so many words. But Feingold is wrong on the boldest and most significant part of the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">A conspiracy implies a specific fact &ndash; that some great hidden hand or collusion is at work to indoctrinate the masses. And it&rsquo;s something Johnson never said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">We rate Feingold&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p> <a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a8bce5ab-0679-4245-95b8-b779a490875f\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a8bce5ab-0679-4245-95b8-b779a490875f</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-23T13:45:37.404925", "ruling_date": "2016-06-24T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Did Ron Johnson call \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d an anti-business conspiracy?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-ron-johnson-call-lego-movie-anti-business-cons", "ruling_link_text": "Everything not awesome with this claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">YouTube, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/94WE1JO8Oj4?t=12024\">Democratic Party of Wisconsin State Convention</a> &ndash; Day 1, held June 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">Email exchange and phone conversations with Michael Tyler, spokesman for Russ Feingold campaign, June 7-13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">Email exchange with William Allison, spokesman for Ron Johnson campaign, June 7-9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">International Business Times, <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/fox-news-takes-aim-lego-movie-being-anti-capitalist-video-1435808\">Fox News Takes Aim at The Lego Movie for Being &lsquo;Anti-Capitalist,&rsquo; Feb. 10, 2014</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">Merriam-Webster Dictionary, definition of <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conspiracy\">conspiracy</a>, accessed June 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">WisPolitics.com, <a href=\"http://dc.wispolitics.com/2015/05/johnson-explains-his-vote-for.html\">Johnson explains his vote for Sensenbrenner&#39;s USA Freedom Act</a>, May 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">Wall Street Journal, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/doug-haugh-businessmen-as-hollywood-bogeymen-1425566646\">Businessmen as Hollywood Bogeymen</a>, Doug Haugh, March 5, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">Archived version of Ron Johnson blog post, Archive.org, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150709060250/http:/www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/in-the-news?ID=32943183-c443-48ac-84de-11ee725a3c94\">The totally unheard-of idea that movies like making businessmen the villain</a>, May 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">Interview with Patrick McIlheran, communications director for Ron Johnson (senate office), June 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">Huffington Post, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ron-johnson-blog_us_55c27b6ae4b0923c12bb6bcd\">GOP Senator Quietly Removes Blog Posts That May Have Violated Ethics Rules</a>, Aug. 5, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">BoxOfficeMojo.com, <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lego.htm\">The Lego Movie</a>, accessed June 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">The Washington Post, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/12/29/nerd-culture-gains-the-world-and-in-2014-recovers-some-of-its-lost-soul\">Nerd culture gains the world and in 2014, recovers some of its lost soul, Dec. 29, 2014</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">Roll Call,<a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/wgdb/the-two-sides-of-ron-johnsons-agenda/\"> The Two Sides of Ron Johnson&rsquo;s Agenda</a>,<a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/wgdb/the-two-sides-of-ron-johnsons-agenda/\"> March 12, 2015</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">The Guardian, The Lego Movie writer/directors: &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/12/lego-movie-writers-phil-lord-christopher-miller-interivew\">We Wanted to make an anti-totalitarian movie for kids&rsquo;, December 12, 2014</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">Twitter,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/philiplord/status/432256776705019905\"> Philip Lord</a>, Feb. 8, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1992opAsgc&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Ron Johnson on LEGO Movie</a> (Ron Johnson speech in Cedarburg in May 2015)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:4.5pt\">YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZzumR2YOPo&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Lord Business Visits Sen.
