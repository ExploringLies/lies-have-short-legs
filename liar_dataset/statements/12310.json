If this decision offends you as it does me, we need the President to know just how many Christians are offended. If you are offended, please copy and paste. Those who name Jesus Christ as their Lord God and Savior have too long allowed the world to take Him out of everything! Once again, never worried about offending Christians. I am sick and tired of our president that does everything to offend Christians but does everything he can to appease Muslims.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we spotted this on April 26, it was clear that <em>a lot</em>&nbsp;of people were bearing false witness, cutting and pasting the various forms of this post. One version reported that &quot;President Obama has decided that there will no longer be a &#39;National Day of Prayer,&#39; &quot; suggesting he had somehow managed to kill it forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheNationalDayofPrayerTaskForce/?fref=ts\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>National Day of Prayer</u></a> is scheduled for Thursday, May 5. A president can no more cancel it than the Grinch can cancel Christmas. It&#39;s written into law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More to the point, Obama has never shown an inclination for canceling it at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This warning has been <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/prayerday.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>sounded every year since 2009</u></a>, according to our friends at Snopes. The day was inaugurated in 1952, without setting a specific date. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan made it the first Thursday of May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama issued an official proclamation for the day in 2009 and has done so again in every subsequent year. <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/05/06/presidential-proclamation-national-day-prayer-2015\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Last year&#39;s proclamation</u></a> is on the White House website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Obama has not publicly participated in the celebration, he been involved in other prayer events.
