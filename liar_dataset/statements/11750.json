Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker,&quot; Obama said in his last annual State of the Union address Jan. 12, 2016. &quot;Let me tell you something: The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. Period. It&rsquo;s not even close. It&rsquo;s not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if that last statement on military spending was accurate, so we decided to check it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found Obama&rsquo;s claim is in the ballpark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One set of international military spending figures comes from the <a href=\"http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=496#\">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</a> (SIPRI), a think tank. The institute maintains an online database of military expenditures since 1988 for more than 170 countries. By their calculation, the United States spends more than the next <em>seven</em> countries combined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, the most recent year available, the United States led the world in military spending at $610 billion, marking 34 percent of the world total, <a href=\"http://books.sipri.org/files/FS/SIPRIFS1504.pdf\">SIPRI found</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. expenditures were nearly three times higher than China, the second-highest nation with an estimated $216 billion in military spending. Russia was in third place at $84.5 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But counting together military spending from the eight countries after the United States comes out to $646.4 billion, surpassing the United States&rsquo; $610. Omitting No. 9 on the list, Japan, the calculation comes out to about $601 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pgpf.org/sites/default/files/0053_defense-comparison-full.gif\">This graph</a>, put together by the fiscal policy-focused Peter G. Peterson Foundation, shows the United States&rsquo; spending in stark contrast to the next seven highest spenders:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7-UZRj5cLCuUtkBsfU-thETuYluAqGlXzngSWWNMoD7jFjbNvcQP-Yl_O2fGvl_Puf-3tI1FhoTF0sVAW1FMzkXRwK4r9NUVGzKLEfVWfENy8MqmSQ51vIVdei0kSbki8B1wGX_3\" style=\"border:none; height:382px; width:512px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another data set matches Obama&rsquo;s claim exactly. The United States does spend more than eight countries combined according to the <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/en/about%20us/press%20room/press%20releases/press%20releases/archive/2015-4fe9/february-0592/military-balance-2015-press-statement-40a1\">International Institute for Strategic Studies</a> (IISS), a London-based think tank that also tracks military spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States spent $581 billion on the military in 2014, according to IISS, while the eight next-highest spenders combined spent about $531.9 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calculating military expenditures for worldwide comparisons is inherently challenging, in part because there is no common definition of what constitutes military spending. Further, a country&rsquo;s expenditures does not necessarily correlate perfectly with its military capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Obama has a point that U.S. defense spending is significantly larger than that of every other nation, spending has gone down under his presidency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall spending on national security includes the Pentagon budget, as well as spending by other agencies, like the Energy Department&rsquo;s work on nuclear weapons. Spending increased in 2010 and 2011, but it has fallen every year for four years since then by a cumulative 15 percent. National security spending <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/hist03z1.xls\">made up 20.1 percent</a> of the federal budget in 2010, but in 2015 it was 15.9 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two main reasons for the spending drop. The first is the Obama administration&rsquo;s decision to start removing U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. The second has to do with sequestration, the automatic, across-the-board cuts originally designed to force bipartisan negotiations in Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama said, &quot;We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama&rsquo;s statement is accurate by one measure, while another measure says the United States spends more than the next seven countries combined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So depending on the data set you use, he&rsquo;s either right or close. So we rate his statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-01-13T00:17:40.488875", "ruling_date": "2016-01-13T00:29:32", "ruling_headline": "Obama: US spends more on military than next 8 nations combined", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-us-spends-more-military-next-8-nations-combi", "ruling_link_text": "By at least one measure", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>SIPRI, &quot;<a href=\"http://books.sipri.org/files/FS/SIPRIFS1504.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Trends in World Military Expenditure,</u></a>&quot; April 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IISS, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/en/about%20us/press%20room/press%20releases/press%20releases/archive/2015-4fe9/february-0592/military-balance-2015-press-statement-40a1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Military Balance 2015 Press Statement,</u></a>&quot; Feb. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter G.
