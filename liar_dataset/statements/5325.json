Bill Proctor, R-St. Augustine, stood firm behind <a href=\"http://staugustine.com/news/local-news/2012-01-05/proctor-merit-pay-track-despite-widespread-opposition-across-state#.TxWV8qU7WAh\">Senate Bill 736</a>. Proctor is the chair of a House education committee and chancellor at Flagler College.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level, and grade level isn&rsquo;t that difficult,&quot; Proctor said in comments to the <em><a href=\"http://staugustine.com/news/local-news/2012-01-05/proctor-merit-pay-track-despite-widespread-opposition-across-state#.T0U-3YcgfPa\">St. Augustine Record</a></em>. &quot;We&rsquo;ll see which teachers affect learning in their students.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were surprised by that statistic: Do half of Florida&rsquo;s high school graduates head off to college or work without reading at grade level?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida&rsquo;s seniors aren&rsquo;t tested for reading skills as they don their caps and gowns. But we found two compelling pieces of evidence that indicate Proctor is probably right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>FCAT and college entrance exams</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFlorida high school students take the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fcat.fldoe.org/mediapacket/2011/default.asp\">Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test</a>, or FCAT, in the 10th grade.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tProctor&rsquo;s office sent us to the most-recent 10th grade FCAT results. A &quot;3 or higher&quot; is considered reading at grade level. &nbsp;During the 2010-11 school year, only 39 percent of nearly 186,000 10th graders scored that well.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut 60 percent passed the test, which means it&rsquo;s possible to pass the test and read below grade level. Students are required to pass the 10th grade FCAT to graduate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStudents who fail have two opportunities per year to retake the test which would ultimately boost that 39 percent figure who scored at grade level. The retest data mixes students from different years, though, so we can&rsquo;t give a definitive number for how many more students passed the FCAT in a specific graduating class.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Yes, we graduate students that cannot read on 10th grade reading level,&quot; said Lindy Smith, an aide to Proctor, in an email. &quot;Of those students passing the 10th grade Reading FCAT, I do not know how many actually graduated - but as you know students must pass 10th grade Reading FCAT in order to graduate. We expect some growth in reading in grades 11 and 12 but do not test those results on FCAT.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe other piece of evidence came from the Florida Department of Education. Staff there pointed us to a December 2011 <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/290970-house-education-committee-packet-dec-7-2011.html\">report</a> on school assessment standards.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report stated that to be &quot;college ready&quot; students must graduate from high school, take certain courses and demonstrate basic literary skills. During the 2009-10 school year, 55 percent of the graduating seniors scored college ready for reading based on the ACT, SAT or CPT (The CPT, or College Placement Test, is primary used for the state&rsquo;s public community colleges.) That number, too, supports Proctor&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Experts on testing and education</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf the number of students reading at grade level is so abysmally low, why the repeated push for testing?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe posed that question to Matthew Ladner, a senior advisor of policy and research for the Foundation for Excellence in Education (chaired by former Gov. Jeb Bush). Ladner<br />\r\n\tcoauthored Report Card on American Education: Ranking State K-12 Performance, Progress and Reform for the <a href=\"http://www.alec.org/publications/report-card-on-american-education/\">American Legislative Exchange Council</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWithout the testing, Florida wouldn&rsquo;t have a measurement of its students&rsquo; performance, he said. And although no one is happy about that 39 percent figure of students reading at grade level in the 10th grade, Florida has made gains. Ladner pointed to the <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/states/\">National Assessment of Education Progress</a> which tests samples of students. Florida&rsquo;s fourth grade reading results were below the national average in 1998, but climbed enough by 2011 to be above the national average.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What you find is while there is still plenty of room for improvement in Florida, there has been a large amount of progress in the right direction,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also spoke with Robert Schaeffer, public education director of <a href=\"http://fairtest.org/\">FairTest</a>, a national organization which advocates for better forms of assessment. Schaeffer said that Proctor&rsquo;s claim sounded accurate, but he said that what constitutes &quot;grade level&quot; isn&rsquo;t objective criteria.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Grade level is a political construct,&quot; he said. &quot;If you gave the FCAT to many competent adults they would fail.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSchaeffer also said that the SAT and other college entrance exams are given to students who are already college bound, so that measure doesn&rsquo;t provide a full picture -- for example students who have dropped out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe State Board of Education approves the <a href=\"http://fcat.fldoe.org/fcat2/pdf/achlevel.pdf\">achievement level descriptions</a> for FCAT 2.0.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProctor said &quot;Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level.&quot; The results for 10th grade reading FCAT show only 39 percent at grade level. Some additional students met that grade level mark through retests or by a sufficient score on the SAT or ACT, which would boost that 39 percent figure. Another way to measure Proctor&rsquo;s claim is by looking at the percentage who were deemed college ready for reading based on college entrance exams, and that figure was 55 percent for 2009-10. By both measurements, the figure is close to 50 percent. We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-02-08T16:26:02.099480", "ruling_date": "2012-02-23T08:17:26", "ruling_headline": "Half of Florida's high school grads can't read at grade level, says Bill Proctor", "ruling_headline_slug": "rep-proctor-says-half-high-school-grads-cant-read-", "ruling_link_text": "All that testing leads to dismal conclusions", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tSt. Augustine Record, <a href=\"http://staugustine.com/news/local-news/2012-01-05/proctor-merit-pay-track-despite-widespread-opposition-across-state#.TxWV8qU7WAh\">&quot;Proctor: Merit pay on track,&quot;</a> Jan. 6, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/promises/scott-o-meter/promise/619/pay-teachers-based-on-performance-merit-pay/\">&quot;New teachers will be paid based on student performance,&quot;</a> March 24, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida Senate, <a href=\"http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/0736\">Bill 736</a>, Effective July 1, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida Department of Education, <a href=\"http://fcat.fldoe.org/mediapacket/2011/default.asp\">2011 Florida statewide assessment scores</a>, Accessed Jan. 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida House of Representatives, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/290970-house-education-committee-packet-dec-7-2011.html\">Education committee meeting packet</a>, Dec. 7, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida Department of Education, <a href=\"http://fcat.fldoe.org/pdf/fcatpass.pdf\">Graduation requirements for Florida&rsquo;s statewide assessments</a>, Jan. 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida Department of Education, <a href=\"http://fcat.fldoe.org/fcat2/pdf/achlevel.pdf\">FCAT 2.0 and Florida EOC assessments achievement levels</a>, Updated February 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Assessment of Educational Progress, <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/states/\">State profiles-Florida</a>, Accessed Jan. 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmerican Legislative Exchange Council, <a href=\"http://www.alec.org/publications/report-card-on-american-education/\">Website</a>, Accessed Jan. 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://fairtest.org/\">FairTest</a> website, Accessed Feb. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://excelined.org/\">Foundation for Excellence in Education website</a>, Accessed Feb. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Jamie Champion-Mongiovi, spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Education, Jan. 17-Feb. 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Lindy Smith, administrative aide to Rep.
