That calculation was made by downloading a zipped file of the code, unzipping it and running it through Microsoft Word&rsquo;s word count feature, according to a footnote in the report. A 2012 version of the report puts the number of words in the code at &quot;about 4 million.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also reached out to CCH, the Riverwoods, Ill.-based publisher of the two-volume 2013 Winter version of the tax code and was told the best estimate of word length was 4 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was two years ago, but we think it&rsquo;s a safe bet that the length of the tax code has only increased since then, not decreased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How long is the Bible?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dennis Olson, the Charles T. Haley professor of Old Testament Theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary, told PolitiFact New Jersey that a fair approximation of the Bible&rsquo;s length is 800,000 words for the Old and New testaments combined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The King James Version would be 823,156 while the more recent New Revised Standard Version would be 774,746 words,&quot; Olson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hellen Mardaga, an assistant professor of New Testament at Catholic University in Washington, agreed that estimates that put the Bible at 800,000 words were credible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Put it all together and the tax code is roughly five times as long as the Bible. So Cruz is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz said, &quot;There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s generally accepted that the tax code is about 4 million words long and that the Bible is about 800,000. That&rsquo;s five times as long. So Cruz&rsquo;s claim is True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-10T23:49:25.340803", "ruling_date": "2015-11-10T23:58:18", "ruling_headline": "Ted Cruz says U.S. tax code has more words than the Bible", "ruling_headline_slug": "ted-cruz-says-us-tax-code-has-more-words-bible", "ruling_link_text": "The Good (and comparatively brief) Book", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Ted Cruz, comments at the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Nov. 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact New Jersey, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2013/may/02/leonard-lance/leonard-lance-claims-federal-tax-code-contains-4-m/\">Leonard Lance claims federal tax code contains 4 million words, is 7 times as long as Bible</a>,&quot; May 2, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 43, "current_job": "Senator", "false_count": 38, "first_name": "Ted", "half_true_count": 20, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 1475, "last_name": "Cruz", "mostly_true_count": 22, "name_slug": "ted-cruz", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/CRUZPFTNEW.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1475/", "total_count": 141, "true_count": 7, "website": "http://www.tedcruz.org/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Wis.", "statement_date": "2015-11-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
