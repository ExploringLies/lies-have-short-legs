Mark Warner insisted that GOP challenger Ed Gillespie supports laws that would provide embryos with rights the moment of conception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He supports a personhood amendment that is so far out of the mainstream that it would ban certain common forms of contraception,&quot; Warner, a Democrat, said during the July 26 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKSafpwiEXQ\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>debate</u></a>. He cast Gillespie as sympathetic towards several other socially conservative policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillespie protested. &quot;This is an area where you&rsquo;re making up my views,&quot; he said. &quot;Please provide the documentation for my support of any of those things.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warner persisted, directly asking Gillespie if he ever supported a personhood amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No,&quot; Gillespie said. &quot;Provide documentation of that. When did I support a personhood amendment?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ll give you the documentation,&quot; Warner replied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly after the debate, his campaign put out an email saying that Gillespie was chairman of the Republican National Committee in 2004 when the party adopted a national <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/papers_pdf/25850.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>platform</u></a> calling for a personhood amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The platform said, &quot;As a country, we must keep our pledge to the first guarantee of the Declaration of Independence. That is why we say the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution, and we endorse legislation to make it clear that the Fourteenth Amendment&rsquo;s protections apply to unborn children.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As our colleagues at PolitiFact national have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/25/barack-obama/romney-abortion-rape-incest/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>noted</u></a>, the human life amendment would assert that legal personhood begins at conception and with it, constitutional protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personhood legislation has drawn enormous debate in Virginia and across the nation. Supporters say the laws provide a legal remedy if an unborn child is killed by neglect or a third party. Opponents say the measures are a ruse to challenge rights to abortion and contraceptives that could prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillespie &quot;had an understanding of the platform, and what was in it,&quot; said David Turner, Warner&rsquo;s campaign spokesman. &quot;He was chair of the RNC and on the platform committee that crafted the language.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillespie was RNC chairman from 2003 to 2005. We should note that GOP has adopted platforms calling for a human life amendment at each of its national conventions since 1984, according to <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25848\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>records</u></a> kept by the American Presidency Project at the University of California at Santa Barbara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this is in the past, however. Warner&rsquo;s statement was in the present tense. He said Gillespie &quot;supports a personhood amendment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turner shifted to 2014 by pointing to the National Right to Life&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.nrlvictoryfund.org/press/release053014/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>endorsement</u></a> of Gillespie in May. The anti-abortion group said Gillespie, when he was RNC chairman, &quot;worked closely with pro-life leaders to ensure the platform remained resolute in seeking to restore legal protection to unborn children threatened by abortion&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We repeatedly asked officials at National Right to Life group to specify actions Gillespie took to ensure the GOP stood hard on a personhood amendment but didn&rsquo;t receive a direct answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turner noted that Gillespie tweeted news of his Right to Life endorsement. &quot;By touting a release that specifically referenced his work on a platform that had language described as calling for a personhood amendment, he has effectively endorsed that work during this campaign,&quot; Turner emailed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillespie, on his <a href=\"http://edforsenate.com/about/issues/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>website</u></a>, says he&rsquo;s &quot;pro-life,&quot; and opposes taxpayer funding of abortion. He doesn&rsquo;t mention a personhood amendment. Paul Logan, Gillespie&rsquo;s campaign spokesman, emailed us last week that &quot;Ed doesn&rsquo;t support a personhood amendment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Our ruling</strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warner says Gillespie &quot;supports a personhood amendment.&quot; Gillespie says he doesn&rsquo;t and challenged the senator to prove his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillespie was certainly national GOP chairman in 2004 when the party adopted a platform supporting a human life amendment. But we haven&rsquo;t seen any clear personal expression from his supporting such a law either then or now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Warner has failed to prove his claim. We rate Warner&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-04T11:22:04.939334", "ruling_date": "2014-08-04T13:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Warner says Gillespie supports a personhood amendment", "ruling_headline_slug": "warner-says-gillespie-supports-personhood-amendmen", "ruling_link_text": "Proof falls short", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Virginia Bar Association U.S. Senate <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKSafpwiEXQ\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>debate</u></a>, July 26, 2014.
