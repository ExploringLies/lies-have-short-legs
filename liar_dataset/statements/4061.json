A lot of union members vote Republican. I think a third -- what is it, 40 percent, even of union members voted Republican even in 2008?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;And, in fact,&quot; he continued, &quot; ... it&#39;s a real question how much the union leadership speaks for the members. And I do think it&#39;s very important for the Republican candidate in 2012 to be able to win over what we used to call Reagan Democrats, many of whom are (or) who have been union members.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo check Kristol, we decided to look at exit poll data -- the surveys taken every two years of voters leaving polling places. These surveys, which are designed to capture a snapshot of the electorate on Election Day, classify voters by a range of demographic questions, some of which involve union membership.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe looked at the exit poll numbers for 2008 and found that 39 percent of voters from union households voted for Republican presidential nominee John McCain, compared to 59 percent for Democrat Barack Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Kristol&rsquo;s memory was essentially correct. Still, we&rsquo;ll provide a couple minor caveats.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, there are slight differences between how voters from union households voted (that is, the numbers we cited above) and how union members themselves voted (which is specifically how Kristol phrased his comment). Union <em>members</em> voted 60 percent for Obama and 37 percent for McCain -- two points less for McCain than voters who lived in union <em>households</em>. (Voters from union households accounted for 21 percent of the electorate in 2008, while union members accounted for 12 percent.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecond, judging by the context, we think Kristol meant voting patterns in the 2008 presidential race, but it&rsquo;s worth noting that the same exit polls painted a different picture of union voter behavior in House elections.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2008, voters from union households split their vote for House candidates this way: 34 percent for Republican candidates and 64 percent for Democratic candidates. The numbers were similar for actual union members -- 34 percent backed Republican candidates and 65 percent backed Democratic candidates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also wondered about the long-term trendline, since Kristol&rsquo;s implication was that Republicans did pretty well in 2008 in securing union votes. So we looked at past levels of union support for GOP candidates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor presidential elections, we compared the GOP candidate&rsquo;s vote share from union members to the GOP candidate&rsquo;s vote share from all voters. (In every case, the Republican did better among all voters than among union voters.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found that McCain did better than almost all of his Republican predecessors in winning votes from union households. McCain won 46 percent of the vote nationally, so his union backing was only 7 points behind his overall support.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince 1952, only one other Republican candidate did as well among union voters -- Ronald Reagan in 1980, who also had a gap of just 7 points between overall support and union support. But Reagan wasn&rsquo;t able to repeat his magic in 1984 -- his union vote trailed his national vote by 13 points. And that pattern continued until McCain in 2008, with the gap bouncing between 11 and 13 points from 1984 to 2004.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo there&rsquo;s some support for the notion that Republicans are doing pretty well among union voters these days.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKristol&rsquo;s recollection on <em>Fox News Sunday</em> was very close to reality. We&rsquo;re only lowering him a notch due to a lack of clarity about whether he meant union members as opposed to union households, and about which 2008 election he meant -- presidential or House. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-06T12:41:12.554468", "ruling_date": "2011-07-07T10:16:16", "ruling_headline": "Bill Kristol says 40 percent of union members voted for John McCain in 2008", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-kristol-says-40-percent-republicans-voted-joh", "ruling_link_text": "Historically speaking, McCain did well in union households", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBill Kristol, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/transcript/sen-cornyn-debt-talks-sens-graham-lieberman-talk-afghanistan-gary-sinise-helping-wounded-?page=5\">comments</a> on Fox News Sunday, July 3, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t2008 exit polls, via <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#val=USP00p3\">CNN.com</a>, accessed July 6, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmerican Enterprise Institute, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/215169-voting-data-presidential-1952-to-2008.html\">Voting by Key Groups in Presidential Elections, 1952-2008</a>,&quot; Nov. 6, 2008<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmerican Enterprise Institute, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/215171-voting-data-house-1980-2010.html\">Voting by Key Groups in House Elections 1952-2010</a>,&quot; November 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNate Silver, &quot;The Effects of Union Membership on Democratic Voting&quot; (<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/26/the-effects-of-union-membership-on-democratic-voting/\">New York Times blog post)</a>, Feb. 26, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.usconstitution.net/elections.html\">Presidential election results</a>, accessed July 6, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Karlyn Bowman, polling analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, July 5, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Amy Walter, political director of ABC News, July 6, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Michael Podhorzer, political director for the AFL-CIO, July 6, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Editor, the Weekly Standard", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Bill ", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Washington, D.C.", "id": 1093, "last_name": "Kristol", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "bill-kristol", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Kristol_mug2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1093/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.weeklystandard.com/author/william-kristol"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tForty percent of union members voted Republican in 2008.</p>", "statement_context": "an interview on \"Fox News Sunday\"", "statement_date": "2011-07-03", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 192, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/192/", "subject": "Labor", "subject_slug": "labor", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 103, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/103/", "subject": "Workers", "subject_slug": "workers", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
