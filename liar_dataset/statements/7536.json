Drawing on the IMF research, Bloomberg said the &quot;taxpayer subsidy&quot; for the 10 largest U.S. banks amounts to $83 billion a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked further and found questions about Bloomberg&#39;s methodology figuring the size of what it referred to as a subsidy. Determining the size was one of the questions that Brown and Vitter put to the GAO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While its size may be in question, however, the existence of the implicit &quot;too big to fail&quot; guarantee is widely accepted as established fact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Unsecured depositors and creditors offer their funds at a lower cost to TBTF banks than to mid-sized and regional banks that face the risk of failure,&quot; Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said in Washington in January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What remains unclear from Brown&#39;s citations is whether lower borrowing costs for big banks result in any present-day costs for taxpayers. But PolitiFact Ohio did find an economist who contends that by granting the too-big-to-fail guarantees, the government is &quot;giving something away of value&quot; that should be accounted for as lost revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Private entities such as insurance companies and hedge funds would charge a fair value for such options,&quot; said James Thomson, a vice president and financial economist in the research department at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. &quot;But not doing so, the government is forgoing revenues that could be used for other purposes. So yes, the implicit subsidy (or any subsidy) is equivalent to a tax expenditure - like investment tax credits, fair housing credits, and so on.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economists don&#39;t agree on the size of the guarantee, Thomson said, though researchers including <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2018474\">economists at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</a>. claim to have measured it, in addition to the IMF, Dallas Fed and Bloomberg among others..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most telling testimony about &quot;Too Big to Fail&quot; might be that of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5Q5-jfkbxk&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke</a> to the Senate Banking Committee in February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, pressed Bernanke about the &quot;free insurance policy&quot; for the biggest banks, using Bloomberg&#39;s figure of $83 billion. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5Q5-jfkbxk&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Video of the exchange</a> is posted online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bernanke readily conceded existence of the implicit guarantee, though he maintained it is built on false expectation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The subsidy is coming because of market expectations that the government would bail out these firms if they failed,&quot; he said. &quot;Those expectations are incorrect.... That&#39;s the expectation of markets, that doesn&#39;t mean that we have to do it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I understand that we&rsquo;re all trying to get to the end of &#39;too big to fail,&#39;&quot; Warren responded. But until it is ended, she said, &quot;it is working like an insurance policy. Ordinary folks pay for homeowners insurance. Ordinary folks pay for car insurance. And these big financial institutions are getting cheaper borrowing to the tune of $83 billion in a single year simply because people believe that the government would step in and bail them out. And I&rsquo;m just saying, if they are getting it, why shouldn&rsquo;t they pay for it?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think we should get rid of it,&quot; Bernanke said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we note the <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-112shrg64832/pdf/CHRG-112shrg64832.pdf\">final report of the Congressional Oversight Panel on the Troubled Asset Relief Program </a>(TARP), which said that the six biggest U.S. banks received a total of $1.27 trillion in government support during the financial crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report notes the moral hazard and &quot;distortion of the financial marketplace through [TARP&#39;s] implicit guarantee of &#39;too big to fail&#39; banks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report says: &quot;It is not surprising that markets have assumed that &lsquo;too big to fail&rsquo; banks are safer than their &lsquo;small enough to fail&rsquo; counterparts. Credit rating agencies continue to adjust the credit ratings of very large banks to reflect their implicit government guarantee. Smaller banks receive no such adjustment, and as a result, they pay more to borrow relative to very large banks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exact value of the &quot;too big to fail&quot; guarantee, or risk premium, or free insurance, remains in question -- and it is a question Brown and Vitter put to the Government Accountability Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the biggest banks that received bailouts in 2009 clearly do have a cost advantage in borrowing because of the implicit guarantee. And that advantage is not shared by smaller, community banks. That makes Brown&rsquo;s statement partially accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, at PolitiFact, words matter. Even if there is an implicit guarantee, it&rsquo;s a stretch to call it a taxpayer-funded advantage the banks receive &quot;today,&quot; because no money has actually been spent and no dollars change hands. And no money would be spent unless the banks fail. Even then, as Bernanke says, &quot;that doesn&#39;t mean that we have to&quot; bail them out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It might seem like a fine line, but there is a difference between a taxpayer-backed advantage and a taxpayer-funded subsidy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Brown&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-19T17:44:32.481273", "ruling_date": "2013-03-20T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": " Sen.
