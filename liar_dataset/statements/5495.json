In that interview, Axelrod tried to shift the focus from that night&rsquo;s GOP primary fight in Ohio -- in which Mitt Romney edged out Rick Santorum statewide -- to the president&rsquo;s reelection bid.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Tonight in Ohio, more people came out to vote for Barack Obama in an unopposed race than voted for Romney and Santorum combined,&quot; Axelrod told Williams.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA reader asked us to check this claim, so we did.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe looked at the <a href=\"http://vote.sos.state.oh.us/pls/enrpublic/f?p=130:18:0:PRDSW:NO::P18_SELECTED:1\">Ohio Secretary of State&rsquo;s election results page</a> and found the following statewide totals as of the morning after the primary, at which point 100 percent of precincts had been counted. Here are the totals:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Obama</strong>: 547,588 votes (100 percent of the Democratic primary vote)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Romney</strong>: 456,205 votes (37.95 percent of the Republican primary vote)<br />\r\n\t<strong>Santorum</strong>: 445,697 votes (37.07 percent of the Republican primary vote)<br />\r\n\t<strong>Total of Romney and Santorum</strong>: 901,902 votes</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tClearly, Obama didn&rsquo;t outpoll the combination of Romney and Santorum. He did outpoll them each individually, so Axelrod would have been correct if he&rsquo;d said that Obama won more votes than &quot;either Romney or Santorum.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe do have an educated guess about where Axelrod may have gotten the idea, though.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt 8:17 p.m., BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith, a prominent national political journalist, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BuzzFeedBen/status/177201221906608128\">tweeted</a>, &quot;Huh: So far more votes for Obama in OH tonight than for all Republicans (who have actual campaigns) combined.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, 14 minutes later, Smith <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BuzzFeedBen/status/177204849484632064\">walked back that comment</a>: &quot;Ah: The early pile of votes for Obama seems to be because Cuyahoga among the first reporting.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSmith was referring to Cuyahoga County, which is home to Cleveland. Not only is Cuyahoga County a populous jurisdiction that votes heavily Democratic, but voters in a portion of it were especially likely to vote that day because of another race on the ballot -- the hotly contested face-off, forced by redistricting, between incumbent Democratic House members Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAll told, 39 percent of the new congressional district is in Cuyahoga. Having a large number of ballots counted early in the evening from Cuyahoga would boost Obama&#39;s turnout numbers compared to the Republican candidates.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAxelrod&rsquo;s interview was at 10:30 p.m., which was well after Smith&rsquo;s correction tweet.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAxelrod&rsquo;s claim turned out to be off by a wide margin by the time all votes were counted and was almost certainly wrong at the time he said it. We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>: <em>Shortly after we posted the item, Axelrod <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/davidaxelrod/status/177514246098264064\">tweeted</a> to take responsibility for his error: &quot;Guilty as charged!
