Saxby Chambliss&rsquo; seat is more crowded than the mall on Christmas Eve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus far, the race includes three congressmen, a former secretary of state, a former state senator, a former U.S. senator&rsquo;s daughter and a former governor&rsquo;s cousin. And that&rsquo;s just the candidates who&rsquo;ve grabbed the most headlines. For lesser-known candidates, distinguishing themselves has been tough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One candidate, Dr. Branko Radulovacki, a Democrat and Atlanta psychiatrist, is doing his best to emerge from the fray. <a href=\"http://drradforsenate.com/\"><u>Dr. Rad</u></a> -- as he prefers to be called -- has been appearing everywhere, commenting on the issues in online videos, town hall meetings and through campaign emails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One such email, titled &quot;Walking the Talk,&quot; highlights Dr. Rad&rsquo;s actions. The email includes several &quot;only&quot; statements, touting the Atlanta doctor as being the only candidate to participate in the 50th anniversary March on Washington, the &quot;Si se puede&quot; immigration reform march in Atlanta and to march in Atlanta&rsquo;s Pride parade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it was his &quot;only&quot; statements about two controversial political topics -- Syria and the Affordable Care Act -- that intrigued us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the key statements from Dr. Rad&rsquo;s campaign email, emphasis his:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m the <u>only</u> one who spoke out against bombing Syria. And the <u>only</u> one who took on Governor Deal and Insurance Commissioner Hudgens over their efforts to <u>&lsquo;obstruct&rsquo; the Affordable Care Act in Georgia</u>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more than a dozen announced candidates in that U.S. Senate race, we were curious whether Dr. Rad&rsquo;s statements were correct. Did he actually hold the &quot;only&quot; title on these two issues? We decided to investigate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few months ago, international relations were strained as President Barack Obama considered taking military action against Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons. Dr. Rad released a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/dr-rad-for-senate/democratic-senate-candidate-dr-rad-statement-on-syria/607692929254086\"><u>statement </u></a>opposing the strikes. And at the time, many of Georgia&rsquo;s leading Republicans, including those running for Senate, also denounced Obama&rsquo;s plans, saying the president failed to make his case for attacking the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Georgia&rsquo;s research found that Peach State congressmen and Senate candidates <a href=\"http://dacula.patch.com/groups/politics-and-elections/p/broun-military-intervention-in-syria-not-within-our-national-interests\"><u>Paul Broun</u></a> and <a href=\"http://gingrey.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=347941\"><u>Phil Gingrey</u></a> spoke out against the proposed attacks, and U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston was <a href=\"http://onlineathens.com/local-news/2013-09-02/us-rep-jack-kingston-leaning-no-syria-strike\"><u>leaning no</u></a>. And former Secretary of State Karen Handel even made a <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/georgia-senate-candidate-invokes-syria-attack-in-radio-ad/article/2535663\"><u>radio ad</u></a> out of her opposition, and used it as an attack ad against leading Democratic challenger Michelle Nunn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Democratic side, former state Sen. Steen Miles also <a href=\"http://stonemountain.patch.com/groups/politics-and-elections/p/us-senate-candidate-steen-miles-speaks-out-on-syria\"><u>publicly opposed</u></a> strikes on Syria. From our research of major announced candidates, only Nunn <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/political-insider/2013/sep/06/michelle-nunn-backs-syria-strike/\"><u>supported</u></a> Obama&rsquo;s plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was less political chatter surrounding Dr. Rad&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act claim. Georgia &nbsp;Gov. Nathan <a href=\"http://gov.georgia.gov/press-releases/2012-06-28/deal-olens-disappointed-ruling-obamacare\"><u>Deal</u></a> and Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens were early opponents of Obama&rsquo;s health care plan. Hudgens even bragged during the summer about being an &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/jay-bookman/2013/aug/29/ga-insurance-chief-brags-about-sabotage-obamacare/\"><u>obstructionist</u></a>&quot; to the law. Last week, when asked about the health care plan rollout, Hudgens said he hopes the plan &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/georgia-insurance-commissioner-insurance-commissio/nbbQ7/\"><u>implodes</u></a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia chose <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/deal-rejects-expansion-of-medicaid/nRMfK/\"><u>not to expand</u></a> Medicaid for low-income residents, and not to offer a state-based health care marketplace for its residents seeking health insurance coverage under the new law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Rad released a <a href=\"http://heretohelpga.com/\"><u>statement and video</u></a> about the leaders&rsquo; &quot;obstructionism,&quot; saying it was hurting the state. &quot;We call on Gov. Deal and Insurance Commissioner Hudgens to STEP UP and lead, or STEP ASIDE,&quot; Rad&rsquo;s statement and petition said. Last week, he <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/dr-rad-for-senate/us-senate-candidate-dr-rad-congratulates-insurance-commissioner-ralph-hudgens/631307913559254\"><u>applauded</u></a> Hudgens for putting some helpful information about the law and insurance marketplaces on the insurance commissioner&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.oci.ga.gov/\"><u>website</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with Dr. Rad&rsquo;s statements, we found<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/political-insider/2013/jul/22/michelle-nunn-declares-herself-us-senate-candidate/\"><u> comments</u></a> from Nunn about Deal&rsquo;s rejection of the Medicaid expansion and the impact on war veterans. (Nunn received a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2013/aug/06/michelle-nunn/senate-candidate-pushes-war-vets-medicaid-plan/\"><u>True</u></a> rating from PolitiFact Georgia for her statements.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When contacted by PolitiFact Georgia, Dr. Rad reviewed the statements and admitted that his campaign email was incorrect. The doctor said that a campaign staffer in charge of composing the email unintentionally misrepresented one of Dr. Rad&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DrRadforSenate\"><u>Facebook</u></a> posts. That post, an open letter dated Oct. 11, detailed the ways the physician was different from the other Senate candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The buck stops with me,&quot; Dr. Rad told us. &quot;It was a mistake and I take full responsibility for that mistake. I will set the record straight.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Rad promised to send out another campaign statement correcting the errors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So where does this leave us?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Atlanta physician released a campaign email that said he was the only Senate candidate to speak out against bombing Syria, and to challenge Georgia&rsquo;s governor and insurance commissioner about obstructing the federal health care law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Rad is incorrect on the first point: Several Republican candidates, including current congressmen, spoke against proposed attacks on Syria. And another candidate produced a radio ad about her opposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the health care front, one other Democratic Senate candidate spoke out against the state&rsquo;s decision not to expand Medicaid to poor residents, which was a large part of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Rad admitted that the campaign email was incorrect and promised to correct the error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corrections are always a good thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But on the initial claim, the doctor gets a False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-04T15:19:16.903895", "ruling_date": "2013-11-05T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Senate candidate\u2019s use of \u2018only\u2019 hits a snag", "ruling_headline_slug": "senate-candidates-use-only-hits-snag", "ruling_link_text": "Others beat him to the punch.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Campaign email, &quot;Walking the Talk,&quot; Dr. Rad, Oct. 14, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview, Dr. Rad, Oct. 31, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marietta Daily Journal, Around Town column, &quot;<a href=\"http://mdjonline.com/view/full_story/23572003/article-Around-Town--Bombing-Syria--Isakson-off-Hot-Seat--Nunn-on?instance=special%20_coverage_right_column\"><u>Bombing Syria: Isakson off hot seat, Nunn on</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 9, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democratic Senate candidate Dr. Rad <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/dr-rad-for-senate/democratic-senate-candidate-dr-rad-statement-on-syria/607692929254086\"><u>statement on Syria</u></a>, Sept. 9, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Rad campaign video, &quot;<a href=\"http://heretohelpga.com/\"><u>Sign the petition!</u></a> Tell Georgia to step up or step aside&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Examiner, &quot;<a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/georgia-senate-candidate-invokes-syria-attack-in-radio-ad/article/2535663\"><u>Georgia Senate candidate invokes Syria attack in radio ad</u></a>,&quot; Rebecca Berg, Sept. 12, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Channel 2 Action News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/georgia-insurance-commissioner-insurance-commissio/nbbQ7/\"><u>Georgia insurance commissioner: I hope Obamacare implodes</u></a>,&quot; Oct. 28, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stone Mountain-Lithonia Patch, &quot;<a href=\"http://stonemountain.patch.com/groups/politics-and-elections/p/us-senate-candidate-steen-miles-speaks-out-on-syria\"><u>U.S. Senate candidate Steen Miles speaks out on Syria</u></a>,&quot; Kevin Madigan, Sept. 8, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Rep.
