This is a theme that came into sharp focus during the immigration debate when House Republicans said they wouldn&rsquo;t move forward because they didn&rsquo;t trust the president to enforce the law. The botched launch of the Obamacare website did the president no favors. Now, Republicans are pouring concerns over Ebola and the Secret Service into the same mold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pundits lobbed their opposing views at each other on <em><a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday-chris-wallace/2014/10/05/us-doing-everything-it-can-contain-ebola-secret-service-attempting-overcome-its-scandals\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Fox News Sunday</u></a></em>. Brit Hume said the level of people saying the government is incompetent is higher than ever. Juan Williams shot back that the public always thinks the government is incompetent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>George Will entered the fray to note that the country has most to fear from &quot;excessive faith in government.&quot; Will skewered Republicans for engaging in nation building overseas and Democrats for their efforts to cure social ills at home. Then Will made an interesting historical observation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The last time there was a sustained surge of confidence in government&#39;s competence was under (President) Ronald Reagan,&quot; Will said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will is correct that public trust in government rose and then held steady under Reagan. But he errs in ignoring Bill Clinton&rsquo;s two terms in office, when the public&rsquo;s trust in government also rose sharply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the following chart, the Pew Research Center averaged the results of a number of surveys since 1958 that probed the public&rsquo;s trust in government. (The political scientists we reached said the words &quot;confidence&quot; and &quot;trust&quot; are largely synonymous in this context.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Trust trend.gif\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/YBCt-zwAiEi5JY93yrVcnakuCUQDiMg8nzJohnr4N6pgczx6jqwolamcy_kjLeA0-f5zcWsvimWSpa6M8ftTzNW7u_pZfN0xk3ltjOGOf7UnaG6ybd7EBNtp5lV9bgY-nw\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:419px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>Source: Pew Research Center, </em><a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2013/10/18/trust-in-government-interactive/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Public trust in government: 1958-2013</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trust in government fluctuated during both the Reagan and Clinton presidencies, but under Reagan, trust rose by 11 percentage points -- from 33 percent to 44 percent.
