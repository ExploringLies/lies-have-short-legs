John Linder (R-Ga.) and 9th Congressional District candidate  Tom Graves seemed to be on the same page regarding their support for the  FairTax, particularly since they spoke in favor of the idea at an event  in Missouri in June 2009.<br /><br />Not exactly.<br /><br />Graves has been  telling supporters and voters about his efforts to work with Linder on  the FairTax.<br /><br />&quot;I&rsquo;ve traveled the country advocating for the  FairTax, along with Herman Cain, Neal Boortz and John Linder,&quot; Graves, a  former state representative, said at an April 23 candidate debate at  the Georgia Mountains Center in Gainesville.<br /><br />Linder, who  represents Georgia's 7th Congressional District and is retiring at the  end of this term, says that's an exaggeration. The congressman took the  unusual step of accusing Graves, a fellow Republican, of lying about his  efforts to push the idea. Linder even said he \"didn't know who [Graves]  was or why he was there.\"<br /><br />\"Tom Graves is telling you that he has  traveled the nation with John Linder to sell the FairTax. That simply  is not true,\" Linder said in a 30-second robocall on May 27 for Graves&rsquo;  opponent, Lee Hawkins.<br /><br />The congressman added: &quot;If a candidate is  willing to lie to you to get elected, what will you expect from him  after he is elected?&quot;<br /><br />The Graves campaign said it is surprised by  Linder&rsquo;s remarks and baffled by Linder's seeming unfamiliarity with the  candidate.<br /><br />&quot;It&rsquo;s kind of bizarre for the congressman to say he  didn&rsquo;t know what he [Graves] was doing there,&quot; said Graves campaign  spokesman Tim Baker, who added the two men traveled together to the  event.<br /><br />We decided to check out how involved Graves has been with  Linder to sell the FairTax.<br /><br />First, what is the FairTax? It would  abolish all federal personal and corporate income taxes and other taxes,  and replace them with a federal retail sales tax, according to the Web  site FairTax.org. It essentially is a consumption tax -- the more you  buy, the more tax you pay.<br /><br />The FairTax is an important cause to  Linder. He&rsquo;s been advocating the idea for more than a decade and  co-wrote a book with Boortz explaining its benefits. <br /><br />Jennifer  Drogus, Linder's communications director, said her boss appreciates  Graves' support for the FairTax. But Linder felt like Graves exaggerated his role in the effort.<br /><br />We asked Graves campaign  officials whether they thought their candidate was exaggerating things a  bit by saying he &quot;traveled the country&quot; in support of the idea.<br /><br />&quot;The  record speaks for itself,&quot; said Baker, the campaign manager. &quot;If you  look at the fact, he was there.&quot;<br /><br />When asked whether they made  other trips to talk about the FairTax, the Graves campaign focused on  that Missouri trip as proof that their candidate is correct. Yes, they  made a trip halfway across the country. But we think one trip to  Missouri does not equate to &quot;traveled the country.&quot;<br /><br />We find Tom  Graves&rsquo; claim is Barely True.</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
