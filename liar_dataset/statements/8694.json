So a quarter of our workers make $18,000 per year. And no other industrialized country has that kind of record.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if she was correct that &quot;a quarter of our workers make $18,000 per year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found data from the U.S. Census Bureau that addresses the question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Census data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Census Bureau data breaks down wage and salaried workers by ranges of income, from &quot;$1 to $2,499&quot; to &quot;$100,000 and up.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data shows that 148.3 million Americans age 15 and up earned some wage or salary income in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of these workers, 33.5 million earned $17,500 or less. But to square it with Ghilarducci&rsquo;s income ranges, we need to adjust upwards a bit to account for those earning between $17,500 and $18,000. This adjustment makes the number approximately 35 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you divide these 35 million low-income workers by the total 148.3 million workers, the result is 24 percent -- right on target for Ghilarducci&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Some caveats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, we&rsquo;ll note a few important bits of context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Part-time workers</strong>. As it turns out, the bulk of these 35 million low-income workers -- 23.5 million, or about two-thirds -- worked part time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, some percentage of these 23.5 million workers -- perhaps a large percentage, given the slow economic recovery -- is working part time because they want a full-time job but can&rsquo;t find one. But others may prefer working part time, such as students or parents of young children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted Ghilarducci, she agreed that this was an issue and forwarded <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t08.htm\"><u>recent data</u></a> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggesting that about one-third of part time workers are doing so because they can&rsquo;t find an acceptable full-time job, while two-thirds are working for non-economic reasons. This suggests that it&rsquo;s wrong to assume that all, or even most, part-time workers are doing so because of the poor economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Partial-year workers</strong>. The Census data also tracks how much of the year workers spent on the job. The data shows that 14.8 million people who earned less than $18,000 worked 26 weeks or less. In other words, 42 percent of all workers earning under $18,000 worked for half the year or less. They might have earned well above that if they&rsquo;d been paid at that rate for the full year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This offers another reminder that it&rsquo;s wrong to view Ghilarducci&rsquo;s statistic as suggesting that one-quarter of all workers with a full-time, full-year job are making $18,000 or less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An alternative number</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look at just the workers who had a full-time job and worked all year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Census data shows that 98.3 million workers had full-time jobs for the whole year. Of those, about 8.8 million earned $18,000 or less -- just shy of 9 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is this a better number? Not necessarily -- both have merit, and both are imperfect. Ghilarducci&rsquo;s one-quarter overestimates the number of low-income workers because it includes Americans working part-time voluntarily, or who, by choice or not, may have worked for only for a part of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, the alternative number -- 9 percent -- does the reverse, underestimating the number of low-income workers by not including Americans who are working part-time jobs when they would actually like to have a full-time job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ghilarducci thanked PunditFact for checking up on her work. &quot;It is important for yakkers on TV to footnote!&quot; she said. &quot;I think I will change my behavior and not give interviews without a follow up with footnotes of my own. So you saved me work. Thank you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ghilarducci said that &quot;a quarter of our workers make $18,000 per year.&quot; Census data backs up this top-line number, but beneath the surface, there are reasons for caution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number she cites does not refer exclusively to full-year, full-time jobs. Rather, it includes lots of people who had a low income because they worked in a part-time job, or worked for just part of the year. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-12-20T12:49:45.959466", "ruling_date": "2013-12-23T10:00:18", "ruling_headline": "Economist Teresa Ghilarducci says a quarter of U.S. workers earn $18,000 or less", "ruling_headline_slug": "economist-teresa-ghilarducci-says-quarter-us-worke", "ruling_link_text": "A word of caution about the number", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Teresa Ghilarducci, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/up/watch/when-a-job-cant-get-you-out-of-poverty-91855939622\"><u>comments on MSNBC&rsquo;s </u><u>Up</u></a>, Dec. 15, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Census Bureau, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/cpstables/032013/perinc/pinc10_1.xls\"><u>Table PINC-10.
