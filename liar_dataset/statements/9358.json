Elizabeth Warren is making the rounds to promote her new book, <em>A Fighting Chance</em>. In addition to dispelling speculation about a presidential bid in 2016, the Massachusetts Democrat and former Harvard law professor continued to make a case for greater government intervention in the financial sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/sen-warren-takes-washington-give-working-class-americans-fighting-chance/\"><u>PBS Newshour</u></a> May 19, 2014, Warren said there&rsquo;s a need to &quot;break up these banks,&quot; which have only gotten bigger since the financial collapse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You know, you talked about during the financial crisis we were told these banks are too big to fail,&quot; Warren said. &quot;Today, the five largest financial institutions are 38 percent bigger than they were back in 2008, when they were too big to fail.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found several other instances of Warren giving out this stat, and we thought it was worth a review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Doing the math</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warren&rsquo;s office said the anaylsis came from SNL Financial, a private bank researching firm, and they pointed us to <a href=\"http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2013/09/13/too-big-to-fail-banks/\">a CNN article</a> describing the report. It found assets from&nbsp;the top six banks were up 37 percent. That&#39;s six banks, not five, as Warren said, and the article was from September 2013, so it&#39;s a little outdated. Therefore,&nbsp;we decided to do the math ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we dug in, we realized there are two ways to interpret Warren&rsquo;s statement. Was she comparing the current top five banks with their pre-recession size? Or was she comparing today&rsquo;s top five to 2008&rsquo;s top five?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to analyze it both ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what we found when we looked at the top five banks in 2013 (the latest available data) and the top five of 2008&nbsp;(we went with reported assets in the middle of the year, i.e. before Congress passed the bank bailout).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Top five banks of 2013</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:600px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Bank</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Total Assets</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$2,415,689,000,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Bank of America Corporation</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$2,104,995,000,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Citigroup Inc.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1,880,382,000,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Wells Fargo &amp; Company</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1,527,015,000,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$911,585,000,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Total</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>$8,839,676,000,000</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Top five banks of 2008</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:600px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Bank</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\" style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Total Assets</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Citigroup Inc.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$2,100,385,000,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1,775,670,000,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Bank of America</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1,723,269,816,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Wachovia Corporation</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$812,443,000,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Taunus Corporation</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$659,772,000,000</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Total</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>$6,411,757,816,000</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do the math, the top five from the end of 2013 have 38 percent more assets than the top five banks of 2008.

It&rsquo;s held back by Citigroup, which actually has fewer total assets than it did in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being in the top five doesn&rsquo;t necessarily equate to &quot;too big to fail,&quot; even though Warren seemed to imply as much. For example, Wachovia was a top five bank in 2008, and it no longer exists. It was absorbed by Wells Fargo during the fallout of the crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warren&rsquo;s comment &quot;presumes simply that there is a threshold &lsquo;too big to fail&rsquo; size, and implies that the top five having gotten bigger, they were already past that threshold, and (now) are even more &lsquo;too big to fail,&rsquo; &quot; said Satya Thallam, director of financial services policy at the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. &quot;The size of financial institutions is not <em>per se</em> evidence of &lsquo;too big to fail&rsquo; expectations.&quot; Other experts we spoke with echoed that sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also other ways to measure bank size, such as total deposits, said Hester Peirce, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These are very tricky comparisons to make,&quot; Peirce said. &quot;There&rsquo;s not a clear way to measure how size has changed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How they got so big</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warren does not mention how the banks grew, which experts we spoke with said is critical context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the Wachovia/Wells Fargo example. In 2008, Wells Fargo was the sixth-largest bank, just outside Warren&rsquo;s arbitrary cutoff. So a significant reason the top five have grown so much is from that one transaction, where two massive banks become one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Wells Fargo/Wachovia is just one example. Lawrence White, a professor of economics at New York University, noted that Bank of America absorbed Merrill Lynch, which, at the end of 2007, had more than $1 trillion in assets, and JPMorgan Chase took on Bear Stearns, a top 15 financial institution before its collapse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the financial crisis, the federal government was &quot;desperate to have these banks merge,&quot; Peirce said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That is a large contributing factor (in the growth of the top five),&quot; she said. &quot;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the only thing that&rsquo;s going on, but that&rsquo;s one of the things that&rsquo;s going on.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not to say these weren&rsquo;t controversial decisions. Warren, for the record, opposed those efforts and has said they have made the &quot;too big to fail&quot; issue worse. But understanding how it happened is critical to forming an opinion on what the numbers actually mean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peirce also said consolidation and growth among the top banks are not a new trend. In 2001, <a href=\"http://mercatus.org/publication/decline-us-small-banks-2000-2013\"><u>the five largest banks</u></a> held about 27.5 percent of all assets; today it&rsquo;s closer to 47 percent with the sharpest increases coming before the financial collapse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warren said, &quot;the five largest financial institutions are 38 percent bigger than they were back in 2008, when they were too big to fail.&quot; Without fully understanding where her math was coming from, we had to find our own way to measure this. One way seemed to back her up in a narrowly defined time frame. A different method produced a lower number, though the trend is the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our experts took some issue with her loose characterization of &quot;too big too fail&quot; and some of the context she left out. But her underlying point is largely accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate her comment Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-05-22T16:08:57.573571", "ruling_date": "2014-05-22T17:27:02", "ruling_headline": "Elizabeth Warren says the top five banks are 38 percent larger than at the time of the bailout", "ruling_headline_slug": "elizabeth-warren-says-top-five-banks-are-38-percen", "ruling_link_text": "Too bigger to fail?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PBS Newshour, <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/sen-warren-takes-washington-give-working-class-americans-fighting-chance/\"><u>interview with Sen.
