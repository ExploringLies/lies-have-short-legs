Moreover, the &quot;sponsored a buy American bill&quot; message suggests the fight she led affected more than just Wisconsin manufacturers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s see what happened.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Baldwin&rsquo;s engine amendments</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe didn&rsquo;t find any news stories in the Nexis database about any congressional battles over Coast Guard engines, but Baldwin did introduce amendments on the matter three different times.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBaldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus cited those amendments as evidence to back her claim.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>June 2003:</strong> The amendment would have prohibited buying new Coast Guard cutters unless their engines were made in the United States &quot;by a domestically operated entity.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKraus said that would have ruled out engines provided by Detroit Diesel, which was owned by German-based Daimler-Chrysler, &quot;leaving only one possible source for diesel engines: Wisconsin-based Fairbanks Morse.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fairbanksmorse.com/\">Fairbanks Morse </a><a href=\"http://www.fairbanksmorse.com/\">Engine</a> is in Beloit, in <a href=\"http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/district/district-map-info.shtml\">Baldwin&rsquo;s district</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, Baldwin&rsquo;s first amendment focused on getting more business for one Wisconsin company, not American manufacturers generally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo vote was taken on Baldwin&rsquo;s amendment, a Library of Congress <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:hz186:\">record</a> shows. It was ruled out of order because it proposed &quot;to change existing law and constituted legislation in an appropriations bill.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>November 2003:</strong> Baldwin introduced a slightly different amendment. It would have required that engines purchased for the Coast Guard&rsquo;s new fleet of ships be made in America, according to a <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-11-05/pdf/CREC-2003-11-05-pt1-PgH10396.pdf#page=26\">transcript</a> of House proceedings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKraus pointed out that this amendment didn&rsquo;t prohibit engines being made in the U.S. by a foreign-operated company.<br />\r\n.<br />\r\n(Interestingly, we found that Baldwin introduced this amendment with U.S. Rep. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/paul-ryan/\">Paul Ryan</a>, R.-Wis., the running mate of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Ryan argued that many defense contracts had made-in-America requirements, which he said help national security by ensuring that needed goods are available in the U.S.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe amendment was rejected on a voice vote.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>June 2011:</strong> Baldwin&rsquo;s third amendment used language similar to the first. And like the first amendment, it was ruled <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:hz399:\">out of </a><a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:hz399:\">order</a> and didn&rsquo;t come up for a vote.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe asked Kraus about the message on the screen in the ad -- which said Baldwin sponsored a &quot;BUY American bill&quot; -- since that sounded like it might be a separate legislation, not merely an amendment. There have been various bills requiring the purchase of American-made goods over the years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut Kraus said the message on the screen was merely another reference to the three amendments that Baldwin introduced.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nBaldwin said: &quot;I led the fight to require the Coast Guard to buy their engines from us, not foreign companies.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough there isn&rsquo;t evidence of much of a fight, her statement contains an element of truth in that she introduced three amendments aimed at benefiting a Wisconsin manufacturer. But the ad is misleading in suggesting that her fight was successful, when none of the measures she introduced became law. What&rsquo;s more, it suggests it was part of a broader &quot;Buy American&quot; push, not measures aimed at helping a company in her district.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe rate Baldwin&rsquo;s statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-16T18:37:23.691689", "ruling_date": "2012-08-22T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tammy Baldwin Dem Senate candidate \"led the fight to require the Coast Guard to buy engines from us\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-rep-tammy-baldwin-dem-us-senate-candidat", "ruling_link_text": "No real battle, let alone a battle won", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Tammy Baldwin campaign, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PuH0ynsRHM&amp;feature=g-all-u\">TV ad</a>, July 30, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTammy Baldwin campaign, TV ad <a href=\"http://www.tammybaldwin.com/news/2012/tammy-baldwin-releases-new-tv-ad-engines/\">news release</a>, July 30, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterview and e-mail interview, Tammy Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus, Aug. 13 and 15, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nU.S. Government Printing Office, Admiral Thomas Collins Senate subcommittee <a href=\"http://bulk.resource.org/gpo.gov/hearings/109s/21672.txt\">testimony</a>, March 17, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nU.S. Government Printing Office, <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-06-24/pdf/CREC-2003-06-24-pt1-PgH5744-3.pdf#page=41\">transcript</a> of House discussion of Tammy Baldwin bill amendment (page 5783), June 24, 2003<br />\r\n<br />\r\nU.S. Government Printing Office, <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2003-11-05/pdf/CREC-2003-11-05-pt1-PgH10396.pdf#page=26\">transcript</a> of House discussion of Tammy Baldwin bill amendment (page 10421), Nov. 5, 2003<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLibrary of Congress, Tammy Baldwin June 2003 bill amendment <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:hz186:\">history</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nLibrary of Congress, Tammy Baldwin June 2011 bill amendment <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:hz186:\">history</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nCongressional Research Service, <a href=\"http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1917&amp;context=key_workplace\">&quot;Domestic content legislation: The Buy American Act and complementary little buy American provisions,&quot;</a> April 25, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "U.S. Representative", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "Tammy", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 1410, "last_name": "Baldwin", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "tammy-baldwin", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PFACT_Tammy_Baldwin.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1410/", "total_count": 49, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://www.baldwin.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;I led the fight to require the Coast Guard to buy their engines from us, not foreign companies.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a TV ad", "statement_date": "2012-07-30", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 219, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/219/", "subject": "Message Machine 2012", "subject_slug": "message-machine-2012", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/", "/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 30, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/30/", "subject": "Military", "subject_slug": "military", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
