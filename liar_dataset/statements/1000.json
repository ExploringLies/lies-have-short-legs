During the fall of 2008, she nearly lost her re-election campaign because she said Barack Obama &quot;may have anti-American views.&quot; In a 2009 radio interview, she said incorrectly that six Muslim clerics who were removed from a US Airways flight in 2006 were attending a &quot;victory celebration&quot; for Keith Ellison, a Muslim who was elected to Congress.\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n So we weren't exactly surprised when we heard her suggest a link between Democratic presidents and the swine flu. Here's her comment, from an interview with Pajamas Media:\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n &nbsp;&quot;I find it interesting that it was back in the 1970s that the swine flu broke out then under another Democrat president, Jimmy Carter. And I'm not blaming this on President Obama, I just think it's an interesting coincidence.&quot;\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n Well, at least she's right about the decade. Yes, the last big swine flu scare occurred in the 1970s. But other than that, her statement is utterly false.\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n The scare began in February 1976 when recruits at Fort Dix, N.J., came down with flu symptoms, and one died. This led to fears of a pandemic. The president in 1976 was Gerald Ford &mdash; a Republican.\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n Ford, following the advice of public health officials, called for a nationwide vaccination program. In just 10 days, 40 million Americans were vaccinated. But three senior citizens died shortly after receiving their swine flu shots. A public outcry blamed the deaths on the immunizations even though there was no evidence. As a recent\n <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/04/28/1976_swine_flu/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"article in Salon\">\n  article in Salon\n </a>\n notes, &quot;The government had long feared mass panic about swine flu &mdash; now they feared mass panic about the swine flu vaccinations.&quot;\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n Political analyst Craig Crawford wrote this week that &quot;Gerald Ford's decision to inoculate every person in the country (including himself) resulted in a political debacle that contributed to a reputation for incompetence that scuttled his 1976 election bid.&quot;\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n Swine flu also surfaced briefly in 1988, killing a woman in Wisconsin who had visited a swine exhibit at a county fair. The president at the time was Ronald Reagan &mdash; a Republican.\n</p>\n<p>\n So Bachmann is wrong about a Democrat being in charge during the 1976 outbreak  and she fails to note the swine flu death in 1988. Hmmm. Two swine flu incidents  during Republican administrations. By Bachmann's logic, we should find that  &quot;interesting.&quot; But we don't. It's ridiculous for her to suggest a partisan link  with a deadly disease. That's not just a mistake, that's absurdly false. So  we'll get out the lighter (after we wash our hands!) and set the Truth-O-Meter  ablaze. This one's a Pants on Fire.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:27:46.408751", "ruling_date": "2009-04-30T18:20:28", "ruling_headline": "Michele Bachmann wrong that swine flu broke out under Carter ", "ruling_headline_slug": "michele-bachmann-wrong-70s-swine-flu-broke-our-", "ruling_link_text": "Swine flu isn't blue", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n YouTube,\n <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFDyxO4FLZQ&amp;feature=player_embedded\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Bachmann interview\n </a>\n , April 28, 2009\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n Political Punch blog,\n <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/10/michelle-bachma.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bachmann responds to conroversy\">\n  Bachmann responds to conroversy\n </a>\n , Oct. 28, 2008\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n KSFO Radio,\n <a href=\"http://bayradio.com/podcasts/KSFO7am040909.mp3\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Interview with Michelle Bachmann\">\n  Interview with Michelle Bachmann\n </a>\n , April 9, 2009\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n Politico,\n <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/glennthrush/0409/Bachmann_Flying_Imams_were_at_Ellison_party_.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bachmann: Flying Imams attended Ellison party\">\n  Bachmann: Flying Imams attended Ellison party\n </a>\n , April 16, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n Salon,\n <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/04/28/1976_swine_flu/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The last great swine flu epidemic\">\n  The last great swine flu epidemic\n </a>\n , April 28, 2009\n <br />\n <br />\n Craig Crawford in Huffington Post,\n <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/craig-crawford/obamas-swine-flu-challeng_b_191557.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Obama's great flu challenge\">\n  Obama's great flu challenge\n </a>\n , April 26, 2009\n <br />\n <br />\n Centers for Disease Control,\n <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/key_facts.htm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Influenza fact sheet\">\n  Key facts about Swine Influenza (Swine Flu)\n </a>\n , accessed April 30, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n &nbsp;\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "Congresswoman", "false_count": 22, "first_name": "Michele", "half_true_count": 6, "home_state": "Minnesota", "id": 149, "last_name": "Bachmann", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "michele-bachmann", "pants_count": 16, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Bachmann_mug_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/149/", "total_count": 61, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://bachmann.house.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>In the 1970s, &quot;the swine flu broke out . . . under another Democrat, President Jimmy Carter.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "an interview with Pajamas Media.", "statement_date": "2009-04-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
