Bush.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I asked this to President Bush when I talked to him a few weeks ago,&quot; O&rsquo;Reilly said to Obama. &quot;Does it disturb you that so many people hate you? No. I mean, it&#39;s a serious question.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA reader wrote to us to ask whether O&rsquo;Reilly did ask that question of Bush. So we looked into it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe discovered that O&rsquo;Reilly was referring to <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/oreilly/transcript/george-w-bush-sits-down-bill-o039reilly?page=9\">an interview aired on Nov. 11, 2010</a>, when Bush, by then out of office for almost two years, was doing publicity for his memoir, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Decision-Points-George-W-Bush/dp/0307590615/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1297183581&amp;sr=1-1\">Decision Points</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere&rsquo;s the exchange between O&rsquo;Reilly and Bush:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nO&rsquo;REILLY: &quot;Okay. But, the people in the press hated you, a lot of them. Why? Why?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBUSH : &quot;I don&rsquo;t know. You have to ask them. I&rsquo;m not a hater, and so sometimes it&rsquo;s hard for me to understand why somebody hates somebody. It could have been because of my policies, maybe they didn&rsquo;t like my religion. I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a myriad of reasons. That&rsquo;s what happens when you&rsquo;re the president. It can either bother you or not bother you. I chose --<br />\r\n<br />\r\nO&quot;REILLY: &quot;You ever think about it?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBUSH: &quot;Being hated? No, not really.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nO&rsquo;REILLY: &quot;Really? Never?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBUSH: &quot;No. I&rsquo;m a pretty comfortable guy right now, you know.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nO&rsquo;REILLY: &quot;You look it.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBUSH: &quot;I really am. I&rsquo;m honored to have served. I&rsquo;m glad I served, and I gave it my all, and that&rsquo;s all you can do at life. I got back -- and this sounds corny to some, I understand, but when I looked in the mirror, I know I didn&rsquo;t sell my soul for the sake of any short-term politics or popularity. I think that&rsquo;s important.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the record, here&rsquo;s how Obama answered O&rsquo;Reilly: &quot;You know, the truth is, that the people -- and I&#39;m sure previous presidents would say the same thing, whether it was Bush or Clinton or Reagan or anybody. The people who dislike you don&#39;t know you. &hellip; What they hate is whatever funhouse mirror image of you that&#39;s out there. &hellip; I think that by the time you get here, you have to have had a pretty thick skin. If you didn&#39;t, then you probably wouldn&#39;t have gotten here.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTechnically, O&rsquo;Reilly asked slightly different questions of each president. To Obama, he asked whether it disturbs him to be hated by &quot;so many&quot; Americans. To Bush, he asked how he felt about being hated by &quot;a lot of&quot; people in the press, and then followed up by asking him more generally if he ever thought about being hated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStill, O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s two lines of inquiry are similar enough that we&rsquo;re giving O&rsquo;Reilly a True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-08T11:59:48.865870", "ruling_date": "2011-02-08T13:56:52", "ruling_headline": "Bill O'Reilly tells Obama he also asked Bush about people hating him", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-oreilly-tells-obama-he-also-asked-bush-about-", "ruling_link_text": "Somewhat different wordings, same general point", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, <a href=\"http://www.politicsdaily.com/2011/02/06/transcript-of-president-obamas-pre-super-bowl-interview-with-bi/\">interview</a> with President Barack Obama, Feb. 6, 2011<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBill O&rsquo;Reilly, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/oreilly/transcript/george-w-bush-sits-down-bill-o039reilly?page=9\">interview</a> with President George W.
