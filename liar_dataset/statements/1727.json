Bill Young with jailed lobbyist Jack Abramoff. It is a case of  guilt by association without proving any association. In a separate  item, we've rated the suggestion of an Abramoff connection as Pants on  Fire. But the video makes other claims about Young, a Pinellas County  Republican, that have some truth to them, including one that Young used  campaign money for \"a luxury car.\"<br /><br />The video uses Abramoff's  fedora as a metaphor for the alleged ties between the two men. A copy of  the hat flips off Abramoff's head and lands on Young's. The screen   says that Abramoff \"used his money for, among other things, luxury  cars.\" The hat lands on Young as the screen says, \"Bill Young uses his  campaign money for, among other things, a luxury car.\"<br /><br />Putting  aside the sleight-of-hand implication of an Abramoff connection, it's  worth exploring the simple question of whether Young did indeed use  campaign money for a luxury car.<br /><br />The Justice campaign is  referring to a 1990 revelation in the<em> St. Petersburg Times</em> that Young  used campaign money to buy a Lincoln Continental for nearly $30,000.</p>\r\n<p>The <em> Times </em>article noted that he also billed the campaign for the new car's  taxes and title, \"a portable telephone and frequent fill-ups at the gas  station.\" The article said the purchase did not violate federal laws,  which give members wide discretion for spending campaign money.<br /><br />That,  however, was 20 years ago. Justice used the present tense in the words  on the screen, implying that Young is still paying for his car with  campaign contributions. We wondered if that part was true.<br /><br />Indeed,  though the model of car has changed -- it's a Lincoln Navigator now --   Young spokesman Harry Glenn told us that the campaign makes monthly  payments to lease the vehicle. He said the expenses have never been  questioned by the Federal Election Commission and that Young felt it was  better to use campaign money for the vehicle than taxpayer dollars as  other members of Congress do.<br /><br />According to an expenditure report  filed with the Federal Election Commission, in 2009 Young paid $799 per  month to Ford Motor Credit for the \"campaign vehicle.\" <br /><br />Is it  fair to call a Lincoln Navigator a luxury car? We'll start with the  price. The Web site says they start at $54,950, so it's definitely on  the high end. The Navigator is an SUV, but Justice's use of \"car\" seems  to suggest a vehicle rather than to specify a sedan. Lincoln describes  the Navigator as <a href=\"http://www.lincoln.com/about/default.asp?year=2000\" target=\"_blank\">\"the world's  first luxury SUV.\"</a> The \"premium leather-trimmed\" seats are  available in hues of Camel, Charcoal Black or Stone and have heating and  cooling built into the front seats. Sounds like luxury to us.<br /><br />So  Justice is right. Young used campaign money to buy the Lincoln  Continental in 1990, which was traded in many years ago. But he is still  using campaign money today to lease a Lincoln Navigator. Both can  reasonably be called luxury cars, so we find Justice's claim True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-04-26T13:43:19.409694", "ruling_date": "2010-04-26T17:34:30", "ruling_headline": "Justice says Young spent campaign money on a luxury car", "ruling_headline_slug": "justice-says-young-spent-campaign-money-luxury-car", "ruling_link_text": "A Lincoln Continental then, a Lincoln Navigator now", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO9f2eIJOn8\" target=\"_blank\">Young/Abramoff Video</a>,  accessed April 23, 2010.<br /> <br /> Politico, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/34391.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lawmakers  spend 1K/month on taxpayer-funded cars</a>, by Jake Sherman, March 15,  2010. <br /> <br /> OpenSecrets.org, <a href=\"http://209.190.229.99/1998elect/politicians/expendetail.php?cid=N00001817&amp;cycle=2010&amp;name=Ford%20Motor%20Credit\" target=\"_blank\">Bill  Young's 2010 Campaign Expenditures: Ford Motor Credit</a>, accessed  April 24, 2010.<br /> <br /> Florida Division of Elections, <a href=\"http://election.dos.state.fl.us/cgi-bin/expend.exe\" target=\"_blank\">Charlie  Justice's 2010 Campaign Expenditures</a>, accessed April 24, 2010.<br /> <br /> St. Petersburg Times, Campaigning in a luxury car, by David Dahl, Sep.  27, 1990.<br /> <br /> Phone interviews with Harry Glenn, spokesman for Bill Young campaign,  April 23, 2010.</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Charlie", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 333, "last_name": "Justice", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "charlie-justice", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NP_278209_garn_pharbor_2.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/333/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\"Bill Young uses his campaign money for, among other things, a luxury car.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a Web ad", "statement_date": "2010-04-14", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 35, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/35/", "subject": "Ethics", "subject_slug": "ethics", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 157, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/157/", "subject": "Message Machine 2010", "subject_slug": "message-machine", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "U.S. Representative, Florida District 10", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "C.W.
