That was so 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talking points from President Barack Obama&rsquo;s advisers are pointing to something new about Obamacare, something that sounds good: About <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/12/31/2-1-million-americans-signed-up-for-coverage-under-new-health-law/\"><u>2.1 million people</u></a> signed up for health insurance plans through the federal and state marketplaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC&rsquo;s <em>Meet the Press</em> host David Gregory posed a key follow-up question to Obama economic adviser Gene Sperling during the <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3032608/vp/53986107#53986107\"><u>Jan. 5 show</u></a>: Is the progress good enough for the administration to meet its original goal?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;2.1 million have signed up. The goal is 7 million by March. How do you think you realistically get there?&quot; Gregory said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, first of all, there&rsquo;s no magic number,&quot; Sperling said. &quot;The key is to enroll as many people, have an exchange that&rsquo;s working, have a stable exchange ...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The secretary of Health and Human Services said that was success, 7 million by March,&quot; Gregory said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think success is having an ongoing, strong market,&quot; Sperling said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact wanted to know: Is Sperling trying to rewrite the past by saying Obama had &quot;no magic number&quot; for the number of people that need to sign up for coverage by the end of open enrollment in March?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(We offer a hat-tip to our friend <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/03/the-white-houses-claim-that-7-million-enrolled-in-obamacare-was-never-our-target-number/\"><u>The Fact Checker</u></a> of the <em>Washington Post</em>, which recently visited this topic after White House health care adviser Phil Schiliro made a similar denial on MSNBC.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The 7 million mark</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were at least two times Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the official Obama appointed to oversee the agency in charge of implementing Obamacare, referred to 7 million as the mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number, though, didn&rsquo;t come from her. The figure originated with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes the impact of legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43900_ACAInsuranceCoverageEffects.pdf\"><u>February</u></a> 2013, CBO estimated 7 million people would sign up for health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces starting in October through the end of March, the deadline to enroll and avoid a tax penalty. By 2024, enrollment in the marketplaces would be 24 million, CBO said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sebelius offered cautious optimism about the target for enrollment in a <a href=\"http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20130624/NEWS/306249957\"><u>June press briefing</u></a> and pointed out the sheer size of the risk pool is not the only concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re hopeful that 7 million is a realistic target and that we&#39;re going to be driving our efforts toward that kind of enrollment effort,&quot; she said. &quot;And it&#39;s both about numbers and also hopefully getting a balanced risk pool.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/kathleen-sebelius-says-exchange-goal-is-7-million-by-march-93301.html#ixzz2pYgv2cF0\"><u>Politico story </u></a>covering her appearance opened with, &quot;For Obamacare the magic number is 7 million.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A leaked <a href=\"http://waysandmeans.house.gov/uploadedfiles/enrolltargets_09052013_.pdf\"><u>Sept. 5 memo</u></a> from another high-ranking HHS official, Marilyn Tavenner, to Sebelius outlined the department&rsquo;s month-by-month projections for enrollment. Drawing on the estimates from CBO, as well as &quot;the experience of Commonwealth Care in Massachusetts, Medicare Part D, and conversations with employers, issuers and states,&quot; Tavenner wrote that she expected marketplace enrollment to start at a slow pace but ramp-up in December and March, the months with deadlines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tavenner&rsquo;s memo anticipated 3.3 million people to have enrolled by Dec. 31, rising to 7.066 million by March 31.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, the estimates and targets from CBO and Tavenner happened before healthcare.gov made its dysfunctional debut. That was not part of the equation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Sept. 30, the night before the exchanges opened, <em><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/video/nightly-news/53150526#53150526\"><u>NBC </u><u>Nightly News</u></a> </em>aired an interview with Sebelius in which a reporter asked her, &quot;What does success look like?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think success looks like at least 7 million people having signed up by the end of March 2014,&quot; Sebelius said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next few weeks were not pretty, to say the least. The online federal marketplace wasn&rsquo;t ready, with big kinks preventing lots of people from buying plans. Some people, like <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/11/26/obamacare-wont-get-7-million-enrollees-in-2014-and-thats-okay/\"><u>Wonkblog&rsquo;s Ezra Klein</u></a>, argued CBO&rsquo;s estimates should be tossed because October and November were lost months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Obama administration considers someone to be &quot;enrolled&quot; if they select a plan, not necessarily if they paid for it. Data is not yet available for people who paid a first month&rsquo;s premium to their insurers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Couching it</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>HHS and White House spokespeople directed us to recent statements by administration officials whose answers about the 7 million goal mirror Sperling&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said on <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-dan-pfeiffer-sen-rand-paul-nate/story?id=20758560&amp;page=3\"><u>ABC&rsquo;s<em> </em></u><em><u>This Week</u></em></a><em> </em>on Nov. 3, &quot;Well, that&rsquo;s a goal that the CBO said is what they thought would happen. Our goal is to get as many people done as possible.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The position, said HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters, has been the mix of people is more important than the number. She pointed to Sebelius&rsquo; June comments and a late November <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/11/26/obamacare-wont-get-7-million-enrollees-in-2014-and-thats-okay/\"><u>post</u></a> by Klein, who said White House officials told him as he reported a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/07/17/obamas-last-campaign-inside-the-white-house-plan-to-sell-obamacare/\"><u>July story</u></a> they defined success as &quot;a function of the mix of people in the exchanges -- the &lsquo;ratio&rsquo; -- rather than the number of people in the exchanges.&quot; The administration made plans for a marketing campaign aimed at signing up young adults who tend to be healthier and uninsured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good health mix in each risk pool is crucial to control costs, and sick people who require more care &quot;are most likely to sign up and do so early,&quot; said Gail Wilensky, an expert on the health care law who was the director of Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, we don&rsquo;t know much background about the enrollees, such as health and payment status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama&rsquo;s officials are not backtracking so much as they are &quot;realizing that factors are coming into play that weren&rsquo;t expected,&quot; said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor who is an expert on the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I really think it&rsquo;s still possible by March to get 7 million,&quot; Jost said, adding that it&rsquo;s &quot;meaningless&quot; that there are not as many people signed up by the end of the year as once projected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other experts, such as Stan Dorn, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, have been quoted as saying the federal marketplace will function properly even with as low as 2 million enrollees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Everyone&#39;s been trumpeting this 7 million target,&quot; Dorn told <em><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/11/28/what-fixes-needed-at-health-website/3755543/\"><u>USA Today</u></a></em>. &quot;I think they can fall well short of it and still be on their way to a very successful program.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sperling denied the administration had a &quot;magic number&quot; for how many people it wanted to see enrolled through the exchanges for health insurance coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one knows how many people need to sign up to make the health care law&nbsp; work. And Sperling has a point that the mix of individuals signing up is likely more important than the raw number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Obama administration has used a number -- 7 million by March -- in the past. There&rsquo;s no denying that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-01-05T16:43:15.500234", "ruling_date": "2014-01-05T16:41:24", "ruling_headline": "Obama adviser Gene Sperling says administration offered 'no magic number' for health marketplace sign-ups", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-economic-adviser-gene-sperling-says-theres-n", "ruling_link_text": "Administration said 7 million was 'success'", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview with Gail Wilensky, Project HOPE senior fellow, Jan. 5, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University law professor, Jan. 5, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Jessica Santillo, White House spokeswoman, Jan. 5, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Joanne Peters, HHS spokeswoman, Jan. 5, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Budget Office, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43900_ACAInsuranceCoverageEffects.pdf\"><u>CBO&#39;s February 2013 Estimate of the Effects of the Affordable Care Act on Health Insurance Coverage</u></a>, February 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20130624/NEWS/306249957\"><u>Modern Healthcare</u></a>, &quot;Sebelius hopeful 7 million enrollees &lsquo;a realistic target,&rsquo; &quot;June 24, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC Nightly News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/video/nightly-news/53150526\"><u>Sebelius: &lsquo;We bear part of the responsibility&rsquo; for health care confusion</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 30, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HHS memo, &quot;<a href=\"http://waysandmeans.house.gov/uploadedfiles/enrolltargets_09052013_.pdf\"><u>Projected Monthly Enrollment Targets for Health Insurance Marketplaces in 2014</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>USA Today,</em> &quot;<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/11/28/what-fixes-needed-at-health-website/3755543/\"><u>Health care site improving, but still much to be done</u></a>,&quot; Nov. 28, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em> The Fact Checker, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/03/the-white-houses-claim-that-7-million-enrolled-in-obamacare-was-never-our-target-number/\"><u>The White House&rsquo;s claim that 7 million enrolled in Obamacare &lsquo;was never our target number</u></a>&rsquo;,&quot; Jan. 3, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em> Wonkblog, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/30/obamacare-just-might-net-its-7-million-sign-ups/\"><u>Obamacare just might net its 7 million signups</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 30, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post </em>Wonkblog, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/11/26/obamacare-wont-get-7-million-enrollees-in-2014-and-thats-okay/\"><u>Obamacare won&rsquo;t get 7 million enrollees in 2014 -- and that&rsquo;s okay</u></a>,&quot; Nov. 26, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/kathleen-sebelius-says-exchange-goal-is-7-million-by-march-93301.html\"><u>Kathleen Sebelius: Exchange enrollment goal is 7 million by March</u></a>,&quot; June 24, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Director of the National Economic Council ", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Gene", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 2568, "last_name": "Sperling", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "gene-sperling", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/031212_gene_sperling_myfirstjob_thumb.png", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2568/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nec/director"}, "statement": "<p>The Obama administration offered &quot;no magic number&quot; of people that needed to sign up for health care on the marketplaces.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\"", "statement_date": "2014-01-05", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
