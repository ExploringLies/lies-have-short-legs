He even cited his efforts to weaken pro-life and school choice legislation as unequivocal proof that he&#39;s a moderate. Now that he&#39;s running in a Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, Hasner&rsquo;s telling a different story, wearing a new masquerade mask every day.&#39;&#39;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered if Hasner cited his own efforts to weaken pro-life and school choice legislation as proof that he&#39;s a moderate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Abortion and school choice votes</b><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLeMieux spokesman Anna Nix directed us to two votes during Hasner&#39;s time in the Legislature from 2002-10 to back up the claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first vote relates to a 2004 resolution seeking to amend the state Constitution to require that parents be notified when their minor daughters seek abortions. Hasner supported an amendment to the resolution introduced by then-state Rep. Dan Gelber, a Miami Beach Democrat, which would have &quot;guaranteed&quot; a minor the right to bypass parental notification&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=686853.doc&amp;DocumentType=Amendments&amp;BillNumber=0001&amp;Session=2004\">with a judge&#39;s okay.</a>&nbsp;The amendment failed 42-73.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHasner supported the final version of the resolution and in fact&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=14592&amp;SessionIndex=-1&amp;SessionId=36&amp;BillText=&amp;BillNumber=&amp;BillSponsorIndex=0&amp;BillListIndex=0&amp;BillStatuteText=&amp;BillTypeIndex=0&amp;BillReferredIndex=0&amp;HouseChamber=H&amp;BillSearchIndex=0\">co-sponsored the legislation,</a>&nbsp;which included less stringent judicial bypass language than Gelber proposed. &quot;Mine was guaranteed that bypass be available,&quot; Gelber told PolitiFact Florida. &quot;I didn&#39;t trust the Legislature essentially to implement this with a view toward protecting minors.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHasner adviser Rick Wilson said that Hasner wanted to ensure the bill&#39;s constitutionality so he wanted to make sure it had judicial bypass language. And Hasner defended the constitutional amendment after voters approved it, according to a Nov. 6, 2004, article in the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/promises/carlos-o-meter/promise/958/no-lay-offs-police-or-firefighters/\">Boca Raton News</a></em>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second vote that LeMieux&#39;s campaign cited was against a bill that would have established the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Bills/floorvote.aspx?VoteId=4042&amp;BillId=13615&amp;SessionIndex=-1&amp;SessionId=36&amp;BillText=&amp;BillNumber=549&amp;BillSponsorIndex=0&amp;BillListIndex=0&amp;BillStatuteText=&amp;BillTypeIndex=0&amp;BillReferredIndex=0&amp;HouseChamber=H&amp;BillSearchIndex=0\">K-12 GI Bill Program</a>&nbsp;to allow dependents of a Florida veteran or an active duty member to attend a public school other than the one they were assigned to or a private school. On April 22, 2004, it passed the House 68-45 with Hasner listed as a &quot;No&quot; vote after roll call.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=13615&amp;SessionIndex=-1&amp;SessionId=36&amp;BillText=&amp;BillNumber=549&amp;BillSponsorIndex=0&amp;BillListIndex=0&amp;BillStatuteText=&amp;BillTypeIndex=0&amp;BillReferredIndex=0&amp;HouseChamber=H&amp;BillSearchIndex=0\">The bill ultimately died.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn Oct. 3, 2004, article in the <em>Sun-Sentinel</em> paraphrased Hasner as saying that &quot;<a href=\"http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-10-03/news/0410030108_1_affordable-health-care-human-rights-council-campaign-contributors\">he supports the state&#39;s voucher program but voted against expanding it to military families</a>&nbsp;until stricter accountability measures have been put in place.&quot; However, Hasner voted&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=10280&amp;SessionIndex=-1&amp;SessionId=28&amp;BillText=&amp;BillNumber=805&amp;BillSponsorIndex=0&amp;BillListIndex=0&amp;BillStatuteText=&amp;BillTypeIndex=0&amp;BillReferredIndex=0&amp;HouseChamber=H&amp;BillSearchIndex=-1\">in favor of a similar bill the year before</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn both cases, there are some caveats to the votes. Hasner actually co-sponsored the parental notification bill, which included language whereby a minor could not notify their parents about their desire to get an abortion by instead asking a judge. But Hasner voted for an amendment with stricter judicial bypass language.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Hasner voted for a bill in 2003 that would have expanded a school voucher program for dependents of Florida service members but voted against a similar bill in 2004, because he said he wanted stricter accountability measures first put in place.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe votes, however, are only half the story, since LeMieux claimed that Hasner cited them as proof he was moderate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Campaign mailer</b><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor that part of the fact-check, LeMieux&#39;s campaign sent us to a mailer Hasner sent when he was running for re-election as a state representative in 2004 in which&nbsp;<a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2011/08/oops-adam-hasners-old-campaign-mailer-used-the-m-word-moderate.html\">he used the word &quot;moderate&quot;</a>&nbsp;to describe himself. Hasner was running at the time in a Republican-leaning Palm Beach-Broward district.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Re-elect Hasner... A rising star with moderate leanings ... works behind the scenes for school funding ... can move opinion and craft meaningful laws,&quot; said the mailer, pulling partial quotes from a pair of 2004 <em>Sun-Sentinel </em>articles. The mailer also quoted the<em> Boca Raton News </em>from 2004: &quot;well rounded in his views and not stuck on following party lines.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first <em>Sun-Sentinel </em>story was&nbsp;<a href=\"http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-05-16/news/0405131119_1_senate-leadership-democrats-legislative-agenda\">evaluating area state legislators after the 2004 session</a>&nbsp;and gave Hasner three out of five stars. &quot;A rising star with moderate leanings and leadership hopes, he (Hasner) has gotten several bills passed and works behind the scenes for funding for Palm Beach County schools and other interests.&quot; The article did not address Hasner&#39;s votes on abortion or school choice.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second story was an endorsement from the <em>Sun-Sentinel</em>&#39;s editorial board, which described&nbsp;<a href=\"http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-10-04/news/0410010649_1_legislative-districts-florida-house-state-s-voucher-programs\">him as a &quot;moderate voice.&quot;</a>&nbsp;&quot;He also wants to establish meaningful accountability and educational standards for the state&#39;s voucher programs.&quot; The endorsement did not address abortion and did not explain any efforts in detail Hasner took related to vouchers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe third article, which appeared in the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=11xUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Eo8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4023,2638455&amp;dq=not+stuck+oh+following+party+lines+boca+raton+news&amp;hl=en\">Boca Raton News</a></em>, came from the publisher and was about the editorial board preparing to make endorsements. The piece gave kudos to Hasner and called him an &quot;open-minded legislator&quot; but made no specific mention of his votes on abortion or school choice. &quot;Make no mistake about it he is a Republican, but, he unlike so many members of both parties seems to be willing to find resolution to issues based upon what&#39;s best for his constituents and not only what&#39;s best for his party.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere is, however a <em>Sun-Sentinel </em>article -- not quoted on the mailer the LeMieux campaign cited -- in which Hasner is paraphrased as citing his votes on abortion and/or school choice laws as examples of being a moderate. In the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-10-03/news/0410030108_1_affordable-health-care-human-rights-council-campaign-contributors\">Oct. 3, 2004, story</a>, Hasner&#39;s Democratic opponent Doug West claimed that Hasner&#39;s voting record closely resembled former Republican House Speaker Johnnie Byrd.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe article quoted Hasner as saying: &quot;Nothing could be farther from the truth.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd then it continued by paraphrasing Hasner: &quot;His voting record reflects the interests of the constituents of District 87, where Republicans hold only a slight majority, he said. Hasner cited votes in support of stem cell research and judicial bypass language in a parental notification bill and votes against a bill to expand the voucher program to families of active and retired military officers as proof he is a moderate Republican. The son of public school teachers, Hasner said he supports the state&#39;s voucher program but voted against expanding it to military families until stricter accountability measures have been put in place. He also would support a review of the state&#39;s tax exemptions by the nonpartisan group, Florida Tax Watch.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Our ruling</b><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLeMieux says that Hasner &quot;cited his efforts to weaken pro-life and school choice legislation as unequivocal proof that he&rsquo;s a moderate.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat we have here, based on our review, is a rare double cherry-pick. LeMieux has cherry-picked Hasner cherry-picking his own record. It is true that Hasner cited a vote on judicial bypass and expanding a voucher program as proof that he is a moderate Republican in 2004 and he did use the word &quot;moderate&quot; on his own mailer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut those 2004 votes have caveats of their own as we&#39;ve already detailed.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd being labeled a &quot;moderate&quot; does not tell the full picture of Hasner&#39;s voting record on the issues of abortion and school choice.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHasner&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Bills/floorvote.aspx?VoteId=11130&amp;BillId=43887&amp;SessionIndex=-1&amp;SessionId=64&amp;BillText=&amp;BillNumber=1143&amp;BillSponsorIndex=0&amp;BillListIndex=0&amp;BillStatuteText=&amp;BillTypeIndex=0&amp;BillReferredIndex=0&amp;HouseChamber=H&amp;BillSearchIndex=0\">voted in favor</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=43887&amp;SessionIndex=-1&amp;SessionId=64&amp;BillText=&amp;BillNumber=1143&amp;BillSponsorIndex=0&amp;BillListIndex=0&amp;BillStatuteText=&amp;BillTypeIndex=0&amp;BillReferredIndex=0&amp;HouseChamber=H&amp;BillSearchIndex=0\">a bill requiring women seeking abortions to undergo an ultrasound</a>&nbsp;and review it unless they signed a waiver. Gov. Charlie Crist vetoed the bill in June 2010. Hasner supported a 2008 bill that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=37553&amp;SessionIndex=-1&amp;SessionId=57&amp;BillText=abortion&amp;BillNumber=&amp;BillSponsorIndex=0&amp;BillListIndex=0&amp;BillStatuteText=&amp;BillTypeIndex=0&amp;BillReferredIndex=0&amp;HouseChamber=H&amp;BillSearchIndex=0\">required patients to review an ultrasound and that third-trimester abortions be performed in a hospital.</a>&nbsp;(That bill never made it into law.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHasner also voted in favor of the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program -- which provides a credit to taxpayers who contribute to organizations that award scholarships to students to attend private schools -- in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Bills/floorvote.aspx?VoteId=9387&amp;BillId=38054&amp;SessionIndex=-1&amp;SessionId=57&amp;BillText=&amp;BillNumber=653&amp;BillSponsorIndex=0&amp;BillListIndex=0&amp;BillStatuteText=&amp;BillTypeIndex=0&amp;BillReferredIndex=0&amp;HouseChamber=B&amp;BillSearchIndex=0\">2008</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Bills/floorvote.aspx?VoteId=9732&amp;BillId=40353&amp;SessionIndex=-1&amp;SessionId=61&amp;BillText=&amp;BillNumber=453&amp;BillSponsorIndex=0&amp;BillListIndex=0&amp;BillStatuteText=&amp;BillTypeIndex=0&amp;BillReferredIndex=0&amp;HouseChamber=B&amp;BillSearchIndex=0\">2009</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Bills/floorvote.aspx?VoteId=10728&amp;BillId=43814&amp;SessionIndex=-1&amp;SessionId=64&amp;BillText=scholarship&amp;BillNumber=&amp;BillSponsorIndex=0&amp;BillListIndex=0&amp;BillStatuteText=&amp;BillTypeIndex=0&amp;BillReferredIndex=0&amp;HouseChamber=H&amp;BillSearchIndex=0\">2010</a>. All were approved by Gov. Crist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUltimately, it looks like Hasner stretched the truth to appeal to moderate voters in 2004 and that LeMieux stretched the truth in his attack on Hasner in 2011.
