Kelly Ayotte <a href=\"http://www.concordmonitor.com/readerservices/politicsblogxml/17602606-95/ayotte-facing-a-whole-new-political-ballgame\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>used a regional example</u></a> to explain the size of the federal deficit. She said the deficit -- some $483 billion last year -- would buy 40 gallons of maple syrup for every man, woman and child in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ayotte has used that example before, including a <a href=\"http://www.ayotte.senate.gov/?p=news&amp;id=1719\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>January town meeting</u></a> in Goffstown. And she has used other colorful examples to illustrate the size of our nation&rsquo;s deficit, telling voters in 2013 that it could pay &quot;all of the 2013 salaries of every professional baseball player for the next 248 years.&quot; (That was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2013/nov/18/kelly-ayotte/ayotte-compares-size-federal-deficit-baseball-sala/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>True</u></a>, by the way.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about the maple syrup comparison? Would $483 billion cover that 40 gallons for every U.S. resident? PolitiFact decided to check the math.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a story of three numbers. The first is the U.S. budget deficit, <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/49892/49892-breakout-Summary.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>which can easily be found</u></a> in information from the official Congressional Budget Office. The deficit is the amount that the country runs short each year -- the difference between its income and expenses -- and shouldn&rsquo;t be confused with the national debt, which is much larger because it&rsquo;s the cumulative total of all past deficits, minus surpluses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The office&rsquo;s report from January puts the 2014 deficit at $483 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second number is the population of the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/popclock/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>which keeps close track</u></a> of such things, the nation had 320 million people by the end of 2014. (It&rsquo;s added 1.3 million since then.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dividing<strong> </strong>those two numbers, then, means<strong> </strong>that each person in the country has $1,509.40 of our nation&rsquo;s deficit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That then leads to our third number: the price of maple syrup. How much of the flapjack topping could $1,509.40 buy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately,<strong> </strong>the U.S. Department of Agriculture tracks maple syrup prices, through its National Agriculture Statistics Service. It <a href=\"http://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/New_England_includes/Publications/Crop_Production/Maple%20Syrup%202015.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>issued a bunch of numbers</u></a> last month that can help us out. According those numbers, the average price of a gallon of maple syrup in New Hampshire in 2014 -- the same year as our $483 billion deficit and our 320 million population -- was $57.80.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That generally tracks with local farm prices. When we checked,<strong> </strong>Corlis Farm in Northfield <a href=\"http://corlissfarm.com/sugarhouse/index.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>was charging $55 a gallon</u></a>. Maple Ridge Sugar House in Loudon was <a href=\"http://mapleridgesugarhouse.com/products.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>charging $58 per gallon</u></a>. And last year, Sunnyside Maples in Gilmanton was <a href=\"http://sunnysidemaples.com/sales/Sunnyside_Maples_Retail_Brochure_2014.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>charging $55 for a gallon</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USDA figure was backed up by the New Hampshire Maple Producers Association. According to association publicist Robyn Pearl, it&rsquo;s not going to go down anytime soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The price has been on a slow yet steady increase over the years, which reflects the same increase in production costs,&quot; Pearl said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we use that $57.80 average, Ayotte&rsquo;s claim gets, well, a little sticky. That $1,509.40 per U.S. resident would only buy a bit more than 26 gallons of syrup, not 40.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We checked with Ayotte&rsquo;s office to see what figures they were using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They referred us to the same set of statistics on maple prices -- <a href=\"http://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/New_England_includes/Publications/0605mpl.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>from a year earlier</u></a> -- but pointed to different numbers. They used the U.S. average price per gallon, which was $37.40 for 2013, and the New Hampshire wholesale price for syrup, which was $37.90 per gallon in 2012 and $46.10 per gallon in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using that national average price per gallon indeed yields 40 gallons of syrup per person, but Ayotte&rsquo;s office confirmed she was talking about New Hampshire made maple syrup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking just at the New Hampshire numbers, the 2012 wholesale price for a gallon of syrup comes close, although the 2013 wholesale price yields only 32.8 gallons per person. (<a href=\"http://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/New_England_includes/Publications/Crop_Production/Maple%20Syrup%202015.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The 2014 wholesale price</u></a>, which wasn&rsquo;t cited by Ayotte&rsquo;s staff, is $42.40 per gallon, which would given each person 35.6 gallons.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But those at Ayotte&rsquo;s town hall meeting know they&#39;re not paying wholesale prices at their local sugar house, where gallons of syrup are going for well over $50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a broader point here, of course. The senator&rsquo;s statement was meant to give residents a handle on an otherwise incomprehensible figure -- the size of the U.S. budget deficit. That&rsquo;s what Ayotte&rsquo;s staff said she hoped to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just for fun, we decided to calculate how long 40 gallons of syrup would last the average American. While some of us in the Northeast might consume a gallon or more a year (don&rsquo;t tell the dentist), the national average is between 2.5 to 4 ounces per person, according to the <a href=\"http://www.agmrc.org/commodities__products/specialty_crops/maple-sugar-profile/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Agricultural Marketing Resource Center</u></a> and <a href=\"http://northernwoodlands.org/articles/article/maple-bubble\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Center for Northern Woodlands Education</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, 40 gallons of syrup should last the average American more than 160 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And never mind the fact that giving that much syrup to everyone in the United States would be a sticky situation. New Hampshire only made 112,000 gallons of syrup in 2014, and there were only 3.2 million gallons produced in the United States that year; enough to give one gallon to every 100 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the words of Warner syrup producer Barbara Lassonde, &quot;We don&#39;t make that much, and if we tapped every maple tree in the Northeastern quadrant of the country, I still don&#39;t believe we&#39;d make enough.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte said the federal budget deficit is big enough to be able to buy 40 gallons of maple syrup for every resident of the United States. Ayotte&rsquo;s office said she was calculating it based on generic U.S.-made syrup, but that&rsquo;s considerably less expensive than New Hampshire-made syrup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we were buying New Hampshire syrup wholesale using 2014 prices, the amount would come closer, but still not hit a full 40 gallons. And if we use retail costs in New Hampshire, it works out to 26 gallons, not 40.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So her numbers are open to question, but her general point is valid: Either figure represents more than a lifetime supply for the average maple muncher in America. We rate the claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-07-22T14:51:34.924210", "ruling_date": "2015-07-22T14:49:38", "ruling_headline": "Ayotte says deficit could pay for 40 gallons of New Hampshire maple syrup for everyone in the U.S.", "ruling_headline_slug": "ayotte-says-deficit-could-pay-40-gallons-new-hamps", "ruling_link_text": "Not quite that much", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Correspondence with Kelly Ayotte staff, July 15-17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.concordmonitor.com/readerservices/politicsblogxml/17602606-95/ayotte-facing-a-whole-new-political-ballgame\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Ayotte facing a whole new political ballgame,&quot;</u></a> <em>Concord Monitor</em>, July 5, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ayotte.senate.gov/?p=news&amp;id=1719\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Ayotte talks about Medicare, deficit during town hall meeting in Goffstown,&quot;</u></a> <em>Union-Leader</em>, Jan. 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2013/nov/18/kelly-ayotte/ayotte-compares-size-federal-deficit-baseball-sala/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Kelly Ayotte compares size of federal deficit, baseball salaries,&quot;</u></a> PolitiFact New Hampshire, Nov. 18, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/49892/49892-breakout-Summary.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2015 to 2025,&quot;</u></a> Congressional Budget Office, January 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.census.gov/popclock/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>U.S. and World Population Clock,</u></a> United States Census Bureau</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/New_England_includes/Publications/Crop_Production/Maple%20Syrup%202015.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Northeast Maple Syrup Production,&quot;</u></a> National Agricultural Statistics Service, USDA, June 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://corlissfarm.com/sugarhouse/index.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2015 Maple Syrup Prices,</u></a> Corliss Farm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://mapleridgesugarhouse.com/products.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Try Our Products!</u></a> Maple Ridge Sugar House</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://sunnysidemaples.com/sales/Sunnyside_Maples_Retail_Brochure_2014.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Order Form,</u></a> Sunnyside Maples, Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Correspondence with Robyn Pearl, New Hampshire Maple Producers publicist, July 15-17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Correspondence with Barbara Lassonde, July 15-17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/New_England_includes/Publications/0605mpl.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Northeast Maple Syrup Production,&quot;</u></a> National Agricultural Statistics Service, USDA, June 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.agmrc.org/commodities__products/specialty_crops/maple-sugar-profile/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Maple sugar profile</u></a>, Agricultural Marketing Resource Center, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://northernwoodlands.org/articles/article/maple-bubble\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;A Maple Bubble?
