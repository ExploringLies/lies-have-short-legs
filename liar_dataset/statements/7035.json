Twenty-three million people can&#39;t find full-time work, and we borrow $4 billion every single day, much of it from China.

We need someone who could turn it around fast, and that man is Mitt Romney. There&#39;s not much time left, and the future of our country is at stake.</em></blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s been more than a year since we&rsquo;ve checked similar claims that the country borrows $4 billion a day &mdash; something we found <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/apr/15/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-leaders-borrowing-4-billion/\">Mostly</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/apr/11/saxby-chambliss/senators-ring-alarm-about-4-billion-debt-problem/\">True</a>. We wondered: Is that still the case? And do we borrow &quot;much of it&quot; from China?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe asked American Crossroads spokesman Jonathan Collegio for evidence for the ad&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&#39;m going to let you take a crack at that and get back to me,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe sent him a brief roundup of what we had found so far. We didn&rsquo;t hear back.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> How much we borrow</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe federal government doesn&rsquo;t literally borrow money every day, but through <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/apr/15/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-leaders-borrowing-4-billion/\">periodic bond auctions</a>. So we assumed the ad used an average.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s one way to do the math on $4 billion a day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe total federal debt on the day the ad was released, <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">according to the Treasury Department</a>, was $16.2 trillion. On the day Obama took office, it was $10.6 trillion. That&rsquo;s a gain of $5.6 trillion &mdash; about $4 billion a day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are a few nits to pick with this math. First, we&rsquo;re not currently borrowing that much. Over the last year, the average has been about $3.4 billion a day, not $4 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecond, that&rsquo;s using a measure of the entire federal debt &mdash; including the <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/debt/debtbasics.html\">big chunk we owe ourselves</a> that&rsquo;s held by government accounts such as the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Debt held by the public&quot; is the the amount the federal government has actually borrowed <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/debt/debtbasics.html#difference\">to finance deficits</a>. And the amount added to the public debt since Obama took office averages about $3.7 billion a day, not $4 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, this part of the claim is pretty close.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> &lsquo;Much of it from China&rsquo;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen there&rsquo;s the part about China. This is where the ad&rsquo;s claim gets goofy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf we assume Eastwood&rsquo;s talking about what&rsquo;s been added to the entire federal debt since Obama took office &mdash; the amount that averages $4 billion a day &mdash; here&rsquo;s how much as of August <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfh.txt\">China</a> <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfhhis01.txt\">owns</a>: 7.7 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf someone told you that there were two pieces to our recent debt, one piece under 8 percent and one piece above 92 percent, then asked you which of those pieces represented &quot;much of it,&quot; what would you say? We&rsquo;re guessing the non-Chinese piece.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, China is the <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfh.txt\">No. 1</a> foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities. (<a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfh.txt\">About a third</a> of our <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">total debt</a> is held by foreigners.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the main concern about U.S. public debt held by foreigners is mainly what might happen if they all stopped buying. It could drive up U.S. interest rates, said Wayne Morrison, a specialist in Asian trade and finance for the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoes that give China some sort of leverage? Or what if they sold off their U.S. securities all at once, sparking some kind of financial crisis?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Many economists argue that such a move is highly unlikely,&quot; Morrison told PolitiFact.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf China tried a big selloff, it would drive up supply of U.S. Treasuries and drive down their value &mdash; tanking the value of <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-11/china-s-u-s-debt-holdings-aren-t-threat-pentagon-says.html\">China&rsquo;s own holdings</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEastwood, speaking in a recent American Crossroads ad, warns that, &quot;We borrow $4 billion every single day, much of it from China.&quot; That amount is the rough daily average of all U.S. debt added since Obama took office, including the type the government owes itself. It&rsquo;s not the current rate, which has been somewhat lower. And while China is the No. 1 foreign holder of U.S. securities, it purchased less than 10 percent of that debt. This claim is only partly accurate. We rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-30T15:30:23.597702", "ruling_date": "2012-10-30T16:28:28", "ruling_headline": "Clint Eastwood says in ad that U.S. borrows $4B day, much 'from China\u2019", "ruling_headline_slug": "clint-eastwood-says-ad-us-borrows-4-billion-day-mu", "ruling_link_text": "Less than 10% from China", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCenter for Public Integrity, <a href=\"http://www.publicintegrity.org/2012/10/25/11618/daily-disclosure-adelson-spends-big-virginia-us-senate-race\">Daily Disclosure</a>, Oct. 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmerican Crossroads, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klXTb-s7d9A&amp;feature=plcp\">At Stake</a>,&quot; Oct. 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmerican Crossroads, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.americancrossroads.org/2012/10/new-12-6m-barrage-by-american-crossroads-slams-president-in-seven-states-one-new-ad-features-clint-eastwood/#more-1576\">New $12.6m Barrage by American Crossroads Slams President in Seven States &ndash; One New Ad Features Clint Eastwood</a>,&quot; Oct. 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Jonathan Collegio, Oct. 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Wayne Morrison, specialist in Asian trade and finance, Congressional Research Service, Oct. 26, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Kara Alaimo, spokeswoman, Treasury Department, Oct. 26, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTreasury Department, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">The Debt to the Penny and Who Holds It</a>,&quot; accessed Oct. 26, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTreasury Department, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfh.txt\">Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities</a>,&quot; Oct. 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTreasury Department, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfhhis01.txt\">Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities</a>(2011 revised),&quot; Sept. 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTreasuryDirect, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/resources/faq/faq_publicdebt.htm\">Frequently Asked Questions about the Public Debt</a>,&quot; accessed Oct. 26, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinancial Management Service, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.fms.treas.gov/bulletin/index.html\">Treasury Bulletin</a>,&quot; Sept. 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGovernment Accountability Office, <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/debt/debtbasics.html\">Federal Debt Basics</a>, accessed Oct. 26, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGovernment Accountability Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/debt/ownership.html#trends\">Ownership of Federal Debt: What are recent trends in the ownership of federal debt?</a>&quot; accessed Oct. 26, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBloomberg, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-11/china-s-u-s-debt-holdings-aren-t-threat-pentagon-says.html\">China&rsquo;s U.S. Debt Holdings Aren&rsquo;t Threat, Pentagon Says</a>,&quot; Sept. 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/apr/15/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-leaders-borrowing-4-billion/\">Sen.
