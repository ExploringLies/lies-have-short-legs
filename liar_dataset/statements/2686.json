Hurt is <a href=\"http://www.atr.org/atr-releases-list-pledge-signers-virginia-a5027\">one of seven challengers in Virginia congressional races</a> -- six Republicans and one independent -- to take the pledge, which the anti-tax group enforces strictly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe pledge for House candidates has two parts: They promise to oppose any increase in marginal income tax rates for citizens or businesses, and they vow to oppose the elimination of tax deductions or credits unless they are offset &quot;dollar for dollar&quot; by tax cuts or new credits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSimple enough. But it has given Democrats an opening to make a dubious connection to tax credits they portray as loopholes for shipping American jobs offshore.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has translated the second part of the pledge to mean that signers support tax loopholes for multinational companies operating in other countries. The DCCC backs up the claim not with the pledge the candidates actually signed, but with three specific bills opposed by Americans for Tax Reform that the group urged pledge signers to oppose. One of them was the <a href=\"http://atr.org/tax-pledge-alert-atr-keyvote-againstbr-a5298\">$26.1 billion bill</a> adopted in August to help states hire teachers and pay for Medicaid services. The money for those programs would come from closing the loopholes. Hurt <a href=\"http://www2.godanriver.com/news/2010/aug/10/perriello-votes-26-billion-aid-bill-ar-420898/\">opposed that bill</a>, citing the increase in federal spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats say the money from closing the loopholes was well-spent. &quot;Our point is if you&rsquo;re going to spend the money, it should be on creating jobs here,&quot; Jesse F. Ferguson, the DCCC&rsquo;s southern region press secretary, told us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the fact that someone signed the pledge doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean they are opposed to closing loopholes for off-shore companies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur friends at FactCheck.org have been knocking down this claim since April, when the DCCC ran a TV ad against <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2010/04/a-false-tax-attack/\">a Republican House candidate in Hawaii</a>. They recently debunked the same claim in an ad in the <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2010/10/a-new-twist-on-an-old-tax-attack/\">Massachusetts gubernatorial campaign</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the problem: The taxpayer pledge doesn&rsquo;t prevent a signer from opposing any tax break as long as he or she finds a way to offset the resulting increase in taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The pledge doesn&rsquo;t get into whether something is good or bad tax policy,&quot; Ryan Ellis, ATR&rsquo;s director of tax policy, told us. The pledge means that if a bill would result in a net tax increase, &quot;you&rsquo;re not free to vote for it,&quot; Ellis said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHurt hasn&rsquo;t offered specifics about his position on the offshore tax rules, but in <a href=\"http://www.roberthurtforcongress.com/2010/09/new-tv-ad-differently/\">a TV ad</a> last month, he called Perriello&rsquo;s claim false.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe agree. Perriello has chosen to rest his claim on the DCCC&rsquo;s spurious connection to the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, but that is a huge leap of logic and it doesn&rsquo;t prove Hurt supports the offshore loopholes. So we find the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-25T15:16:55.902347", "ruling_date": "2010-10-25T15:56:32", "ruling_headline": "Tom Perriello says Robert Hurt's support for \"Taxpayer Protection Pledge\" means he supports loopholes that send American jobs overseas", "ruling_headline_slug": "perriello-hurt-taxpayer-pledge-loophole-overseas", "ruling_link_text": "Hurt signed Taxpayer Protection Pledge, not a promise to close loopholes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTom Perriello campaign, <a href=\"http://www.perrielloforcongress.com/what-is-robert-hurt-hiding-tv-ad\">&quot;What is Robert Hurt hiding?&quot;,</a> Aug. 18, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmericans for Tax Reform, <a href=\"http://www.atr.org/userfiles/Congressional_pledge%281%29.pdf\">&quot;Taxpayer Protection Pledge.&quot;</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Quarterly, <a href=\"http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=news-000003269110&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=top-stories\">&quot;Vote haunts Virginia candidate,&quot;</a> Dec. 17, 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmericans for Tax Reform, <a href=\"http://www.atr.org/atr-releases-list-pledge-signers-virginia-a5027\">&quot;Federal Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers for 2010,&quot;</a> June 7, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmericans for Tax Reform, <a href=\"http://atr.org/tax-pledge-alert-atr-keyvote-againstbr-a5298\">&quot;Tax Pledge Alert: ATR will keyvote against state bailout/tax hike in House today,&quot;</a> Aug. 9, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTom Perriello campaign, e-mail responses, Oct, 21, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocratic Congressional Campaign Caucus, interview with Jesse F.
