Jennifer Beck says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbout 18 months after Gov. Chris Christie terminated the Access to the Region&rsquo;s Core project &mdash; better known as the ARC project &mdash; the proposal returned to the headlines last week with the release of an report on the project&rsquo;s history.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an April 11 interview on NJToday, Beck (R-Monmouth) pointed out how federal officials estimated the cost of the project, which would have linked Secaucus to a new rail station deep under West 34th Street in Manhattan, could climb to between $10 billion and $13 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The project was originally estimated to be $8.7 billion, and New Jersey alone was on the hook for all overruns,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey discovered Beck is right. Based on a federal rule for such projects, New Jersey would have been responsible for cost increases beyond the $8.7 billion budget, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeck said it didn&rsquo;t seem equitable that New York officials wouldn&rsquo;t contribute anything.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It didn&rsquo;t make sense,&quot; Beck told us. &quot;It really is a regional project.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review some of the history behind the ARC project.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith NJ Transit as the lead agency, New Jersey was to contribute $2.7 billion toward the $8.7 billion project cost. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was to contribute $3 billion, with the remaining $3 billion coming from a federal transit program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in their latest estimate before the project was canceled, federal officials said the cost could increase to between about $9.8 billion and roughly $12.4 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter Christie first announced plans to cancel the project, federal officials presented a few options to fund the remaining costs, including federal loans and a public-private partnership to secure additional funding.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut on Oct. 27, 2010, Christie went ahead with terminating what was the largest planned public works project in the nation, citing potential cost increases and the state&rsquo;s fiscal climate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDue to the project&rsquo;s cancellation, there was no final agreement on the responsibility for cost growth, according to a recent investigative report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, New Jersey would have been responsible for cost increases beyond the $8.7 billion, DOT spokesman Justin Nisly told us. Nisly said in an e-mail that &quot;it is important to note that we were actively working with NJ Transit to mitigate any potential costs when they decided to walk away from the project.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to Nisly, the basis for that responsibility is a 2006 federal rule that includes the following phrase: &quot;Once the project is approved into final design, any increase in project costs will be borne by the sponsoring agency and its non-section 5309 New Starts funding partners.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat rule goes on to say that &quot;any cost increase later in project development is the sole responsibility of the project sponsor.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an April 11 interview on NJToday, Beck claimed that beyond the $8.7 billion budget for the ARC project, &quot;New Jersey alone was on the hook for all overruns.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBased on a federal rule governing such projects, the senator&rsquo;s claim is accurate. As a DOT spokesman confirmed, New Jersey would have been responsible for cost increases beyond the $8.7 billion budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/politifact_nj_arc_tunnel_proje.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-18T16:09:04.292231", "ruling_date": "2012-04-19T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "ARC tunnel project overruns would have been New Jersey\u2019s responsibility alone, senator says", "ruling_headline_slug": "arc-tunnel-project-overruns-would-have-been-new-je", "ruling_link_text": "It was Jersey's responsibility", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNJToday, <a href=\"http://watch.njtvonline.org/video/2221981409\">Interview with state Sen.
