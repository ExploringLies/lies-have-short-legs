(We <a href=\"https://diabetesreversed.com/ptn/hkb/1?affid=82241&amp;subid=huckabeediabetes-hkb_diab_05-XX-15&amp;opz=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>sat through it </u></a>so you don&rsquo;t have to.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kit turns out to be booklets offering tips for eating, exercise, and yes, formulating dietary supplements &mdash; for the low, low price of $19.97.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We don&rsquo;t sell pills,&quot; said Barton Publishing chief marketing officer Marty Fahncke. &quot;We sell books that do, in fact, teach people how to reverse their diabetes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the video discusses at length the &quot;Double C Diabetes Remedy&quot; of cinnamon and chromium picolinate, which is described as a &quot;weird, spice, kitchen cabinet cure&quot; that &quot;will allow you to live life just like when you didn&rsquo;t have diabetes at all.&quot; Lon the narrator calls this precise combination of cinnamon and chromium picolinate a &quot;cornerstone&quot; of the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"screenshotdiabetesvideo.jpg\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/54vRi5CjVI-nGRYeyQpFKZtQhcXI8_n4iJNy9ed4Ckz7f5HS5t_tLBKvSifw-A0SM4DzFm7C2qhL-xSJnNA5stM2FR9unDo2ThpSpD4uVGaVUEFxUXSW9tYsjJKpG866EWaCpnc\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:278px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:523px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huckabee&rsquo;s campaign did not return an email seeking comment for this story. Huckabee told Schieffer that he is no longer doing the infomercials as a presidential candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Barton Publishing press release about Huckabee&rsquo;s endorsement deal says he was &quot;given just 10 years to live&quot; by a doctor who diagnosed him with Type 2 diabetes in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This contradicts Huckabee&rsquo;s own account of his diagnosis as documented by the media. According to the Associated Press, Huckabee was diagnosed with adult-onset diabetes in 2002. He lost 50 pounds within about two months after following a diet created by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. By 2004, he had lost 100 pounds through healthy eating and fitness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newspaper accounts contain no mention of a cinnamon and chromium compound helping Huckabee through, and Huckabee is careful in the video to avoid saying he followed the Diabetes Solution Kit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The closest he gets is saying the he &quot;used the same techniques to lose 110 pounds of fat, get my own blood sugar under control, and completely reverse my Type 2 diabetes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Position of diabetes associations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that&rsquo;s the diabetes solution Huckabee was being paid to promote. The question is: Do health agencies say it works?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>New York Times</em> story describes the American Diabetes Association and Canadian Diabetes Association as warning that dietary and herbal supplements &quot;are ineffective for treating diabetes,&quot; linking to a page of <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-and-care/medication/other-treatments/herbs-supplements-and-alternative-medicines/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>only the American group&rsquo;s website</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ADA&rsquo;s Diabetes.org <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-and-care/medication/other-treatments/herbs-supplements-and-alternative-medicines/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>page </u></a>is slightly more nuanced than outright calling the supplements ineffective, but nowhere does it signal support for herbal remedies: &quot;It is best to get vitamins and minerals from the foods you eat. In fact, research has not been able to prove that dietary or herbal supplements (including omega-3 supplements, cinnamon, and other herbs) help to manage diabetes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The organization cites a National Health Interview Survey that acknowledges use of herbal therapy or dietary supplements among one-fifth or one-third, respectively, of people with diabetes, especially in minority ethnic groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Canadian Diabetes Association was more straight-forward: It &quot;does not support the use of the dietary supplements advertised in these infomercials.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fahncke of Barton Publishing sent PunditFact links to various Web pages of the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/living/eatright.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</u></a>, <a href=\"http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/26/12/3215.full\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>American Diabetes Association</u></a>, <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/basics/treatment/con-20031902\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mayo</u></a> <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/expert-answers/diabetes/faq-20058472\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Clinic</u></a>, and a <a href=\"http://www.nrjournal.com/article/S0271-5317%2812%2900102-9/abstract\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>journal called Nutrition Research</u></a>. The links either talk about the importance of a healthy diet to control diabetes (and don&rsquo;t mention herbal supplements at all) or discuss small studies in China and Pakistan that showed cinnamon supplements might reduce risk factors in patients with Type 2 diabetes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, none of the links offer strong support for the cinnamon-chromium mixture recommended in the Diabetes Solution Kit &mdash; much less the endorsement of a reputable health agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other expert opinions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other endocrinologists we contacted were more blunt: The promised kitchen cabinet remedy does not work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is no scientific support for herbal treatments in the care of diabetes,&quot; said Dr. Domenico Accili, Columbia University professor medicine and director of the Columbia University Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center. &quot;The concoction of cinnamon and chromium has been sold for many years, and it&rsquo;s pure quackery.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Jeffrey Mechanick, a past president of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and attending physician in the endocrinology, diabetes and bone disease division of New York&rsquo;s Mount Sinai Hospital, said even though chromium and cinnamon are &quot;associated with salutary effects on glucose and insulin physiology in animals and in vitro,&quot; there are insufficient clinical data to back up a recommendation for the product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though consuming either the spice cinnamon or mineral chromium picolinate is inherently low risk, Mechanick said, there are several reasons to avoid the combined product, including insufficient regulation and a lack of strong science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The philosophy of using (dietary supplements and nutraceuticals) to manage diabetes instead of proven lifestyle and pharmacologic therapies is harmful,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food and Drug Administration spokesman Eric Pahon said people who &quot;rely on products which have not been reviewed by FDA for safety and efficacy&quot; &mdash; e.g. Diabetes Solution Kit&rsquo;s cinnamon and chromium picolinate recommendation &mdash; &quot;may place themselves at increased risk of poorly controlled diabetes and other risks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fournier said &quot;no health agencies support&quot; the &quot;cures and treatments&quot; that Huckabee endorsed in an infomercial promising diabetes reversal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Health groups and physicians that specialize in diabetes told us they do not support the approach to &quot;reversing diabetes&quot;
