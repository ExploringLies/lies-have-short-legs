They said it also would become the largest university in Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in a mass email to former students, the school&rsquo;s alumni association suggested the merger will put GSU in an even more exclusive class. With a student enrollment of more than 54,000, the consolidated university also will be one of the largest in the nation, the email said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Georgia decided to check the facts and the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked first at the claim that a merged Georgia State and Georgia Perimeter College would be No. 1 among the state&rsquo;s colleges and universities, based on enrollment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The University of Georgia currently holds that rank, with 35,197 students enrolled last fall, followed closely by GSU with 32,556 students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a consolidated school would have 53,927 students, if the 21,371 students who attended Georgia Perimeter last fall were put on GSU&rsquo;s rolls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That would put GSU&rsquo;s enrollment well above UGA&rsquo;s and No. 1 in the state by more than 20,000 students, based on current data. Enrollment is forecast to exceed 54,000 by 2016, assuming normal growth..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, what about that national claim?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found a couple of organizations that rank colleges and universities by enrollment. But for our purposes we had to discount the most widely known of those, U.S. News &amp; World Report. The magazine, which grades colleges and universities on several standards, bases the ranking we saw on undergraduate enrollment. Georgia State&rsquo;s claim is based on total enrollment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website Matchcollege.com identified the largest 300 colleges and universities in the U.S, -- and only 17 of them had 50,000-plus students. Several of the highest-ranking schools were largely on-line, although Ohio State University and the University of Central Florida were high on the list with 56,387 students and 59,601 students, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We discounted the schools that are largely online, including Phoenix University, with its 300,000-plus students. We did not see how to make apples-to-apples comparisons between the largely online and traditional brick and mortar colleges and universities, and a data expert we consulted agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bragging rights are also hard to determine since a lot depends on how the numbers are counted, and who is counted? We found where Central Florida calls itself the second-largest university in the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Indiana, we found that Ivy Tech College, which is the state&#39;s system of community colleges at multiple locations, is considered one college. It calls itself the nation&rsquo;s largest single accredited statewide community college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked at federal government data and went to websites to get more recent enrollment numbers. From that we found: Arizona <a href=\"https://asunews.asu.edu/20140821-asu-fall-enrollment\">State</a> University with a first-day 2014 fall enrollment topping 82,000; Lone Star <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/2014/09/25/10-universities-with-the-largest-undergraduate-student-populations\">College</a> hitting an all-time high enrollment last fall of 82,818; University of <a href=\"http://www.oir.umn.edu/student/enrollment/term/1149/current/show_all\">Minnesota</a> reported system-wide enrollment this fall of 67,477; The University of Texas at Austin in fall 2013 had 52,076 students enrolled; and Tarrant County <a href=\"http://www.tccd.edu/about_tcc/quick_facts.html\">College</a> (another community college in Texas) with a fall 2014 enrollment of 50,628.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richard Vedder, director of the not-for-profit Center for College Affordability and Productivity in Washington D.C., said he was confident that Georgia State will qualify as one of the nation&rsquo;s largest universities, once the merger is complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said it was &nbsp;&quot;a little unusual to have a two-year merge into a four-year&quot; university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Schools like Georgia State take on thousands of marginally qualified students who don&rsquo;t go on to graduate and tend to hurt their rankings. Now, they&rsquo;re going to add Georgia Perimeter students,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It might be good to save an institution. It might be a way to improve access. But I can&rsquo;t see any reputation gains from it,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vedder also cautioned that &quot;getting big doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean getting better.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hank Huckaby, chancellor of the University System, has never said the goal was to boost Georgia State&rsquo;s size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has said the merger will play to GSU&rsquo;s strength as &quot;a recognized national leader in improving student retention and graduation rates.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Combining these attributes with Georgia Perimeter College&rsquo;s leadership in providing access to students across the metro area presents a major opportunity to improve student success,&quot; Huckaby said after the merger was approved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GSU officials also have stressed that the university&rsquo;s rankings as a top-tier public research university will not be impuned and that Georgia Perimeter&rsquo;s academic enterprise will be evaluated and measured separately from Georgia State&rsquo;s bachelor&rsquo;s, master&rsquo;s and doctoral degree programs by organizations that rank institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students and faculty at GSU and Georgia Perimeter have been voicing concern about how the schools&rsquo; two missions will be blended and about staff layoffs forecast for Georgia Perimeter</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;A student earning a 4-year degree from Georgia State can expect to earn $44,200 starting out and $72,900 at mid-career, according to payscale.com. By comparison, a student with two-year degree from Georgia Perimeter can expect to make $37,200 starting out and $48,200 at mid-career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Georgia Perimeter has been without a permanent president since 2012 when President Anthony Tricoli resigned after an audit revealed a budget shortfall at the college of about $25 million. Tricoli has since filed suit, alleging he was made the fall guy and misled about the finances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Revelations about the shortfall initially hurt the college&rsquo;s credit rating. But it has since bounced back and recently been upgraded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our conclusion: The merger of Georgia State University and Georgia Perimeter College will make the state&rsquo;s largest university, as plans exist now. It also would make the combined university one of the largest in the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the alumni association&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-01-22T17:06:33.448367", "ruling_date": "2015-01-23T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Merger will produce one of nation's largest universities", "ruling_headline_slug": "merger-will-produce-one-nations-largest-universiti", "ruling_link_text": "University System trying mergers", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>GSU Alumni Association <a href=\"http://http://gsu.imodules.com/controls/email_marketing/admin/email_marketing_email_viewer.aspx?sid=1471&amp;gid=2&amp;eiid=769&amp;seiid=501&amp;usearchive=1&amp;puid=479f0524-9bde-420f-a03f-05445de2be03&amp;csid=78233\">email</a>, Jan. 13, 2015,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University System of Georgia <a href=\"http://www.usg.edu/research/documents/enrollment_reports/SER_Fall2014.pdf\">Enrollment</a> Report Fall 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campus <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_university_campuses_by_enrollment\">enrollments</a> from Wikipedia</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campus <a href=\"http://www.matchcollege.com/top-colleges\">enrollments</a> from Matchcollege.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News release: Regents Approve <a href=\"http://www.usg.edu/news/release/regents_approve_proposal_to_consolidate_georgia_state_university_and_georgi\">Proposal</a> to Consolidate Georgia State University and Georgia Perimeter College,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Charles Sutlive, vice chancellor, Office of Communications</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Andrea Jones, spokeswoman for Georgia State University</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interviews with Richard Vedder, director of The Center for College&nbsp;Affordability and Productivity, Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. News &amp; World Report, 10 <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/2014/09/25/10-universities-with-the-largest-undergraduate-student-populations\">Universities</a> with the Largest Undergraduate Student Populations, Sept.25, 2014&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lois Norder/AJC assisted in researching this fact check.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "GSU Alumni ", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3051, "last_name": "Association", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "gsu-alumni-association", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PolitiFact_silhouette_19.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3051/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p><strong>The merger of Georgia State University and Georgia Perimeter College will make GSU one of the largest universities in the nation, with more than 54,000 students.</strong></p>\r\n", "statement_context": "mass email", "statement_date": "2015-01-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
