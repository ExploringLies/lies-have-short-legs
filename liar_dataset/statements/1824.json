Separately, the Texas Public Policy Foundation has estimated that  85 percent of the state's 4-year-olds are in a public or private pre-K  program.</p>\r\n<p>The pre-K program funded by the state mostly serves  children whose families live at or near the federal poverty level &mdash; an  eligibility limit that state Sen. Rodney Ellis wants to erase in hopes,  he says, of helping more children succeed in school.</p>\r\n<p>A 2006 study  by researchers at Texas A&amp;M University concluded that permitting  all 4-year-olds to enter high-quality, full-day pre-K classes, in public  or private settings, would deliver benefits greatly exceeding costs.  The study took into account factors including educational outcomes,   increased future earnings and reduced child welfare, child care, justice  system and crime victims' costs.</p>\r\n<p>Ellis, D-Houston, filed  proposals to open pre-K to all 4-year-olds in the 2005, 2007 and 2009  legislative sessions, but nothing happened, he complains. The May 14  issue of The Texas Observer quotes Ellis saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never gotten it  out of committee or gotten a hearing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>We wondered if Ellis  accurately recapped the fate of his proposals.</p>\r\n<p>First, some  background on this issue. Like most states, Texas limits pre-K  eligibility to targeted groups. For starters, children have to be at  least 3 years old to qualify. Until recently, they also had to be  homeless or unable to speak and comprehend English or educationally  disadvantaged &mdash; a characterization based on family income.</p>\r\n<p>Since  1985, state law has required any district with at least 15 eligible  4-year-olds to offer half-day pre-K, which is supported by state  education aid. Districts that offer full-day programs must fund them by  charging parents tuition or using other resources including state  early-start grants, according to a 2010 report by the House Research  Organization. The state put nearly $777 million into pre-K classes in  2008-09, according to the Texas Education Agency.</p>\r\n<p>With an assist  from Ellis's office, we confirmed from legislative records that for  each of the three sessions, Ellis filed his pre-K bill and it failed to  win a hearing or be voted out of committee. In 2005 and 2007, identical  House measures likewise languished.</p>\r\n<p>Still, we wondered if that  inaction reflects lawmakers' indifference to early childhood education  in general, or simply the three proposals by Ellis. Has any House or  Senate member succeeded in winning consideration&mdash;or adoption&mdash;of measures  widening pre-K access?</p>\r\n<p>Texas experts on pre-K told us that in  2006 and 2007, the Legislature took steps intended to expand access.</p>\r\n<p>In  2006, legislators agreed to a move by Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San  Antonio, to allow toddler dependents of adults on active military duty  into pre-K; the expansion was rolled into a measure focused on education  and school property taxes, according to Ida Garcia, Van de Putte&rsquo;s  legislative director.</p>\r\n<p>In 2007, Garcia said, Van de Putte was  among backers of a move to ensure pre-K eligibility for all children who  had ever been in foster care became law. Previously, she said, children  in foster care were permitted into pre-K classes but if they were later  adopted, they could be barred.</p>\r\n<p>Pre-K experts noted too that  legislators last year sent Gov. Rick Perry a proposal by Rep. Diane  Patrick, R-Arlington, that directed $25 million to support full-day  pre-K classes in school districts that adopted specific pre-K class-size  limits and teacher-student ratios, among requirements. But Perry vetoed  that bill, saying the money should be spent instead on existing grants  enabling select districts to expand half-day classes to full-day  offerings -- serving \"more students with greater needs,\" or 21,000  more  students than would have been served under the vetoed proposal, the  governor said.</p>\r\n<p>So how does Ellis&rsquo; statement shake out?</p>\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s  right that his proposals to open pre-K to all 4-year-olds never drew a  hearing or advanced from committee. But a few efforts to expand  eligibility for &mdash; or enhance &mdash; pre-K offerings have succeeded or won  wide consideration.</p>\r\n<p>We rate his statement as Mostly True.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-05-24T17:47:10.745992", "ruling_date": "2010-05-24T22:09:03", "ruling_headline": "State senator thrice filed proposals to offer pre-kindergarten to all Texas 4-year-olds and thrice they stalled", "ruling_headline_slug": "state-senator-thrice-filed-proposals-offer-pre-kin", "ruling_link_text": "Sure, but lawmakers have weighed and advanced other pre-K measures", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>George  Bush School of Government and Public Service, Texas A&amp;M University,  \"A Cost-Benefit Analysis of Universally Accessible Pre-Kindergarten  Education in Texas,\" <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/05012006_universalprekstudy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">executive   summary</a>, May 1, 2006<a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/05172010_ellisofficeresponse.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/05172010_ellisofficeresponse.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">E-mail</a> and interview, response to PolitiFact Texas, Tina Tran, legislative  director/legal counsel, State Sen.
