Rick Perry again defended his foiled 2007 attempt to require Texas girls to be vaccinated against a virus that can cause cervical cancer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerry, responding to U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann&rsquo;s charge that his Feb. 2, 2007, order intended to mandate the shots for human papillomavirus, or HPV, was an inappropriate result of lobbying by his former chief of staff, said: &quot;I got lobbied on this issue. I got lobbied by a 31-year-old young lady who had stage 4 cervical cancer. I spent a lot of time with her. She came by my office, talked to me about this program.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid a cancer patient urge Perry to issue the order later nulled by Texas legislators?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNearly three weeks after Perry issued the order, it was widely reported that a Houston woman with late-stage cervical cancer had visited with him. As <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/content/region/legislature/stories/02/20/20hpv.html\">reported</a> in the Feb. 20, 2007, <em>Austin American-Statesman</em>, Heather Burcham of Houston spoke to reporters summoned by Perry as numerous legislators were indicating they would try to cancel the order.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBurcham said then: &quot;The vaccine has done its job if it saves one person from cancer, let alone knocks out cervical cancer altogether.&quot; She also signed up to testify at a Texas House hearing, the <em>Statesman</em> reported, but left before she was called to speak. Earlier in the day, she said she wanted to spend the time she had left sharing her story: &quot;It&#39;s my wildest dream come true that I get to maybe reach one person, that my life would not be in vain, that I have lived for a purpose and that I won&#39;t die and never have done anything,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFast forward.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShortly after the Sept. 22 debate, ABC News <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/09/fact-check-perry-met-dying-woman-after-hpv-vaccine-mandate/\">said</a> Perry did not meet Burcham until after he&rsquo;d issued his order. Its news article says Perry &quot;met Burcham while she was lobbying the Texas legislature to uphold the governor&rsquo;s executive order. The Legislature ultimately ruled against Burcham and Perry and did away with the vaccine mandate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe network, crediting a recent report by <a href=\"http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/in_focus&amp;id=8354519\">Houston&rsquo;s KTRK-TV</a>, said Perry and Burcham &quot;struck up a friendship despite the Texas Legislature revoking the governor&rsquo;s mandate. Perry invited Burcham to a ranch, rode motorcycles with her and even sat at her bed during her final days. Burcham died in July 2007.&quot; A pre-debate ABC News post, dated Sept. 15, 2011, specifies that Perry and Burcham struck up the friendship <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/09/hpv-vaccine-dying-woman-influenced-decision-rick-perry-now-regrets/\">after</a> he issued the order.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to a Sept. 23, 2011, <em>Houston Chronicle</em> <a href=\"http://blog.chron.com/rickperry/2011/09/perry-met-cancer-victim-lobbyist-after-signing-hpv-order/\">blog post</a>, Perry spokesman Mark Miner confirmed that Burcham met Perry when she began lobbying the lawmakers to uphold his order. The post quotes Miner saying: &quot;It was a very inspirational passionate story that he heard from her and he met with her away from the cameras and really built up a relationship with this young girl. Yes, he had (already) signed it, but it was still going through the legislative process. It had a heavy impact on him.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs <a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/09/17/3374443/perrys-friendship-with-cervical.html\">noted</a> Sept. 17, 2011, by <em>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em> columnist Bud Kennedy, Perry&rsquo;s YouTube posts include a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/GovernorPerry#p/u/6/OIsWB348z-Q\">video</a> of Burcham, in a hospital bed, shown at a May 2007 Perry press conference. Seated in a bed, Burcham says: &quot;I want to change as many people&rsquo;s lives as I can because I know there is nothing I can do for my own life, but there is something that I can do for others ... It is so important that parents get their children this vaccination.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, we interviewed Houston developer Craig Wilson, who said Burcham lived with his family off and on for about a decade before she died. Wilson said he doesn&rsquo;t recall the exact date that Burcham met Perry, though they developed a relationship when she was urging legislators not to unplug the order. &quot;He did everything he could to make her life better,&quot; Wilson said, ultimately spending three hours at her bedside before she died and later delivering a eulogy. &quot;This shows his character as a human being.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur ruling: Perry had an ally in Heather Burcham in 2007, but only after he issued his order. In the debate, in contrast, Perry brought up Burcham&rsquo;s heartfelt advocacy while not speaking to criticism he had been lobbied into the order by a former aide representing a drug company. His statement misled by creating the impression Burcham swayed him to proceed with the executive order. In reality, by all accounts, that just didn&rsquo;t happen.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Perry&rsquo;s statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-09-23T14:12:53.566619", "ruling_date": "2011-09-23T17:05:20", "ruling_headline": "Rick Perry says  he \u201cgot lobbied\u201d by a woman with late-stage cancer about vaccinating Texas girls against a virus that can cause cervical cancer", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-perry-says-he-got-lobbied-woman-late-stage-ca", "ruling_link_text": "Support came after action", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tABC News, news articles, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/09/hpv-vaccine-dying-woman-influenced-decision-rick-perry-now-regrets/\">&quot;HPV Vaccine: Rick Perry Befriended Dying Woman After Mandate,&quot;</a> Sept. 15, 2011; <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/09/fact-check-perry-met-dying-woman-after-hpv-vaccine-mandate/\">&quot;HPV Vaccine Fact Check: Perry Misstated Relationship With Dying Woman,&quot;</a> Sept. 22, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Austin American-Statesman</em>, news article, <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/content/region/legislature/stories/02/20/20hpv.html\">&quot;91 House members sponsor bill to cancel Perry&#39;s HPV mandate,&quot;</a> Feb. 20, 2007<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>The Houston Chronicle</em>, news blog post, <a href=\"http://blog.chron.com/rickperry/2011/09/perry-met-cancer-victim-lobbyist-after-signing-hpv-order/\">&quot;Perry met cancer victim &lsquo;lobbyist&rsquo; after signing HPV order,&quot;</a> Sept. 23, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Craig Wilson, Houston, Sept. 23, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 30, "current_job": "U.S. Energy Secretary", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Rick", "half_true_count": 42, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 291, "last_name": "Perry", "mostly_true_count": 24, "name_slug": "rick-perry", "pants_count": 18, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rick_Perry_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/291/", "total_count": 176, "true_count": 26, "website": "https://energy.gov/management/history/secretaries-energy"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays he &quot;got lobbied&quot; by a woman with late-stage cancer about vaccinating Texas girls against a virus that can cause cervical cancer.</p>", "statement_context": "a Republican presidential debate in Orlando.", "statement_date": "2011-09-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
