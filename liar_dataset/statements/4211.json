Bobby Scott recently urged House colleagues not to be fooled by the title of a proposed &quot;balanced budget&quot; amendment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No provision of the amendment requires a balanced budget,&quot; Scott, D-3rd, said in a July 14 letter he sent to fellow lawmakers. &quot;All debate on this bill has been on the title and not the provisions in it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA balanced budget amendment with no stipulation to balance the budget? Scott has made this claim repeatedly, so we decided to check it out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, we should point out a number of proposals for balanced budget amendments are in the pipelines. Scott directed his statement at a resolution sponsored by a fellow Virginian - U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGoodlatte&rsquo;s measure was approved by the House Judiciary Committee -- on which Scott serves -- on June 15. It calls for the president to propose a balanced budget each fiscal year. But there are two exceptions that Scott says give the resolution more holes than the Titanic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott points to language in the legislation that says, &quot;Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a roll call vote.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It doesn&rsquo;t say you need to pass a balanced budget,&quot; Scott told us over the telephone. &quot;It doesn&rsquo;t require it. It just says you need three-fifths vote to pass a budget that&rsquo;s not balanced.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Democrat also noted that the amendment would allow Congress, by simple majority votes, to waive the balanced budget requirement if the U.S. is involved in a conflict &quot;that causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott, during a June hearing, suggested that Congress could exaggerate national security risks and use them as an escape valve against balancing the budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo would Goodlatte&rsquo;s amendment require a balanced budget? For an answer to this semantic question, we first turned to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzed the bills in a June 21 letter to Lamar Smith, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn summarizing the bill&rsquo;s provision calling for the passage of a balanced budget, the CBO said &quot;such a requirement could be overridden by a three-fifths vote in each House (in Congress).&quot; In other words, the resolution does require a balanced budget but allows that stipulation to be waived.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext, we turned to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank that, along with Scott, opposes Goodlatte&rsquo;s resolution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobert Greenstein, the center&rsquo;s president, said in a July 16 statement that Goodlatte&rsquo;s amendment was one of several pending before Congress that &quot;would essentially require that the budget be balanced within the coming decade.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA June 1 letter to the House Judiciary committee, signed by 123 groups opposing Goodlatte&rsquo;s legislation, said the measure &quot;would require a balanced budget every year, regardless of the state of the economy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also talked to Bob Bixby, the executive director of the Concord Coalition, a non-partisan group that has long spoken out against federal deficits. He said balanced budget amendments typically have an &quot;escape clause&quot; to allow extra spending. He said the three-fifths vote required for additional spending under Goodlatte&rsquo;s bill is a high threshold.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The intent of Goodlatte&rsquo;s legislation is clearly to establish a balanced budget,&quot; Bixby said. &quot;You could say in a very technical sense (a balanced budget) is not required if Congress has an escape clause, but of course that&rsquo;s par for the course in a constitutional amendment.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGoodlatte&rsquo;s measure would also set an annual federal spending limit at 18 percent of the nation&rsquo;s gross domestic product and would require a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate to exceed that threshold. In addition, it would require a three-fifths vote in both houses to raise the debt ceiling.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tConstitutional amendments are extremely difficult to pass. First they require a two-thirds vote in each House of Congress. Then three-quarters of the 50 state legislatures have to approve the amendment before it could become part of the Constitution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott said that no provision in Goodlatte&rsquo;s balanced budget amendment would require balancing the budget. He makes a narrow argument based on escape valves built into the resolution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut a number of policy experts say the resolution does, first and foremost, require a balanced budget and imposes high thresholds for its exceptions. We agree and find Scott&rsquo;s semantic debate misleading. We rate his claim Mostly False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-30T15:39:08.461492", "ruling_date": "2011-08-01T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott says balanced budget amendment does not require balanced budget", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-says-balanced-budget-amendment-does-not-requ", "ruling_link_text": "Semantic argument ignores the obvious", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tU.S. Rep.
