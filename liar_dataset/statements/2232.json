(Fabian Calvo is also on the ballot.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Taxin&rsquo; Kathryn,&quot; says the mailer sent in early August 2010. &quot;With Kathryn Starkey&rsquo;s record on taxes here at home, how can we trust her -- or afford her -- in Tallahassee?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered, can you trust the mailer&rsquo;s claims? We looked at three claims, and this Truth-O-Meter item examines her actions and stance on the Penny for Pasco sales tax. Other items are <a href=\"http://cms.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/aug/13/committee-protect-florida/kathryn-starkey-missed-just-over-half-meetings/\">here </a>on her attendance at river board meetings and <a href=\"http://cms.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/aug/13/committee-protect-florida/group-raps-kathryn-starkey-aiding-and-abetting-tax/\">here </a>on her actions involving votes on river board tax rates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe tax hike in question is the Penny for Pasco sales tax, a one-cent-on-the-dollar county sales tax increase to build new schools and roads, preserve land and buy public safety equipment. About 52 percent of voters approved the tax in March 2004. By the end of 2009, the extra penny had pulled in about $205 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim that Starkey &quot;joined forces with liberal Democrats&quot; to pass the tax has problems.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, Starkey played no strong public role in selling the tax to voters. She publicly endorsed the Penny for Pasco during her successful 2004 campaign for School Board, but she never actively campaigned for it or joined the committee promoting it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecond, where were the liberal Democrats? Pasco&rsquo;s Citizen Committee, the political action committee that formed to promote the tax, had 14 key volunteers: 10 of them were registered Republicans, the Pasco Times reported then.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey included well-known Republicans Allen Altman, Joanne Hurley, Thad Lowery and Bill Phillips.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTrue, the tax got the endorsement of Pasco&rsquo;s Democratic Executive Committee and not that of the county&rsquo;s Republican Executive Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut consider, too, the prominent Republican politicians who publicly supported the tax: Commissioners Ted Schrader, Ann Hildebrand and Pat Mulieri and then-commissioner Steve Simon, along with then-state representatives Ken Littlefield and Heather Fiorentino.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd don&rsquo;t forget Pasco Sheriff Bob White, another Republican, who was quoted in the Pasco Times calling support of the tax a &quot;no-brainer.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhite said then that his remarks were aimed primarily at how the tax would help the school district, but his endorsement &mdash; however nuanced &mdash; was political gold for the tax&rsquo;s backers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne big selling point for Republicans: The sales tax would result in a property tax reduction on the school district side. (Incidentally, that is not unlike Corcoran&rsquo;s platform in the House 45 campaign to eliminate property taxes and increase the sales tax.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be sure, there were Democrats who were very involved in the effort. They included Land O&rsquo;Lakes lawyer Tim Hayes and, most visibly, Ray Gadd, who led the school system&rsquo;s effort as a Pasco school district administrator at the time. Then-commissioner Peter Altman, a Democrat, was also a vocal supporter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I can&rsquo;t think of a liberal Democrat who was involved,&quot; said Gadd, who, incidentally, has changed his affiliation to independent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe strongest opponents of the tax included Republicans Bill and Ann Bunting, leaders in the local party. But even they acknowledge that they were more often fighting people with Rs, not Ds, after their names.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I can&rsquo;t for the life of me understand how those Republicans supported it,&quot; said Ann Bunting.<br />\r\n\tPennington, Corcoran&rsquo;s consultant, said he linked Starkey with the Penny leaders because her endorsement as a School Board candidate carried weight. He said he also thought Allen Altman, who helped spearhead the campaign, was a Democrat. (Wrong.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCorcoran was equally mistaken that the tax was a strongly Democratic initiative. &quot;It was overwhelmingly pushed by Democratic leaders,&quot; he said. (He was also unaware that White &mdash; whom he now works for as a contract attorney &mdash; endorsed the Penny.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA new tax may be often associated with &quot;liberal Democrats,&quot; but that wasn&rsquo;t the case with Penny for Pasco, particularly when it came to those who were publicly pushing for it. In addition, Starkey was not a key promoter of the tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim False.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-13T19:26:19.309176", "ruling_date": "2010-08-13T19:18:47", "ruling_headline": "\"Taxin' Kathryn\" Starkey draws fire over 2004 local sales tax", "ruling_headline_slug": "taxin-kathryn-starkey-draws-fire-over-2004-local-s", "ruling_link_text": "Republicans led the Pasco sales tax drive", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tInterview,&nbsp;Ray Gadd, week of Aug. 1, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview, Allen Altman, week of Aug. 1, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview, Thad Lowery, week of Aug. 1, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview, Ann Bunting, week of Aug. 1, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview, Richard Corcoran, week of Aug. 1, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview, Rockie Pennington, week of Aug. 1, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview,&nbsp;Rockie Pennington, week of Aug. 9, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview, Kathryn Starkey, week of Aug. 9, 2010.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 594, "last_name": "Committee to Protect Florida", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "committee-protect-florida", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mugs_mug-independentgroup_____________________.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/594/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tKathryn Starkey &quot;joined forces with liberal Democrats on a historic sales tax hike.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in a mailer", "statement_date": "2010-08-02", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 5, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/5/", "subject": "Environment", "subject_slug": "environment", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Kathryn", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 593, "last_name": "Starkey", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "kathryn-starkey", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": null, "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/593/", "total_count": 0, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": ""}
