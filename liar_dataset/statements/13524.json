She also said Wisconsin uses illegal voting machines, which we rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/29/jill-stein/seeking-recount-donald-trump-win-jill-stein-says-w/\">Pants on Fire</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We noted in that item that the vast majority of voting machines in Wisconsin are optical readers. Voters fill out a paper ballot and feed it into the machine, which then electronically records the vote. Meanwhile, a small percentage of votes are cast on touch-screen machines -- but in Wisconsin they also generate a paper record for each ballot cast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of early afternoon on Dec. 9, 2016, with the recount <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/12/09/judge-wisconsin-recount-go-forward/95197438/\">expected to be completed</a> within two or three days, 88.5 percent of the Wisconsin votes had been recounted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton had <a href=\"http://elections.wi.gov/node/4756\">gained 49 votes</a> on Republican <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>, who won the state by some 22,000 votes in the original count. All told, there was a <a href=\"http://elections.wi.gov/node/4756\">net change of 1,322 votes</a> in the presidential race among the more than 2.63 million ballots that had been recounted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for how the recounting has been done, the majority of Wisconsin&rsquo;s 72 counties (including Dane, but not Milwaukee) are doing it by hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is what the <a href=\"http://elections.wi.gov/node/4481\">county election clerks told</a> the Wisconsin Election Commission at the outset of the recount about their plans for the recount:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>47 counties: Recount by hand<br />\r\n13 counties: Combination of hand count and optical scanners<br />\r\n12 counties: Optical scanners</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A word on the process in Wisconsin:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Every ballot is first examined by the recount workers so the candidates&rsquo; representatives can see it and raise any questions or objections to it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>If the recount is conducted by hand, the ballots are sorted into piles for each candidate for counting by hand.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>If the recount is by machine, the ballots are fed into the tabulating machine for counting.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The commission told us it did not follow up with the clerks to see if any of their plans had changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there were <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/12/07/recount-update-expected/95087708/\">news</a> <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/11/30/presidential-recount-underway-wisconsin/94680814/\">reports</a> about hand counts being done in various counties, including Brown, Clark and Marinette.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, Duffy was not claiming that Dane was the only county doing hand recounts, according to Duffy spokesman Mark Bednar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duffy &quot;was explaining that Dane County was the only county where there were reports on the ground of Stein supporters trying to slow-walk the recount process,&quot; Bednar said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s not how it came out in the interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duffy declared that only Dane County was hand counting votes. But many counties decided to do the recount by hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;slow walking&quot; part of what Duffy said has to do with Stein and Clinton supporters and nothing to do with Dane County.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duffy said Wisconsin has only one county, Dane, &quot;that&#39;s hand counting the votes&quot; in the 2016 presidential recount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But several dozen counties committed to doing recounts by hand, Dane being one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b3f85e86-7ccc-4ba0-92e7-7491472043c2\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b3f85e86-7ccc-4ba0-92e7-7491472043c2</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-12-09T16:18:55.995261", "ruling_date": "2016-12-09T18:01:11", "ruling_headline": "In the Wisconsin presidential election recount, is only Dane County doing the recount by hand?", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-presidential-election-recount-only-dane-", "ruling_link_text": "Dane County one of many", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v55Fq6FoXA\">video clip</a> of Sean Duffy interview, posted Dec. 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Sean Duffy spokesman Mark Bednar, Dec. 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/29/jill-stein/seeking-recount-donald-trump-win-jill-stein-says-w/\">&quot;Wisconsin uses voting machines that are outlawed, they are illegal,&quot;</a> Nov. 29, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/12/09/judge-wisconsin-recount-go-forward/95197438/\">&quot;Judge: Wisconsin recount will go forward,&quot;</a> Dec. 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Election Commission, <a href=\"http://elections.wi.gov/node/4756\">recount update</a>, Dec. 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Election Commission,<a href=\"http://elections.wi.gov/node/4481\"> recount methods</a>, Dec. 1, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Wisconsin Election Commission public information officer Reid Magney, Dec. 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Mark Pocan spokesman David Kolovson, Dec. 9, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "Member of the U.S. House", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Sean", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 653, "last_name": "Duffy", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "sean-duffy", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Duffy_Sean.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/653/", "total_count": 24, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://duffy.house.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>Wisconsin has only one county, Dane, &quot;that&#39;s hand counting the votes&quot; in the 2016 presidential recount.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview", "statement_date": "2016-12-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 209, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/209/", "subject": "County Government", "subject_slug": "county-government", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "In the Wisconsin presidential #2016election recount, is only Dane County doing the recount by hand?
