The <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/historical/goods.pdf\">trade deficit</a> in 2015 for just goods was $763 billion. Not quite $800 billion, but reasonably close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason the overall trade deficit is smaller than just the goods trade deficit is because the United States exports more services than it imports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the highest the goods trade deficit has ever been. It ranged from $782 billion in 2005 to $832 billion in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible, however, that current figures actually understate the size of the goods trade deficit because oil prices have been abnormally low, said Robert Scott, director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank supported in part by unions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s a large deficit,&quot; Scott said. &quot;And it needs to be reduced.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly &hellip; $800 billion last year alone.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, the goods trade deficit was $763 billion.
