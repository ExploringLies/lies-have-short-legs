We decided to check out one found on his campaign&rsquo;s Facebook page, in which he claims that the federal government &quot;mandates transexuals (sic) and homosexuals grabbing children in their stranger-danger zones in the name of airport security.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Clayton for some supporting documentation or evidence for this assertion and he responded by sending a Public Advocate of the United States press release. It contains the statement of Eugene Delgaudio, president of Public Advocate, under the headline, &quot;We were right all along: Perverse court allows TSA male agent to grope women.&quot; The statement begins: &quot;The TSA&rsquo;s mix of ultra-leftist hiring practices along with their intrusive &lsquo;security&rsquo; procedures of pornographic scanners and groping is leading to disaster.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe suggested to Clayton that the assertions by Delgaudio, a Loudoun County, Va., supervisor and fervent anti-gay-rights advocate, did not support his statement factually, but we received no further response. We took note that the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks right-wing extremist groups, has labeled Public Advocate a &quot;hate&quot; group. The Democratic party has disavowed Clayton&rsquo;s candidacy, has tried to keep him off the ballot and has suggested voters write in an alternative.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we decided to look at the case that Delgaudio made involving a transgender employee named Ashley Yang who worked for the TSA in Los Angeles. Yang dressed as a woman and took hormone therapy to look like a woman. Yang was fired after complaining of discrimination, sued and received five months&rsquo; back pay and other compensation in a negotiated settlement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom what we can find <a href=\"http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/08/08/transgender-tsa-agent-forced-to-pat-down-men-wins-settlement/\">from legitimate sources</a>, the Yang case does not involve &quot;transexuals (sic) or homosexuals grabbing children in their stranger-danger zones,&quot; nor even transsexuals doing so. It does involve employment law regarding the on-the-job treatment involving gender identity, and a voluntary settlement in which one party was a federal government agency.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBending over backwards to try to make Delgaudio&rsquo;s statement somehow support Clayton&rsquo;s claim, we nonetheless note Delgaudio is alleging that Yang was groping women, not children. There is a difference, even if the allegation itself is dubious.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDelgaudio also made a statement that &quot;when I see men with wigs and dresses lining up to work as TSA screeners, or little boys crying because a strange man is violating their bodies, I know that I can&rsquo;t possibly be on the wrong path.&quot; Absent reports that such things are happening, that does not pass for evidence.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNonetheless, we sought out a response to the claim from the TSA. Jonathan Allen, a TSA spokesman, responded to our inquiry with the following statement: &quot;While fulfilling a critical and necessary security mission, we are conscious of individual concerns of passengers and strive to conduct the screening process with dignity and respect.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllen also sent along TSA policy <a href=\"http://www.tsa.gov/assets/pdf/civil_rights_policy.pdf\">statements on Civil Rights,</a> the <a href=\"http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/children/index.shtm\">screening of children</a> and on <a href=\"http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/pat_downs.shtm\">&quot;pat downs.&quot;</a> The policy regarding children reads in part: &quot;Security officers will approach children gently and treat them with respect. If a child becomes uncomfortable or upset, security officers will consult parents about the best way to relieve the child&#39;s concern.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur ruling<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state Democratic Party&rsquo;s disavowal of Clayton is but one indication of his lack of credibility. This kind of baseless statement is yet another. The TSA does not mandate that any of its screeners &quot;grope&quot; children in any &quot;zone.&quot; Clayton is making a ridiculous, reckless claim, and for that we give this statement a Pants On Fire!</b></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-12T23:02:34.122328", "ruling_date": "2012-08-13T04:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Disavowed Democratic Senate primary winner claims TSA makes non-straight employees grab children", "ruling_headline_slug": "disavowed-democratic-senate-primary-winner-claims-", "ruling_link_text": "No such policy", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.5826722434721887\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; font-weight: normal; \">Mark Clayton Facebook campaign website statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAug. 7, 2012, Email message from Mark Clayton to Bartholomew Sullivan, transmitting this hyperlink and parenthetical disclaimer: &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;<a href=\"http://publicadvocateusa.org/news/article.php?article=7007\">http://publicadvocateusa.org/news/article.php?article=7007</a> &nbsp;as well as linked article (PA not affiliated with any political campaign for public office).&quot; The email message ends: &quot;This is not a formal statement of any kind.
