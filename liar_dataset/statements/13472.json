The university, which <a href=\"http://www.txhighereddata.org/Interactive/Accountability/UNIV_Complete_PDF.cfm?FICE=003565\">enrolled about 12,300 students in fall 2015</a>,&nbsp;is in Hunt County, which Trump carried with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://enrpages.sos.state.tx.us/public/nov08_319_county115.htm\">76 percent of the vote to Clinton&rsquo;s 20 percent</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And according to I Am A Texan, the letter offered counseling services to students with election-related stress, &quot;outlining all the ways that the university was prepared to help its fragile students who can&rsquo;t bear the thought of living now that Donald Trump has won the election.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Administrator: No intent to focus on fears of Trump</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And did the university spell out ways for students to deal with fears of Trump?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get a fix on that, we reached out to Tom&aacute;s Aguirre, the university&#39;s assistant vice president and dean of students; Aguirre&rsquo;s digital signature was stamped on the email that included the attached letter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, Aguirre confirmed the authenticity of the posted email, which was blank save this subject line: &quot;An Open Letter to Students: How to De-Stress from Election.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aguirre also insisted there was no administration intent to focus on students fearful of the president-elect, who was not mentioned in the letter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Miller spokesman bemoans student &#39;wusses&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also emailed Miller&rsquo;s office, and got a phone call in response from spokesman Todd Smith, who said, &quot;Who else would they be offering emotional counseling to if not people opposed to Donald Trump being president?&quot; Smith&rsquo;s point: Trump fans would have been happy--not in need of counseling--after election day. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Commissioner Miller believes that the mere fact that college students need counseling after a presidential election is a sad commentary on the state of our nation and many of its young people,&quot; Smith said. &quot;Commissioner Miller thinks they&rsquo;re a bunch of wusses.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>University&#39;s letter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So exactly what offer did the university make?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, Aguirre sent us a copy of the original &quot;open letter,&quot; pictured below, which he said was emailed to students on Nov. 10, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iQC0pRSB7bXRnJiAMMMiqwiLzEac4THqCnesDq0Z0ttiGWdzQis2-E-VbElI3Mq1SDfap1BxNUSSWzeBP3rfweTAME7Bz1VLID_5lqZuDUe6tEAvHckndbx-TdeXkuqXJJgUQ_uV\" style=\"border-style:solid; border-width:1px; float:left; height:500px; margin:2px 0px; width:600px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The letter doesn&rsquo;t mention Trump or any candidate by name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It opens by calling the national election cycle &quot;a particularly stressful one.&quot; Next, it says the Counseling Center staff &quot;wants to acknowledge a range of reactions you might be experiencing Including excitement, joy, relief, fear, sadness, anger, dread, hopelessness, anxiety, and numbness.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The letter&rsquo;s second paragraph opens: &quot;We are here to listen and support you as our nation works through this election transition.&quot; It goes on to offer services especially to students &quot;struggling with the impact of the election or the tone of the national discussion&quot; and students who have experienced negative treatment because of &quot;race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious affiliation, country of origin or other aspects of your identity.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The letter closes with tips for students at &quot;this highly emotional time for our nation&quot; to remain productive. That comes after a sentence stating the center &quot;provides a safe space for discussions on identity, empowerment, intercultural competency, and the impact of the election.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, Aguirre described the letter as a reminder of services available year-round. Also, he said, it was similar to letters distributed to students through the school year such as at mid-term exams and around Valentine&rsquo;s Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aguirre said he put the letter in motion after the election because the school&rsquo;s Counseling Center had seen an uptick in student visits during the fall 2016 semester. Aguirre said, though, that he he didn&rsquo;t know if the spike related to the election; confidentiality constraints bar the university from saying why students seek counseling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A student&#39;s comment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if students saw eye to eye with Aguirre regarding the undertones of the open letter. So we messaged the Facebook page for the College Republicans at Texas A&amp;M University - Commerce, and got a response from Michael Faz, the group&rsquo;s vice president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faz, a senior majoring in political science, said by phone that Aguirre &quot;sends those emails out all the time,&quot; up to a few times a month. Faz said he read the letter himself but doubted that most students did. The College Republicans on campus, Faz said, did not feel the reminder of support services was a message catered to students fearful of Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We didn&rsquo;t think anything of it,&quot; Faz said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miller posted an article saying Texas A&amp;M University - Commerce was offering counseling and &quot;safe spaces for students who are afraid of President-elect Trump.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the election, the university sent a letter to students describing its counseling center as a &quot;safe space.&quot; Yet that letter didn&rsquo;t specifically mention Trump while offering services for students experiencing varied reactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Miller&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>HALF TRUE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
