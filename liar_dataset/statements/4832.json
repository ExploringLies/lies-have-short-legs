But the decision is in the hands of Congress. The law permits Congress to come up with equal cost reductions of its own, or vote to disregard the recommendations outright by a three-fifths majority.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The IPAB is specifically forbidden from making any recommendations that would ration care, reduce benefits, raise premiums or cost-sharing or alter eligibility for Medicare,&quot; HHS Secretary <a href=\"http://republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/Media/file/Hearings/Health/071311/Sebelius.pdf\">Kathleen Sebelius </a><a href=\"http://republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/Media/file/Hearings/Health/071311/Sebelius.pdf\">told</a> the House Energy and Commerce Committee this July. &quot;And all final decisions remain in the hands of Congress. If Medicare costs are rising at an unsustainable rate, it&rsquo;s Congress&rsquo;s choice whether to accept those recommendations or come up with recommendations of its own to put Medicare spending on a stable, sustainable path.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitFact Ohio was puzzled by the ad&rsquo;s comparison of IPAB to the Internal Revenue Service. IPAB is a 15-member board that&rsquo;s supposed to suggest ways to reduce growth in Medicare spending. IRS is a mammoth government agency that collects taxes, enforces the tax laws set by Congress, and helps taxpayers understand and comply with those laws. So we asked 60 Plus spokesman Gerry Scimeca to explain the similarities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScimeca said that both groups are intimidating bureaucracies that operate in secret and make decisions that dramatically affect the lives of average Americans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;IPAB will unilaterally render a sentence affecting all seniors on Medicare, impacting what remedies are available to seniors in need of health care, and giving bureaucrats immense power over available remedies and their costs,&quot; Scimeca said in an email. &quot;Like the IRS, IPAB will operate in secret, will have vast powers to reach into our lives, and will have the final, irrefutable say on Medicare policy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that description simply is not accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe IPAB appointments will be done in public. Members will be chosen by the president, with confirmation from the Senate. It would not have the power to issue edicts. Rather, it can only make recommendations. That those findings can be overruled by Congress hardly makes its rulings &quot;unilateral&quot; or &quot;final,&quot; as Scimeca says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe functions of IRS and IPAB are entirely unrelated. Some taxpayers may consider the IRS to be scary and 60 Plus may be scared by IPAB. But that does not make IPAB board a &quot;Medicare IRS.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the late 1950s, Elvis Presley, whose repertoire included the hit &quot;Burning Love,&quot; eclipsed Boone in popularity.
