Several of them,&quot; said Greco, who was elected to four terms as mayor, serving 1967 to 1974 and 1995 to 2003.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt Monday&#39;s event, he waved a 75-page booklet that details accomplishments in every city department during his last two terms in office, signaling that its contents will form the basis for his campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile it&#39;s loaded with information, a statement in the Revenue and Finance Department section on page 56 jumped out at us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGreco said he &quot;refinanced $232.6 million in bonds resulting in reduced debt service for the City.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered: Could a mayor known for his free-spending ways on huge projects have actually lowered the city&#39;s debt payments?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCity budget documents show that multiple bonds totalling $232.6 million were indeed refinanced during Greco&#39;s tenure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey are:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull; A $45.6 million water and sewer bond issued in 1988 and refinanced in 1998.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; A $52 million utility tax bond issued in 1991 and refinanced in 2001.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; A $66.1 million water and sewer bond issued in 1999 and refinanced in 2001.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; A total of $31.2 million from a sewer state revolving loan fund refinanced into 2002 water and sewer bonds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; A $37.7 million water and sewer bond issued in 1992 and refinanced in 2002.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&#39;s true that refinancing those bonds resulted in lower debt payments &mdash; by at least $21 million &mdash; over several decades.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the statement in Greco&#39;s booklet, by itself, could lead someone to believe that the city&#39;s total debt went down during his tenure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s not the case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, Tampa&#39;s total debt payments in 1995 were $62.5 million and climbed to $80.2 million in 2002. The city&#39;s total debt increased from $682 million to more than $1 billion during that time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong the $480.6 million in bonds that contributed to that increased debt:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; $23.6 million issued in 1996 for police headquarters, district offices and fire rescue vehicles<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; $62.8 issued in 1999 million to renovate the Hillsborough River water treatment plant<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; $19.2 million issued in 1998 for an Ybor parking garage and parking lots<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; $190.5 million issued in 1999 to upgrade the city&#39;s waste-to-energy facility and construct a new administration building<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; $24.8 million issued in 1999 for the electric streetcar and other transportation projects<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; $55.6 million issued in 2001 for an art museum, Lowry Park Zoo expansion and other projects<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen asked about the statement, Greco said he doesn&rsquo;t believe it suggests any broad message about the city&#39;s total debt payments, and it refers only to specific bonds that were refinanced.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe notes that the status report on the Revenue and Finance Department also details the issuing of new bonds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This sentence puts in context that new bonds were being issued, in addition to bonds that were being refinanced,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAdding that all up, we find Greco correctly described the bonds that were refinanced during his years as mayor.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut taken in isolation, the statement about the lowered debt payments for Tampa is misleading.
