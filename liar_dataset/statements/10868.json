Ron Johnson, who defeated him in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The big word came May 14, 2015, when Feingold released <a href=\"http://www.russfeingold.com/\">a 90-second video</a> saying he was in the race. Knowing that Feingold is teaching a course at Stanford University in California, the National Republican Senatorial Committee pounced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not long after Feingold tweeted his announcement, the NRSC issued this retort:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In what may be the oddest move of the campaign season thus far, Stanford Professor and failed 2010 candidate Russ Feingold announced his Wisconsin Senate run today from &hellip; California.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The line of criticism was repeated throughout the day, including by conservative <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SykesCharlie/status/598994675567964160\">talk show host Charlie Sykes</a> and on his <a href=\"http://www.rightwisconsin.com/dailytakes/Russ-Feingolds-Very-Weird-Announcement-303825861.html\">Right Wisconsin website</a>. More recently, it was picked up by Gov. Scott Walker, when he said Feingold &quot;announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate while he was still in California.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the NRSC has continued to press the idea <a href=\"http://www.nrsc.org/blog/russ-feingold-announces-from-california?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_campaign=20150514_nrsc-p-feingold-announces_twitter&amp;utm_content=nrsc\">on its website</a>, with a map that circles California (&quot;where Feingold announced&quot;) and Wisconsin (&quot;where he&rsquo;s running.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So did Russ Feingold&rsquo;s attempt at a Wisconsin comeback really begin in the Golden State?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prof. Feingold</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his 2010 defeat after 18 years in Washington, Feingold has taught classes at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis., Marquette University in Milwaukee and twice at Stanford. He also held a temporary assignment for 18 months as the U.S. State Department envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa. He left that post earlier this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His<a href=\"https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&amp;filter-coursestatus-Active=on&amp;page=0&amp;catalog=&amp;academicYear=&amp;q=feingold&amp;collapse=#\"> current Stanford class</a> is called &quot;Implications of Post-1994 Conflicts in Great Lakes Region of Africa: an American Perspective.&quot; The course, offered to graduate and law school students, runs from March 30 to June 3, meeting from 4:15 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. on Wednesdays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked NRSC communications director Andrea Bozek for evidence to support the group&rsquo;s claim that Feingold announced his new campaign from California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her response: &quot;If he was at class Wednesday night, how did he get back by 9:15 in the morning&quot; on Thursday for an announcement?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked if the group had proof that Feingold was in California at the time of the announcement, she responded: &quot;I think the onus is on Sen. Feingold to prove that he was in the state when this video went out.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The announcement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we take a closer look at Feingold&rsquo;s day, we should note that his campaign announcement video was made in the living room of the house he has owned for years in Middleton, Wis. That home -- and its garage door on which Feingold once painted campaign promises -- has factored prominently in his previous campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 2010 campaign, WISN-AM radio talk show host Mark Belling claimed that Feingold faked an ad to make it appear that he was standing outside the house. We rated the claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/29/mark-belling/mark-belling-says-sen-russ-feingold-faked-his-tv-a/\">Pants on Fire</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/newswatch/104100704.html\">Belling later backtracked</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what about Feingold&rsquo;s whereabouts on May 14?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A look at his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/russfeingold\">Twitter </a>and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/russfeingold\">Facebook</a> accounts provides solid evidence that he was in Wisconsin that day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An <a href=\"https://twitter.com/russfeingold/status/598898196027416576\">entry posted at 11:10 a.m. on Twitter</a> includes a picture of Feingold sitting on a patio, talking on the phone. The message reads: &quot;At home in Middleton. Excited to travel Wisconsin, meet with folks, and kick off our campaign. -RDF&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day goes on from there with pictures of visits to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/russfeingold/status/598970616687951872\">the Mocha Moment Coffee House in Janesville</a>, and a<a href=\"https://twitter.com/russfeingold/status/599009138987773952\"> stop for a beer at the Memorial Union Rathskeller</a> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, other tweets suggest Feingold has been back and forth while teaching the Stanford class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/russfeingold/status/576848321290993664\">March 21, 2015 tweet</a> read: &quot;At home today prepping for my class at Stanford. Took a break in beautiful Pheasant Branch Creek in Middleton.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bozek said Republicans would continue to emphasize Feingold&rsquo;s out of state job and have assigned a &quot;tracker&quot; to follow Feingold when he is in California. On May 21, 2015, they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwh-hMcj50I&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4s\">posted and tweeted videos of Feingold</a> walking to his class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you want to represent Wisconsin families you need to dedicate your time to listening to their concerns, rather than meeting with donors in California, &quot; Bozek said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how did Feingold teach his Stanford class and yet make it back to Wisconsin for the big day? His campaign said the answer was pretty simple: a red eye flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold took United Airlines flight 995 from San Francisco to Chicago. The flight left at about 11:45 p.m. Wednesday and arrived in Chicago at about 5:44 a.m. Thursday morning, said Russ for Wisconsin campaign manager Tom Russell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold was picked up at the airport and back in the Badger State when his latest quest began, his campaign said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Republican Senatorial Committee said that Russ Feingold announced his campaign for Senate while in California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But tweets and other evidence shows he was in Wisconsin at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-05-22T12:15:57.386975", "ruling_date": "2015-05-22T14:06:33", "ruling_headline": "Did Russ Feingold announce his U.S. Senate comeback from California, instead of Wisconsin?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-russ-feingold-announce-his-us-senate-comback-c", "ruling_link_text": "Actually, he was in Wisconsin", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>National Republican Senatorial Committee <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NRSC\">Twitter account</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nrsc.org/blog/russ-feingold-announces-from-california?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_campaign=20150514_nrsc-p-feingold-announces_twitter&amp;utm_content=nrsc\">National Republican Senatorial Committee website</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone interview, Andrea Bozek, National Republican Senatorial Committee, &nbsp;May 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russ Feingold <a href=\"https://twitter.com/russfeingold\">Twitter account</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russ Feingold campaign <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/russfeingold\">Facebook account</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.russfeingold.com/\">Russfeingold.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails, Max Croes, Democratic Party of Wisconsin, May 20, 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&amp;filter-coursestatus-Active=on&amp;page=0&amp;catalog=&amp;academicYear=&amp;q=feingold&amp;collapse=#\">Stanford University course bulletin</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.rightwisconsin.com/dailytakes/Russ-Feingolds-Very-Weird-Announcement-303825861.html\">&quot;Russ Feingold&rsquo;s very weird announcement,&quot; </a>May 14, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.united.com/web/en-US/default.aspx?root=1\">United Airlines website</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/russ-feingold-announces-rematch-senate-bid-against-ron-johnson-in-2016-b99500378z1-303742291.html\">&quot;Russ Feingold announces rematch Senate bid against Ron Johnson in 2016,&quot;</a> May 14, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WISC-TV, Channel 3000.com, <a href=\"http://www.channel3000.com/news/gov-walker-discusses-israel-trip-defends-travel/33063638\">&quot;Gov.
