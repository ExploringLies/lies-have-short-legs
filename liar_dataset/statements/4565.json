The 102-year-old Madison magazine <a href=\"http://www.progressive.org/about\">calls </a><a href=\"http://www.progressive.org/about\">itself</a> &quot;one of the leading voices for peace and social justice in this country.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Cardin asked Rothschild why younger people are leading the demonstrations, he said: &quot;The unemployment rate for people between the ages of 16 and 24 in this country is 18.4 percent, which is a 60-year high.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs the rate for younger workers that high?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnemployment has been a major issue since the start of the recession in December 2007 -- and not just for people in their late teens and early 20s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe U.S. Department of Labor <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/ils/pdf/opbils81.pdf\">reported</a>, for example, that in December 2009, unemployment reached a record 7.2 percent among people ages 55 and over and that people in that age group spent an average of 35 weeks out of work -- considerably more than the average of 23 weeks for unemployed people ages 16 to 24.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn making his claim about younger workers, Rothschild told us he was quoting an April 2011 <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/page/-/BriefingPaper306.pdf\">report</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/\">Economic Policy Institute</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt said: &quot;In 2010, the unemployment rate for workers age 16-24 was 18.4 percent &mdash; the worst on record in the 60 years that this data has been tracked.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, although Rothschild said the current rate of unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 is at a 60-year high, he was referring to the annual rate for 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Economic Policy Institute is a liberal-leaning Washington, D.C. think tank that <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/about/\">says</a> it seeks to &quot;broaden discussions about economic policy to include the needs of low- and middle-income workers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIts report -- which urges &quot;substantial additional stimulus spending&quot; by the federal government to create jobs for younger workers -- says the unemployment statistics came from the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/\">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. The bureau is the federal government&rsquo;s statistics keeper on unemployment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe queried the Bureau of Labor Statistics&rsquo; database to create a <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/BLSdata.xls\">chart</a> showing the monthly and annual unemployment rates for people ages 16 to 24 from 1948 through August 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found that the Economic Policy Institute report was correct: Unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 was 18.4 percent in 2010; and that rate is higher than any annual rate dating back to when statistics were first kept in 1948. That&rsquo;s more than 60 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe next-highest annual rates, each exceeding 17 percent, were posted in 1982, 1983 and 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn each of the first eight months of 2011, however, the rate has been below the 2010 mark of 18.4 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnemployment among people ages 16 to 24 was 17.7 percent in August 2011, the most recent month for which statistics are available. And the year-to-date average is 17.6 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the rate is lower today than it was for 2010 as a whole, though only eight months of 2011 are accounted for. We don&rsquo;t know, of course, how the year will end up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRothschild said unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 &quot;is 18.4 percent, which is a 60-year high.&quot; The 18.4 percent is correct as the average rate for 2010, and that average annual rate is the highest in more than 60 years. More recent figures, however, show the unemployment rate among people ages 16 to 24 has dipped below 18 percent in 2011, at least through August.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Rothschild&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-07T12:55:05.974156", "ruling_date": "2011-10-10T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Progressive magazine editor says young worker unemployment at \"60-year high\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "progressive-magazine-editor-says-young-worker-unem", "ruling_link_text": "It's fallen a bit since 2010 number", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWisconsin Public Radio, <a href=\"http://www.progressive.org/list/mattrothschild\">Matthew </a><a href=\"http://www.progressive.org/list/mattrothschild\">Rothschild </a><a href=\"http://podcast.wpr.org/jca/jca111004b.mp3\">interview</a>, Oct. 4, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, The Progressive editor and publisher <a href=\"http://www.progressive.org/list/mattrothschild\">Matthew Rothschild</a>, Oct. 5, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEconomic Policy Institute, &quot;The Class of 2011&quot;
