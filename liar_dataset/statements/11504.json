John Kasich talked about bringing down college costs, prompting Jeb Bush to chime in about the low cost of tuition in Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We don&#39;t need the federal government to be involved in this, because when they do, we create a $1.2 trillion debt,&quot; said the former Florida governor during the Oct. 28 debate in Boulder, Colo. &quot;In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there&#39;s accountability, just as John (Kasich) said. You&#39;ll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won&#39;t indebt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to know: Does Florida hold the No. 1 spot for lowest in-state college tuition?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Comparison of in-state tuition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush spokesman Matt Gorman said that when <a href=\"http://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-fees-sector-state-time\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bush left office in 2007</u></a>, Florida had the lowest in-state tuition for a public four-year university among the 50 states. The data from the College Board bears that out: It was $3,881 for a four-year public university in 2006-07.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But during the debate, Bush didn&rsquo;t say he was referring to when he ended his tenure as governor &mdash; he made it sound like he was talking in the present tense, so we looked at that data, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The College Board publishes an annual <a href=\"http://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/2014-15-in-state-tuition-fees-public-four-year-state-five-year-percentage-change\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>comparison</u></a> of in-state tuition and fees at four-year public universities nationwide, comprised of survey data from almost 4,000 postsecondary institutions. The comparison refers to average price paid by a full-time student for one year of undergraduate enrollment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For 2014-15, the lowest was Wyoming at $4,646, followed by Arkansas at $6,138; Utah at $6,177; New Mexico at $6,190; Montana at $6,279, and then Florida at $6,351. So Florida was the sixth-lowest, although four of the states were only between $72 and $213 cheaper than Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Florida is one of the most affordable states for public university tuition,&quot; said Ralph Aiello, who supervises college counselors for Broward County public schools in Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The College Board produces a similar report comparing tuition for <a href=\"http://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/2014-15-in-state-tuition-fees-public-four-year-state-five-year-percentage-change\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>two-year degrees</u></a> which showed that Florida was again on the low end but not at the cheapest spot in 2014-15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are a number of reasons for the wide variation in published tuition and fees by state &mdash; state tuition philosophy, aid policy, economic conditions, and funding for higher education,&quot; said Jennifer Ma, the College Board&rsquo;s policy research scientist. &quot;For example, New Hampshire, which has the highest published tuition and fees for the public four-year sector in 2014-15, does not have a state grant aid program and has the lowest state appropriations on a per-student basis.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush specifically mentioned &quot;tuition,&quot; but we&rsquo;ll note that there are a lot of factors than influence the ultimate price tag for students, including fees, scholarships, financial aid and room and board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush said, &quot;In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not accurate if we look at 2014-15 tuition for four-year public universities compiled by the College Board. That data shows Wyoming had the lowest tuition followed by Arkansas, Utah, New Mexico, Montana and Florida. Florida was the sixth-lowest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush&rsquo;s campaign said he was referring to Florida&rsquo;s ranking as the lowest in 2006-07 when he left office, but he didn&rsquo;t specify that timeframe during the debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-29T16:07:25.951135", "ruling_date": "2015-10-30T10:55:00", "ruling_headline": "Jeb Bush says that Florida has cheapest public college tuition", "ruling_headline_slug": "jeb-bush-says-florida-has-cheapest-public-college-", "ruling_link_text": "Cheap but not the cheapest", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CNBC, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7KOD6S5ipo\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Debate clip</u></a>, Oct. 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>College Board, <a href=\"http://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/2014-15-in-state-tuition-fees-public-four-year-state-five-year-percentage-change\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>In-state tuition and fees</u></a>, 2014-15</p>\r\n\r\n<p>College Board, <a href=\"https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/misc/trends/2014-trends-college-pricing-report-final.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Trends in college pricing</u></a>, 2014-15</p>\r\n\r\n<p>College Board, <a href=\"http://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-fees-sector-state-time\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Tuition and fees by sector over time</u></a>, 2006-07</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/14/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-tweets-florida-got-f-college-affor/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Hillary Clinton tweets that Florida got an F in college affordability under Jeb Bush,&quot; </u></a>Aug. 14, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/jun/30/florida-democratic-party/florida-dems-say-tuition-went-482-percent-jeb-bush/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Florida Dems say tuition went up 48.2 percent under Jeb Bush,&quot;</u></a> June 30, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Matt Gorman, Jeb Bush spokesman, Oct. 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview Jos&eacute; Rios, College Board staff member, Oct. 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Ralph Aiello, Supervisor School Counseling, BRACE, &amp; Academic Advisement Department of College and Career Readiness at Broward County public schools, Oct. 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Cheryl Etters, Florida Department of Education spokeswoman, Oct. 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Brittany Davis, Florida Board of Governors spokesman, Oct. 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 18, "current_job": "", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Jeb", "half_true_count": 17, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 436, "last_name": "Bush", "mostly_true_count": 24, "name_slug": "jeb-bush", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Jeb_Bush.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/436/", "total_count": 80, "true_count": 14, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "the CNBC GOP presidential debate", "statement_date": "2015-10-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
