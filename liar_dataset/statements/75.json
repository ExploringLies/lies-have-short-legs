The proposal goes on to show how that cost would be paid for with savings from other changes to the health care system.\n<p>\n There's no way to verify the $110-billion figure, but those off-setting savings? They're pretty optimistic, which is why we rate this claim as half-true.\n</p>\n<p>\n Much of the savings would come from \"discontinuing\" the 2001 tax cuts to households with incomes over $250,000 per year, which are scheduled to expire in 2010. Clinton, like most Democrats, has proposed letting those high-income tax cuts expire, which the Congressional Budget Office says would generate $52-billion in tax revenues.\n</p>\n<p>\n Over half of the $110-billion would come from such things as saving $10-billion by phasing out excessive Medicare payments to HMOs and other managed care plans.\n</p>\n<p>\n While it is true that the $10-billion in overpayments to Medicare HMOs exists in the system, so far the Senate has not agreed to such cuts. Whether Congress under a Clinton presidency would agree to slash reimbursements to a powerful private insurance lobby is yet to be seen.\n</p>\n<p>\n The plan also estimates that $35-billion could be saved by \"modernizing the health system\" by encouraging health care providers to adopt cost-saving information technology programs and better management of chronic diseases such as diabetes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Clinton's policy expert said the figure is a very conservative estimate and multiple studies suggest the actual figure will be much higher. The Clinton campaign cited a 2005 Rand Corp. study that put the potential savings at $77-billion per year.\n</p>\n<p>\n But that study is not without critics.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. David Himmelstein and Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, practicing physicians as well as professors at Harvard Medical School, criticized the Rand study, noting that it was funded by a technology company.\r\nAt the time, the two physicians wrote in\n <i>\n  Health Affairs\n </i>\n , \"For decades, vendors have capitalized on this enthusiasm. But hospitals and clinics have ended up with little to show for their large outlays.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Himmelstein said Tuesday that promises of big savings through information technology is \"pure vaporware.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n \"And though there's some evidence that disease management improves care, there's no evidence it saves money,\" he said. \"People getting in to see their doctors means more cost, not less.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:37.188633", "ruling_date": "2007-09-18T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Optimistic math", "ruling_headline_slug": "optimistic-math", "ruling_link_text": "Optimistic math", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/78xx/doc7821/02-23-BudgetOptions.pdf\">\n Congressional Budget Office, Budget Options, Feb. 2007\n</a>\n<p>\n Perspective; Hope And Hype: Predicting The Impact Of Electronic Medical Records, September-October 2005, David U.
