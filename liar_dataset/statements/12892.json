He is the founder of ISIS, okay? He is the founder. He founded ISIS. And I would say the cofounder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has been making <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2599110\">similar comments for several months</a>, and he repeated his latest talking point in an interview with Republican radio host <a href=\"http://www.hughhewitt.com/donald-trump-makes-return-visit/\">Hugh Hewitt</a> the day after his Broward speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, when Hewitt proposed a more cautious interpretation of his assertion &mdash; that Obama and Clinton &quot;created the vacuum&quot; in the region and thus &quot;lost the peace&quot; to ISIS &mdash; Trump rejected that formulation, sticking with the most literal version of &quot;founder&quot; and &quot;co-founder.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No, I meant he&rsquo;s the founder of ISIS,&quot; Trump told Hewitt. &quot;I do. He was the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her, too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hewitt pushed back, saying, &quot;But he&rsquo;s not sympathetic to them. He hates them. He&rsquo;s trying to kill them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump dismissed that again, saying, &quot;I don&rsquo;t care. He was the founder. The way he got out of Iraq was, that, that was the founding of ISIS, okay?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And hours after the Hewitt interview aired, Trump tripled down on the attack in a speech to the National Association of Homebuilders in Miami Beach once again accusing them of being the founder and cofounder of ISIS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/jul/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-blames-hillary-clinton-creati/\">already incorrect</a> when he said Clinton &quot;invented&quot; ISIS with her &quot;stupid policies,&quot; as he did a few weeks ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now he&rsquo;s taking it a step further with the &quot;co-founded&quot; attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us be clear: It is wildly inaccurate to say Obama or Clinton &quot;co-founded&quot; ISIS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The creation of ISIS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts have repeatedly told us that the sources of ISIS are complex and interconnected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Trump&rsquo;s provocative comment glosses over all of that nuance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/may/28/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-isis-didnt-exist-when-my-brother-was/\">terrorist group&rsquo;s roots</a> pre-date Obama&rsquo;s presidency and Clinton&rsquo;s role as secretary of state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ISIS has used several names since 2004, when long-time Sunni extremist Abu Mus&lsquo;ab al-Zarqawi established al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and more recently the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), according to the <a href=\"http://www.nctc.gov/site/groups/aqi.html\">National Counterterrorism Center</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After he was killed in a 2006 U.S. airstrike, the group became the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, the group was referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and then just the Islamic State in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most prominent leader of the group we now call ISIS has been Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who became the leader in&nbsp;2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democrats often blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, because al-Qaida flourished after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you could also argue Obama&rsquo;s decision to leave Iraq after 2011 contributed to the security vacuum that gave ISIS the chance to put down roots and regroup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump campaign sent us links to articles about how the Obama administration handled the situation in the Middle East that influenced the rise of ISIS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Clinton, Trump&rsquo;s campaign has previously pointed to her <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/may/12/jeb-bush-hillary-clinton-and-authorizing-war-iraq/\">vote as a senator to authorize force</a> in Iraq in 2002. She later said she regretted that vote. While Clinton does bear some responsibility for the Iraq war that gave ISIS an opening, she isn&rsquo;t solely responsible:&nbsp;The vast <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00237\">majority of senators</a> &mdash; from both parties &mdash; joined her in supporting the intervention advocated by Bush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So yes, Hillary&#39;s vote for President Bush&#39;s misguided policy to build democracy in Iraq directly assisted the Republican decision that opened the door to the radicalization of Iraq and destabilization of the Levant,&quot; said Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma told us in July when Trump attacked Clinton. &quot;Bush&#39;s destruction of the Iraq Army and state is the single-most important decision that led to the expansion of al-Qaida into the region and later emergence of ISIS.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/18/jeb-bush/obama-refused-sign-plan-place-leave-10000-troops-i/\">Republicans</a> have blamed Obama for not keeping 10,000 troops in place in Iraq, which they say could have deterred the opening for ISIS. However, Obama inherited a timeline to exit Iraq from Bush, and that did not include an agreement to leave a large force behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s campaign has also pointed to Clinton&rsquo;s positions on Syria and Libya as evidence for allowing ISIS to grow. As secretary of state in 2011, she echoed Obama&rsquo;s support for regime change in Syria and said Assad needed to &quot;get out of the way.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Clinton&#39;s enthusiasm for regime change in Libya in 2011, which Obama endorsed, resulted in the collapse of order there, which ISIS and others have exploited,&quot; Christopher Preble, a defense expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, previously told PolitiFact. &quot;That is a fair criticism, in my opinion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, the United States has <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/a/obama-to-discuss-islamic-state-fight-with-national-security-council/3208052.html\">targeted</a> ISIS <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/05/politics/obama-isis-military-meeting/\">militarily</a>, with some signs of progress and some setbacks. After an ISIS terrorist attack in Brussels, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/23/barack-obama-destroying-isis-top-priority-brussels-attacks\">Obama said</a> that destroying the group is his &quot;top priority.&quot; (For what it&rsquo;s worth, Clinton herself was in favor of supporting <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-history-with-arming-syrian-rebels/\">Syrian rebels</a> but was overruled by Obama. She also advocated for maintaining a moderate <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/18/hillary-clinton-pushed-obama-to-keep-troops-in-iraq.html\">troop presence in Iraq</a> after 2011.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Hewitt suggested in the interview, it&rsquo;s possible to argue that the administration&rsquo;s withdrawing from Iraq, its lack of support to anti-Assad rebels in Syria and its decision to intervene in Libya contributed to the power of ISIS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These concerns track those we&rsquo;ve heard from foreign-policy experts. However, this more limited and defensible critique of Clinton&rsquo;s record is what Hewitt offered Trump on his radio show, and the candidate forcefully rejected it out of hand \u007f&mdash; twice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said Obama &quot;founded ISIS. I would say the cofounder would be crooked Hillary Clinton.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a credible critique that Obama&rsquo;s and Clinton&rsquo;s foreign-policy and military decisions helped create a space in which ISIS could operate and expand. But Trump explicitly rejected this formulation, saying he literally means Obama is &quot;the founder of ISIS&quot; and Clinton is the &quot;cofounder.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, the founder of ISIS was a terrorist. It is run by terrorists. Obama has said destroying ISIS is his &quot;top priority.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this makes Trump&rsquo;s statement a ridiculous characterization. He&rsquo;s doubled, tripled and quadrupled down on it in various venues and has reinforced that he meant his words to be taken literally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-11T12:56:30.841899", "ruling_date": "2016-08-11T14:07:25", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that Barack Obama 'founded' ISIS, Hillary Clinton was 'cofounder'", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-pants-fire-claim-obama-founded-isis-c", "ruling_link_text": "He flatly rejected a more plausible critique", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Miami Herald</em>, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/donald-trump/article94967637.html\">&quot;Trump riffs to rowdy crowd in Broward,&quot; </a>Aug. 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo3wvqk8kvM\">Donald Trump speech in Sunrise, Florida</a>, Aug. 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hugh Hewitt, <a href=\"http://www.hughhewitt.com/donald-trump-makes-return-visit/\">&quot;Donald Trump makes a return visit,&quot;</a> Aug. 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Examiner</em>, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2599110\">&quot;Media see new controversy in something Trump said 7 months ago,&quot;</a> Aug. 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Chicago Tribune</em>, <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-obama-isis-founder-20160811-story.html\">&quot;Trump accuses President Obama of being the &#39;founder of ISIS,&#39;&quot; </a>Aug. 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/world/middleeast/leaving-iraq-us-fears-new-surge-of-qaeda-terror.html?_r=3\">Leaving Iraq, U.S. Fears New Surge of Qaeda Terror</a>,&quot; Nov. 5, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS News, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-history-with-arming-syrian-rebels/\">&quot;Hillary Clinton still wouldn&#39;t give up on training Syrian rebels,&quot; </a>Sept. 22, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daily Beast, <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/18/hillary-clinton-pushed-obama-to-keep-troops-in-iraq.html\">&quot;Hillary Clinton Pushed Obama to Keep Troops in Iraq,&quot;</a> June 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post </em>The Fix<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/11/donald-trumps-obama-founded-isis-comment-exemplifies-why-his-campaign-is-on-the-brink-of-doom/\">, &quot;Trump&rsquo;s &lsquo;Obama founded ISIS&rsquo; comment exemplifies why his campaign is on the brink of doom,&quot;</a> Aug. 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-was-secretary-is/\">&quot;Donald Trump says before Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State &#39;ISIS was not even on the map,&rsquo;&quot;</a> July 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>60 Minutes</em>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peESph-KVzE\">Donald Trump and Mike Pence interview</a>, July 17, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump press release, &quot;Hillary&rsquo;s foreign policy: a before and after look at the world,&quot; July 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump press release, &quot;Clinton&rsquo;s reckless invasion of Libya, and the terror haven she left behind,&quot; July 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald Trump,<a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-on-the-stakes-of-the-election\"> Speech</a>, June 22, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/04/opinions/bergen-trump-obama-clinton-creation-of-isis/\">&quot;Did Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton create ISIS?&quot; </a>Jan. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kixXoLuNC4Q\">U.S. Rep.
