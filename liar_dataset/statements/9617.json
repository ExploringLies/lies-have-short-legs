Rick Scott, launching a TV ad campaign and pulling no punches in interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one freewheeling discussion with the <em>Tampa Bay Times</em> editorial board July 16, 2014, former Gov. Crist attacked Scott&rsquo;s education spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can only imagine how nice it would be to serve as governor when you have a surplus of almost $3 billion. That&rsquo;s what this guy has right now,&quot; Crist said. &quot;And in spite of it, he still hasn&rsquo;t matched what I did during the recession for per-pupil funding for kids. In fact, he&rsquo;s about $200 less.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida has done many checks on claims about school spending by these two candidates, but we wanted to know if Scott really budgeted $200 less per student than Crist. Good thing both governors have permanent records for us to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Budget crunch</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a quick overview, the Florida Education Finance Program is the main source of dollars for K-12 education. By law, it&rsquo;s a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars, called the &quot;required local effort,&quot; in an amount dictated by the state. In recent years, the state has also received federal stimulus dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott has been touting the $18.9 billion K-12 education spending budget he signed this year as the largest in state history. We rated that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/jan/29/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-his-k-12-education-budget-proposal/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Half True</u></a>, because it was the largest in terms of dollars spent, but not after inflation and not per pupil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we break down the most recent budget, it works out to $6,937 in spending per pupil. Even though the budget is higher, Florida schools now have a higher enrollment, roughly 90,000 more than in 2007, according to state projections at the start of the 2014-15 school year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crist has been contending that his per-pupil spending has been higher, referring to the $7,126 per student allocated in his&nbsp;$18.7 billion education budget for 2007-08. That works out to an $189 difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But considering both governors&rsquo; terms as a whole, there&rsquo;s more to the story. Education budgets declined during Crist&rsquo;s administration, with a corresponding drop in per-pupil spending, save for a slight bounce his last year in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott, meanwhile, came into office looking to slash $3.3 billion out of the education budget, resulting in a $700 per pupil cut. But lawmakers balked. He settled for knocking $1.3 billion out of the budget, dropping per-student dollars by $540, due in part to a loss in <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/816261-fefp-funding-history.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>federal stimulus money</u></a> that had been shoring up spending for Crist&rsquo;s last two budgets.

In 2008, education funding dropped to less than what the 2014 budget now offers.

If they did, that 2007-08 number would equal $8,176 in 2014 dollars, $1,200 more than what is currently budgeted per student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even at the lowest spending during Crist&rsquo;s tenure in 2009-10, the inflation-adjusted total in state and local funding would be around $7,209, still a higher value than Scott&rsquo;s last budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crist said Scott&rsquo;s per-pupil education spending is &quot;about $200 less&quot; than the Crist administration did during the recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott&rsquo;s current budget does spend almost $200 less per student than Crist did in 2007, but that was before the recession really hit. Spending was less during the other three years of Crist&rsquo;s term -- although still higher than some of Scott&rsquo;s years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Scott cut school funding when he came into office, but has gradually increased it to a level that&rsquo;s currently higher than what Crist signed off on during the Great Recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you account for inflation, though, Crist&rsquo;s per-pupil spending outpaces Scott&rsquo;s for every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-07-17T17:23:21.937472", "ruling_date": "2014-07-18T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rick Scott's student spending is 'about $200 less' than during recession, Charlie Crist says", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-scotts-student-spending-about-200-less-during", "ruling_link_text": "That figure wasn't during the recession", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview with Charlie Crist, July 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/jan/29/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-his-k-12-education-budget-proposal/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Rick Scott says his K-12 education budget proposal is highest in Florida&#39;s history</u></a>,&quot; Jan. 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/mar/27/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-rick-scott-tried-slash-school-f/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Charlie Crist says &#39;Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion&#39;</u></a>,&quot; March 27, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Miami Herald</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/06/02/4153294/florida-gov-rick-scott-expected.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Gov.
