She gave herself a 40 percent pay raise. Charged us for a police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party. But the worst part? Frankel spent over $13,000 in taxpayer money on a marble shower in a private bathroom with her own toilet. What a waste. &quot;All that money right down the drain for her own personal use,&quot; says the narrator, who is revealed to be sitting on a toilet.&quot;When you gotta go, you gotta go but that&rsquo;s just ridiculous.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claims in the ad are similar to an ad by the<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/sep/28/yg-action-fund/super-pac-attacks-lois-frankel-over-pay-raise-jobs/\"> YG Action Fund</a>, a conservative PAC which showed Frankel&rsquo;s headshot inside a cartoon image of a helicopter flying near a mansion with balloons falling from the sky. We fact-checked a claim by the PAC that Frankel got a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/sep/28/yg-action-fund/super-pac-attacks-lois-frankel-over-pay-raise-jobs/\">40 percent pay rais</a>e while the city of West Palm Beach lost jobs. We rated that claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/sep/28/yg-action-fund/super-pac-attacks-lois-frankel-over-pay-raise-jobs/\">Half True</a> because the pay raise was correct but the ad failed to accurately explain the jobs picture. We also looked at whether Frankel spent money on<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/oct/25/adam-hasner/lois-frankels-mayoral-bathroom-takes-hit-adam-hasn/\"> a marble shower</a>. We rated that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/oct/25/adam-hasner/lois-frankels-mayoral-bathroom-takes-hit-adam-hasn/\">Half True</a> as well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this fact-check we will focus on Hasner&rsquo;s claim that Frankel took a ride in the city&rsquo;s helicopter to go to a dinner party. We aren&rsquo;t weighing in on whether it was a good decision by Frankel to take that ride -- our role is to evaluate whether Hasner accurately portrayed it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHasner and Frankel, both former state legislators who have each raised just shy of $3 million, are competing in the Broward/Palm Beach <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2012/oct/03/fact-checking-frankel-hasner-race-browardpalm-beac/\">Congressional District 22</a>. Frankel was mayor of West Palm Beach between 2003 and 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Helicopter ride featured in gossip column</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad cites an April 2005 <em>Palm Beach Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/482711-adam-hasner-gotta-go-sources-1.html\">article</a> by gossip columnist Jose Lambiet. (He now writes a column for the <em>Miami Herald</em>, a PolitiFact Florida partner.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe article didn&rsquo;t state the date of the helicopter ride but said &quot;earlier this year&quot; Frankel&rsquo;s aide drove her during rush hour to a homeowner&rsquo;s association meeting, where she said she was there &quot;just to shake hands.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbout an hour later, a police chopper landed on the community&rsquo;s golf course and Frankel was taken to a party downtown. The columnist described it as an affair thrown by &quot;Clematis-area merchants ticked off about - you guessed it - roadwork.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What sounds like a party to you is work for me,&quot; Frankel said at the time. &quot;I called in the helicopter with clear instructions that, if there was a public safety emergency, they wouldn&#39;t need to come. I don&#39;t make a habit of this.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I did see all the cars stuck down there. I was thinking: &#39;Maybe I should do this more often,&#39; &quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLambiet wrote that Police Chief Delsa Bush didn&#39;t know about the mayor&rsquo;s ride but said, &quot;The mayor&#39;s the boss, and she&#39;s welcome to use the chopper. &hellip; The county commissioners have police escorts. Why can&#39;t the mayor?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Frankel interview with PolitiFact</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we interviewed Frankel, she said that she never took a city helicopter to a <em>personal</em>&nbsp; party -- it was a work party.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrankel said around Christmas she went to a community party on one edge of the city but was also scheduled to host a party hosted by the city&rsquo;s Downtown Development Authority the same night.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It was one of those things -- I was supposed to be at two places at one time,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Frankel if she used the police helicopter to get to any other events. She said &quot;Maybe one other time from a work event to another work event. I didn&rsquo;t go up that often. I am pretty claustrophobic, hydrophobic.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe noticed that Frankel said the helicopter ride occurred around Christmas time, but Lambiet&rsquo;s column -- which simply said &quot;earlier this year&quot; -- was written April 3. Lambiet told us in an interview that he thought that the chopper ride was a few days before his column was published.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe exact date of the ride wasn&rsquo;t crucial to rule on Hasner&rsquo;s claim but we thought it was important to try to pin down exactly which party Frankel had attended.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrankel&rsquo;s campaign supplied us with two <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/483928-frankels-dda-event-dec-22-2004.html\">calendar entries </a>for the mayor on Dec. 22, 2004. The first one states &quot;5 p.m. Sharp! Ibis Tropical Cheers&quot; and states that the event would end at six.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe other calendar entry states that from 6 to 8 p.m., Frankel would host a holiday party at Wine Living and includes a contact phone number for the Downtown Development Authority. (Wine Living has since closed.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe calendar entries don&rsquo;t specifically discuss the police helicopter. However, both calendar entries state &quot;required to Arthur Apicella&quot; in the police department. Frankel&rsquo;s campaign says that Apicella was in charge of the helicopter at the time and has since retired. Our efforts to reach Apicella were unsuccessful.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe interviewed Art Bullard, Frankel&rsquo;s executive assistant at the time, who drove her to the event in Ibis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That particular event, it was important enough that she made the decision to take the helicopter,&quot; Bullard said. &quot;It wasn&rsquo;t an everyday procedure. I think it happened maybe once or twice.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHasner&rsquo;s ad says that while she was mayor of West Palm Beach, Frankel took a &quot;police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Frankel says she never took the helicopter to get to a private party -- only in her duties as mayor. Public records we found appear to support that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad left open to interpretation whether that was a private party or a mayoral event. So for making that unclear we rate this ad Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-25T09:53:04.669381", "ruling_date": "2012-10-25T14:15:15", "ruling_headline": "Adam Hasner says Lois Frankel used a police chopper to get to dinner party", "ruling_headline_slug": "adam-hasner-says-lois-frankel-used-police-chopper-", "ruling_link_text": "This claim has been flying around for years", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/sep/28/yg-action-fund/super-pac-attacks-lois-frankel-over-pay-raise-jobs/\">&quot;Super PAC attacks Lois Frankel over pay raise, jobs record,&quot;</a> April 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2012/oct/03/fact-checking-frankel-hasner-race-browardpalm-beac/\">&quot;Fact-checking the Frankel-Hasner race in South Florida,&quot;</a> Oct. 3, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYouTube, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qAYbJaapbI\">Adam Hasner Gotta-go ad</a>, Oct. 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAdam Hasner campaign, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/482711-adam-hasner-gotta-go-sources-1.html\">News articles in Nexis about Lois Frankel including &quot;Frankel hops police chopper for party,&quot;
