Staples, pitching for listeners to <a href=\"http://protectyourhomeandland.com/sign-the-petition\">sign an online petition</a> urging the 2011 Legislature to embrace &quot;true eminent-domain reforms,&quot; told KVET-FM morning hosts Bob Cole and Bucky Godbolt: &quot;What we&#39;re talking about is a basic constitutional right of property owners. Our United States Constitution says that if eminent domain has to be used, a property owner must be justly compensated, period.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Bill of Rights says pay up? Get out (that&#39;s just an expression).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe actual language doesn&#39;t say &quot;must,&quot; but the meaning aligns with Staples&#39; comment. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution says no private property shall &quot;be taken for public use, without just compensation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNationally, Staples is among figures to air frets about the power of government to &quot;take&quot; property for declared public&nbsp; purposes, in part reacting a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court decision, in Kelo v. City of New London,&nbsp;upholding a community&#39;s right to take property for an economic redevelopment project; the plaintiff had maintained the city&#39;s plan for her land did not constitute &quot;public use&quot; under the Fifth Amendment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to an April 2009 article in the American Bar Association&#39;s <i>Journal</i>, 43 states enacted statutes or constitutional amendments restricting the use of eminent domain in the wake of the court ruling, while at least five state supreme courts issued rulings to &quot;significantly impede government power to take private property.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Texas, the federal ruling contributed to the 2009 Legislature proposing a state constitutional amendment which voters adopted last year. The amendment prohibits the taking of private property for transfer to a private entity for the purpose of economic development or to increase tax revenues, according to the Texas Secretary of State&#39;s office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGilbert has questioned Staples&#39; bonafides for talking up laws against government taking private property without just compensation. In a Sept. 17 press release, the Democrat singles out measures Staples supported as a state senator to suggest he&#39;s not always aligned with private property owners.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat sally may be valid; we&#39;re not judging it here. We rate Staples&#39; statement to KVET as True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-24T12:44:27.314361", "ruling_date": "2010-09-28T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Todd Staples says U.S. Constitution provides for just compensation when government takes land", "ruling_headline_slug": "todd-staples-says-us-constitution-provides", "ruling_link_text": "It's in the Bill of Rights.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAmerican Bar Association Journal, article, <a href=\"http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/wheres_the_revolution/\" id=\"lmuf\" title=\"Article\">&quot;Where&#39;s the Revolution?&quot;</a> April 1, 2009 (accessed Sept. 24, 2010)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHank Gilbert campaign, press release, &quot;<a href=\"http://hankgilbert.com/2010/09/gilbert-to-staples-stop-being-a-hypocrite-quit-lying-and-own-up-to-your-record/\">Gilbert to Staples: Stop Being A Hypocrite, Quit Lying, And Own Up to Your Record,&quot;</a> Sept. 17, 2010 (accessed Sept. 21, 2010)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKVET-FM, Austin, audio of interview of Texas Agriculture Commissoner Todd Staples, Sept. 16, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTexas Secretary of State, website, <a href=\"http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/voter/2009novballotexp.shtml\">&quot;Explanatory Statements for the November 3rd, 2009 Constitutional Amendment Election,&quot;</a> (accessed Sept. 21, 2010)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Constitution Online, website, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Am5\">Amendment 5 - Trial and Punishment, Compensation for Taking&quot;</a> (accessed Sept. 21, 2010)</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "state agriculture commissioner", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Todd", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 290, "last_name": "Staples", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "todd-staples", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/staples.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/290/", "total_count": 12, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.toddstaples.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays the U.S. Constitution provides for just compensation when land is taken under eminent domain.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a radio interview.", "statement_date": "2010-09-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 42, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/42/", "subject": "History", "subject_slug": "history", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 157, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/157/", "subject": "Message Machine 2010", "subject_slug": "message-machine", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 108, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/108/", "subject": "Supreme Court", "subject_slug": "supreme-court", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
