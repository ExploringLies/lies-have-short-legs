A majority has said that nearly every time the poll has been conducted -- 10 times since 1992. Only in December 2001 did more respondents (49 percent) say they were confident about their children&rsquo;s future than were not confident (42 percent).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/life.htm\">A similar poll</a> conducted for CBS News and the <em>New York Times</em> in April asked 957 adults, &quot;Do you think the future of the next generation of Americans will be better, worse, or about the same as life today?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe &quot;worse&quot; answer had a plurality: 47 percent. Twenty-four percent answered &quot;better&quot; and 23 percent said &quot;about the same.&quot; That poll, conducted six times since 2009, also reflected widespread pessimism, with &quot;worse&quot; being the most frequent answer every time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, a<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/155021/majority-dissatisfied-next-generation-prospects.aspx\"><em>USA Today</em>/Gallup poll</a> of 1,012 adults conducted in May surveyed whether Americans are satisfied with &quot;the opportunity for the next generation of Americans to live better than their parents.&quot; Nearly six in 10 Americans -- 58 percent -- said they were dissatisfied, while 40 percent said they were satisfied.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney said that &quot;the majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found three polls that support his claim. Americans are indeed pessimistic about their children&rsquo;s prospects. But that&rsquo;s nothing new, according to the NBC News/<em>Wall Street Journal</em> poll. For at least the last 20 years, Americans have expected that our kids would be worse off than we are. Romney cast this national outlook as specifically an Obama-era phenomenon.
