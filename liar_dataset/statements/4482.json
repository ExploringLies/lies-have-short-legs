Michele Bachmann of Minnesota for president says Gov. Rick Perry leads a state in fiscal dire straits. In an advertisement targeting South Carolina voters, the narrator says: &quot;This year, Rick Perry is spending more money than the state takes in, covering his deficits with record borrowing.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTalk about news; is Texas state government in the red?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome perspective: Texas is a &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; state that, unlike the federal government, cannot borrow money to balance its operating budget. About 45 states have constitutional provisions requiring their budgets to balance, as we noted in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/dec/25/john-cornyn/sen-john-cornyn-says-49-states-have-balanced-budge/\">December 2010 fact check</a>. The Texas Constitution <a href=\"http://law.justia.com/constitution/texas/sections/cn000300-0049a0.html\">says</a> that barring a four-fifths vote of the Legislature, lawmakers may not spend more than the cash and projected revenue that the state comptroller certifies as available for appropriation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis June, State Comptroller Susan Combs certified the state would have sufficient revenue to fund the 2012-13 state budget that lawmakers sent to Perry, the Austin American-Statesman <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/politics/entries/2011/06/08/comptroller_certifies_budget.html?cxntfid=blogs_postcards\">then reported.</a> Perry signed the budget into law that month.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo how is Texas in the hole?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Keep Conservatives United super PAC traces its ad claim to an Aug. 23, 2011, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903461304576526681067671982.html\">news article </a>which says the state&rsquo;s sale that day of $9.8 billion in tax-exempt general obligation tax and revenue anticipation notes, set to mature Aug. 30, 2012, was the largest sale of short-term notes since the state started selling short-term notes in 1987.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Such notes typically mature within one year,&quot; the story says, &quot;and are generally issued by states at the start of their fiscal years to raise cash ahead of incoming tax and revenue receivables for that year.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe story quotes the Texas state comptroller&#39;s office saying the notes mainly would be used to support payments to public schools at the beginning of the school year, but also to avoid a temporary cash shortfall in unrestricted accounts in the state&#39;s general-revenue fund and so the state could manage its cash flow spending through &nbsp;the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the story, the comptroller projected a maximum temporary cash shortfall of $13.2 billion within fiscal 2012 without the note proceeds and other available borrowing. The state said it expects to start fiscal 2012 with a $1.8 billion negative cash balance in the general revenue fund&#39;s unrestricted accounts, and to end the 2012 fiscal year with a negative cash balance of $6.7 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, those figures are in the comptroller&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.trantexas.com/pma/Texas.TRAN.2011.pos/TRAN.2011.POS.pdf\">offering document</a> describing its intended sale of the notes. But there&rsquo;s more information, too, indicating the state won&rsquo;t be in the hole once all funds are taken into account.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe offering document says the notes &quot;currently projects that the maximum temporary cash shortfall within fiscal year 2012 will be $13.2 billion before application of note proceeds and other available interfund and intrafund borrowing.&quot; And, the document says, while the Legislature approved a balanced budget, the state &quot;expects to begin fiscal year 2012 on Sept. 1, 2011, with a negative cash balance in the unrestricted accounts in the General Revenue Fund of $1.8 billion. The General Revenue Fund is expected to end fiscal year 2012 with a negative cash balance of $6.7 billion in the unrestricted accounts.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLater, the document says the state&rsquo;s general revenue kitty has &quot;historically been subject to a temporary cash shortfall during each fiscal year because taxes and other revenues are received more slowly than expenditures are paid through the first eight months of the fiscal year.&quot; Hence, the document says, the need for the short-term notes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the state made a record sale of short-term notes and predicted a cash shortfall during the fiscal year, which ends Aug. 31, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs that the same as running a budget deficit?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Combs, Billy Hamilton, the state&rsquo;s former deputy comptroller, and Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, for their views.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCombs&rsquo; spokesman R.J. DeSilva replied by email that annual sales of Tax and Revenue Anticipation Notes aren&rsquo;t designed to cover deficits. Instead, he said, they help the state maintain cash-flow. Looking ahead, he said, if there&rsquo;s insufficient revenue to fulfill state obligations at the end of this fiscal year, the gap will be handled in the next year&rsquo;s sale of notes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHamilton told us it&rsquo;s been state practice since the late 1980s to sell the short-term notes to smooth out payments &mdash; such as those to school districts &mdash; over months that state tax revenue isn&rsquo;t accumulating fast enough to immediately cover expenses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCraymer, previously a budget adviser to two governors, said by email that the pro-Bachmann group&rsquo;s claim, based on the comptroller&#39;s projection of revenues and spending for the year ending Aug. 31, 2012, overlooks the reality that Texas legislators approve two-year budgets &mdash; and the latest budget balances through August 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAugust 2012, then, is the &quot;mid-point of our budget, not the end point,&quot; Craymer said. &quot;It&#39;s kind of like criticizing someone who gets paid at the end of each month because they spend more than they take in during the first half of the month.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCraymer added that the tax-anticipation notes sold by the state are &quot;commonly used by states and other government entities to cover spending and revenue timing gaps within the budget. They are short-term notes paid off before the end of each fiscal year, and cannot be used to finance any deficit (in Texas or any other state).&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCraymer said in an interview: &quot;Washington has real debt. The states have to balance their budgets. There&rsquo;s no logical connection between short-term cash borrowing and a (budget) defict. That&rsquo;s a stretch.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur ruling is that while the state undertook record short-term borrowing, the state is not in the red by any stretch of that characterization. The two-year budget adopted by lawmakers and signed into law by Perry was required to balance--and there&rsquo;s no indication that it no longer does. The ad&rsquo;s statement--casting the sale of short-term notes as covering Perry&rsquo;s deficits--misrepresents a routine annual sale.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis is worse than incorrect. It&rsquo;s ridiculous.
