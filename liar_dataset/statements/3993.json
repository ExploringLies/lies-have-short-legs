Bob McDonnell&rsquo;s stance on funding for sex education programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong the claims: &quot;$400,000 -- approximate cost to Virginians to fund ineffective abstinence-only-until-marriage programs. $2.5 million -- federal funding for comprehensive sex education programs Virginia lost due to McDonnell&rsquo;s political agenda.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAre NARAL&rsquo;s numbers and claims correct? We asked Tarina Keene, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, for sources of the information.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s start with the statement that abstinence-only education costs the state $400,000. Keene said that&rsquo;s a reference to match money Virginia provided to receive a federal grant for abstinence-only sex education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe payment allows Virginia to participate in the Title V Abstinence Education Grant Program administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The program promotes abstinence until marriage to prevent teen pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast September, HHS announced Virginia would receive an $889,973 grant for abstinence education for fiscal 2010. &nbsp;States have until Sept. 30, 2012, to spend the money. The federal cash pays for 57 percent of the cost of abstinence programs approved by HHS.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tParticipating states are required to provide the remaining 43 percent of cost. The match money can come from a variety of sources including from state coffers, foundation dollars and in-kind donations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVirginia was required to come up with about $670,000 to match the grant.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJeff Caldwell, a spokesman for the governor, said in an e-mail that the state is paying $382,688 towards the match. The rest is coming from in-kind contributions and community organizations awarded contracts to implement the sexual abstinence programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo NARAL is near the bull&rsquo;s-eye in claiming Virginia is paying an &quot;approximate&quot; $400,000 for abstinence-until marriage programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCaldwell noted that the state received federal abstinence education funding under previous governors going back to the 1990s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in 2007, Democratic Governor Tim Kaine cut the state&rsquo;s funding for abstinence-only education. McDonnell reversed that decision last year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the same time, McDonnell chose not to seek money from another federal grant program that &nbsp;teaches students about contraception in addition to abstinence -- the Personal Responsibility Education Program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnlike the federal abstinence-only money, the comprehensive sex education grant requires no match. McDonnell&rsquo;s refusal to participate drew criticism from NARAL and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat brings us to the second part of NARAL&rsquo;s claim, that Virginia lost $2.5 million in federal money for comprehensive sex education under McDonnell. As a source, NARAL cited an HHS 49-page announcement of the PREP grant, which was created under the 2010 health care reform law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe HHS synopsis shows Virginia was estimated to receive a total of $2,593,487 during fiscal years 2010 and 2011. That&rsquo;s close to NARAL&rsquo;s number.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut NARAL is greatly understating its case. States that didn&rsquo;t apply for the grant in fiscal 2010 and 2011 are not eligible to seek funding for the 2012-2014 fiscal years. So Virginia potentially missed out on much more than $2.6 million. Estimates for 2012-2014 allotments are not available, said Kenneth Wolfe, an HHS spokesman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s recap:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA video by NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia said that abstinence-only programs pursued under McDonnell have cost the state about $400,000. Meanwhile, the group says the state missed out on about $2.5 million in federal funding for comprehensive sex education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s true the state spent about $400,000 for a federal abstinence-only grant. And it&rsquo;s true that the McDonnell administration did not apply for a comprehensive sex education grant that would have sent almost $2.6 million to Virginia during fiscal year 2010 and 2011. Because Virginia is now ineligible to apply for the comprehensive grant through 2014, the state will wind up declining a much greater amount of money than NARAL claimed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe won&rsquo;t penalize NARAL for understating its case. Its statement is True.&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-06-24T11:12:14.657329", "ruling_date": "2011-06-27T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "NARAL says McDonnell's agenda costs state federal sex ed money", "ruling_headline_slug": "naral-says-mcdonnells-agenda-costs-state-federal-s", "ruling_link_text": "NARAL actually understates its case", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNARAL Pro-Choice Virginia <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW5ADMipfgY&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=103\">web video,</a>accessed June 13, 2011.
