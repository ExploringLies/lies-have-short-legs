States are free to set their own minimum wage rates, as long as they don&rsquo;t go &nbsp;below the federal level. Last year, the General Assembly increased Rhode Island&rsquo;s minimum wage to $8 an hour, effective Jan. 1, 2014, and there are proposals to increase it further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stenhouse argues that the economic effects of raising the minimum wage are exaggerated by those who want to increase it. Most workers who support a family are already getting more than the minimum wage, he says, while those earning the minimum wage are usually young people supplementing an already above-the-minimum combined family income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Jan. 27, in a news release, Stenhouse quantified that claim. Of Rhode Islanders who are earning minimum wage, he said, &quot;only 14 percent serve as sole income earner for their family.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Stenhouse about his statement, he said the source of the data was the Employment Policies Institute, a &nbsp;business-backed, Washington, D.C.-based organization that produces research critical of state and federal minimum wages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The employment institute prepared the research for the Rhode Center for Freedom and Prosperity last spring, when the General Assembly was considering raising the minimum wage to $8.25, so that was the figure used in the study. &nbsp;The legislature wound up approving an $8-an-hour minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report is posted on the Center for Freedom and Prosperity&rsquo;s website, rifreedom.org, with a pie chart that illustrates its findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Saltsman, research director of the Employment Policies Institute, told us that its analysis was derived from a regular monthly survey conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics in which people are asked about their incomes and family status, among other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The institute found that, of Rhode Islanders earning less than $8.25-an-hour, 8 percent were single parents and 6 percent were married and the sole family earner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stenhouse said he added those together to get his 14 percent. He said he picked those two categories specifically, because he was focusing on families getting by on minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We weren&rsquo;t able to recreate Saltsman&rsquo;s results, but other groups that have used the same data have ended up with similar findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heidi Shierholz is an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, based in Washington, D.C., that advocates increasing the minimum wage. She said the numbers Stenhouse used didn&rsquo;t seem out of line, but she added he was carving a narrow demographic slice from the total population affected by minimum wage increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, as Stenhouse points out, he specifically limited his statement to families, not the broader category of households. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Stenhouse says only 14 percent of Rhode Islanders earning minimum wage or less are the sole earners for their families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stenhouse was citing figures from an established research group that another research group, with an opposite political philosophy, found to be credible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study he cited was based on an $8.25 wage, rather than Rhode Island&rsquo;s $8 rate. But that&rsquo;s not enough to make a big difference.
