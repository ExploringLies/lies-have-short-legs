Bob McDonnell says he feels the pain of rising college tuition.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The average kid comes out of Virginia colleges with about $25,000 plus in debt, and that&rsquo;s just not acceptable long-term,&quot; he said during a Dec. 6 news conference.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo doubt, a college education is expensive. But we wondered if the governor&rsquo;s debt figure is correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPaul Logan, a McDonnell spokesman, said his boss&rsquo;s statement is based on <a href=\"http://www.projectonstudentdebt.org/state_by_state-view2012.php?area=VA\">data</a> in an October 2012 report by the Institute for College Access &amp; Success, a nonprofit group that annually examines the debt loads of graduates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://projectonstudentdebt.org/files/pub/classof2011.pdf\">study</a> tallied the average student debt in each state for the 2010-2011 academic year. Among Virginia graduates who had taken out loans, the average debt was $24,717, ranking 23rd highest in the nation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s pretty close to McDonnell&rsquo;s number, but there&rsquo;s a major caveat: that figure only averages the debt of students who took out loans. It does not take into account those who were fortunate enough to graduate without debt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe institute&rsquo;s figures show that 59 percent of Virginia students graduated with debt and 41 percent did not.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://college-insight.org/#spotlight/go&amp;h=9da6cab0766b6949798d052581edf702\">website</a> said the average debt among Virginia graduates who got bachelor degrees during the 2010-11 school year was $14,628.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe debt data comes from answers colleges provide to a survey by Peterson&rsquo;s, a college guide publishing company. Peterson&rsquo;s survey, which looks at students graduating from four-year public universities and private nonprofit colleges, was answered by 55 percent of colleges and universities that awarded bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in the 2010-2011 school year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe institute says there are limitations to the figures it uses in its report. Very few for-profit colleges report figures on student debt, and those schools typically generate high borrowing, the report says. And because the data is provided voluntarily, colleges &quot;may actually have a disincentive for honest and full reporting,&quot; the study says. The group also says that colleges may not be aware of the full private loan debt held borne by their graduates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDespite those concerns, the institute says the Peterson survey is the only data that allows analysis of student debt among bachelors&rsquo; degrees recipients.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne final note: Student loans by no means encompass all the money borrowed for college. In 2011, the federal government disbursed $10.6 billion in Parent Plus loans to just under 1 million families, according to a <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-govt-is-saddling-parents-with-college-loans-they-cant-afford\">report</a> by ProPublica and The Chronicle of Higher Education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcDonnell said the average student graduating from Virginia colleges is about $25,000 in debt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe study he cites says that&rsquo;s the level of debt among students who have taken out loans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut McDonnell omits a key point. The average he cited doesn&rsquo;t count a large number of students who graduated debt free. When they are included, the average is $14,628.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we rate his claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-12-23T19:05:36.652591", "ruling_date": "2012-12-24T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "McDonnell says Virginia college graduates facing average $25,000 debt", "ruling_headline_slug": "mcdonnell-says-virginia-college-graduates-facing-a", "ruling_link_text": "Omits key information", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tGov.
