Even the Old Dominion University researchers whose work was cited as support for the connection said it was wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But by then it was too late to correct the record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The<strong> </strong>claim has found new life amid cable news coverage of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice and Minnesota Vikings running back <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/18/sports/football/adrian-peterson-barred-from-team-activities-as-vikings-reverse-course.html?_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Adrian Peterson</u></a>. <em>Morning Joe</em> host Mika Brzezinski used it to support her argument that there is a connection between violence at home and aggressive play on the football field on MSNBC&rsquo;s<em> Morning Joe</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You look at Super Bowl Sunday. Super Bowl Sunday has the highest rate of domestic violence,&quot; she said Sept. 16. &quot;There&rsquo;s something about the game!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minutes later, she said, &quot;This is a violent game. And domestic violence on Super Bowl Sunday. We&#39;ve seen the numbers. Why is that?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The truth is that Super Bowl Sunday is not a unique day for domestic violence, says Callie Rennison, a University of Colorado Denver public affairs professor who studies domestic violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is not to be confused with there being no violence or a lower amount of violence on Super Bowl Sunday,&quot; Rennison said. &quot;It happens on holidays, it happens on weekends, and it happens on weekdays.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rennison sent us a <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/2540817/Give_me_shelter_Temporal_patterns_of_women_fleeing_domestic_abuse._Human_Organization_66_3_249-260\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2007 study</u></a> published in <em>Human Organization</em>, the journal of the Society for Applied Anthropology, which<strong> </strong>concluded that the belief that domestic violence crisis calls increase during drink holidays in general, including the Super Bowl, is unsubstantiated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Press coverage of the original news conference 20 years ago said a California Women&rsquo;s Law Center official cited research to bolster her comments. The lawyer, Sheila Kuehl, was reported as citing an academic study that found a 40 percent uptick in police reports of beatings and hospital admissions after Washington Redskins victories between 1988-89.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But &quot;that&rsquo;s not what we found at all,&quot; Janet Katz, the Old Dominion University criminology professor who worked on the study, told the <em>Washington Post</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Katz said her &quot;tentative findings&quot; did not correlate an increase in ER admissions of women with football games in general or with men upset by a team loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for MSNBC did not offer comment by deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brzezinski invoked a widely debunked claim that Super Bowl Sunday has the highest rate of domestic violence on <em>Morning Joe.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s no more true now than 20 years ago.
