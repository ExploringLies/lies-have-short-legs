It&rsquo;s a major reason why we&rsquo;ve seen 50,000 fewer preventable patient deaths in hospitals.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hadn&rsquo;t heard the claim about preventable deaths, so we took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked the White House for its evidence, they pointed us to a <a href=\"http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/quality-patient-safety/pfp/interimhacrate2013.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>report</u></a> from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Prepare yourself for its very wonky title: &quot;Interim Update on 2013 Annual Hospital-Acquired Condition Rate and Estimates of Cost Savings and Deaths Averted From 2010 to 2013.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The agency is a part of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, and its report takes a preliminary look at a program called Partnership for Patients that was <a href=\"http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140503/MAGAZINE/305039985\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>created by the health care law.</u></a> The program <a href=\"http://partnershipforpatients.cms.gov/about-the-partnership/aboutthepartnershipforpatients.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>aims</u></a> to get 3,700 hospitals -- along with physicians, nurses, employers, patients, government officials and others -- to work together to cut preventable hospital-acquired conditions by 40 percent between 2010 and 2014 and to reduce hospital readmissions by 20 percent over the same period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report found that &quot;approximately 50,000 fewer patients died in the hospital as a result of the reduction in HACs<strong> </strong>(hospital-acquired conditions), and approximately $12 billion in health care costs were saved from 2010 to 2013.&quot; This occurred &quot;during a period of concerted attention by hospitals throughout the country to reduce adverse events,&quot; the report said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Independent experts said the report is credible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lucian Leape, an adjunct professor of health policy at Harvard University&rsquo;s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told PolitiFact, &quot;I think these data are reliable, and the ACA (Affordable Care Act) deserves credit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leape, who has been studying preventable hospital deaths since the early 1990s, credited improved data collection and the work of Partnership for Patients, &quot;which has been a serious &ndash; and successful &ndash; effort to engage hospitals in achieving specific goals, such as reducing infections.&quot; He said it&rsquo;s the kind of effort he and others called for a decade and a half ago but &quot;never got before the ACA. Hospitals were improving their safety slowly on their own, and this gave it a big boost. It&#39;s the first time we have seen measurable,&nbsp;significant decreases in any of the harms that we cause by treatment failures.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David Nash, dean of the Jefferson School of Population Health in Philadelphia, agreed that the numbers are credible. &quot;This is in part due to a huge amount of work on the part of hospitals,&quot; Nash said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do see two fairly minor caveats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>These numbers are estimates</strong>. Obviously, it&rsquo;s not possible to literally count the number of deaths prevented in the same way you can count actual deaths. So the authors of the report had to use a complicated set of estimating techniques to come up with the 50,000 figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors of the report made a point of including some caveats, including that &quot;the estimate of deaths averted is less precise than the estimate of the size of the reduction&quot; in hospital-acquired conditions.&quot; The report also notes &quot;uncertainty inherent in our statistical extrapolations&quot; and says that it&rsquo;s &quot;clear&quot; that &quot;tens of thousands of deaths&quot; have been averted, which is less specific than the 50,000 figure Obama focused on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Preventable deaths had already begun falling even before the health care law was enacted</strong>. Periodically, the Centers for Disease Control and Protection has analyzed data on inpatient hospital deaths, with its <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db118.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>most recent analysis</u></a> covering data through 2010. That analysis found that the number of inpatient hospital deaths (not just preventable ones) decreased from 776,000 in 2000 to 715,000 in 2010 -- a drop of 61,000 over a decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, hospital deaths in general were already on a downward slope prior to the health care law&rsquo;s passage; it&rsquo;s just accelerated since then. The authors of the report that Obama cited also hedged a bit on the causes for the decline, writing that &quot;the precise causes of the decline in patient harm are not fully understood.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama said the Affordable Care Act is &quot;a major reason why we&rsquo;ve seen 50,000 fewer preventable patient deaths in hospitals.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Independent experts said the report Obama was using as evidence represents a credible attempt to quantify recent improvements in preventing hospital-patient deaths, even if the numbers are estimates rather than hard figures. They added that it&rsquo;s reasonable to credit the health care law&rsquo;s Partnership for Patients program with accelerating the gains, even if the improvements were already under way at the time the law was passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-03-30T16:19:25.234205", "ruling_date": "2015-03-31T10:54:35", "ruling_headline": "Barack Obama says health care law has led to 50,000 fewer preventable hospital deaths", "ruling_headline_slug": "barack-obama-says-health-care-law-has-led-50000-", "ruling_link_text": "A credible estimate says so", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Barack Obama, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/25/remarks-president-marking-fifth-anniversary-affordable-care-act\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>remarks on the fifth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act</u></a>, March 25, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/quality-patient-safety/pfp/interimhacrate2013.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Interim Update on 2013 Annual Hospital-Acquired Condition Rate and Estimates of Cost Savings and Deaths Averted From 2010 to 2013</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 2, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db118.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Trends in Inpatient Hospital Deaths: National Hospital Discharge Survey, 2000&ndash;2010</u></a>,&quot; March 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, &quot;<a href=\"http://archive.ahrq.gov/news/newsletters/research-activities/jun11/0611RA30.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Partnership for Patients initiative launched to improve care and lower costs for Americans</u></a>,&quot; June 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, &quot;<a href=\"http://partnershipforpatients.cms.gov/about-the-partnership/aboutthepartnershipforpatients.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>About the Partnership for Patients</u></a>,&quot; accessed March 30, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Department of Health and Human Services, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2014pres/12/20141202a.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Efforts to improve patient safety result in 1.3 million fewer patient harms, 50,000 lives saved and $12 billion in health spending avoided</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 2, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/09/20/224507654/how-many-die-from-medical-mistakes-in-u-s-hospitals\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>How Many Die From Medical Mistakes In U.S. Hospitals?</u></a>&quot; Sept. 20, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Modern Healthcare</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140503/MAGAZINE/305039985\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Partnership for Patients hospitals tout quality improvements but critics see a lost opportunity</u></a>,&quot; May 3, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with David Nash, dean of the Jefferson School of Population Health in Philadelphia, March 27, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Lucian Leape, adjunct professor of health policy at Harvard University&rsquo;s T.H.
