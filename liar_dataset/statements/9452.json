Scott Walker often point to the post-recession progress in Minnesota, where the jobs recovery has outpaced that of Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker, meanwhile, prefers <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-12-06/opinion/ct--20131206_1_new-teachers-contract-hey-illinois-pay-raise\">comparisons to Illinois</a> and its budget problems and big tax hikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2013, we rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/15/joe-atkins/rebuffing-scott-walker-minnesota-lawmaker-says-his/\">Half True</a> a Minnesota lawmaker&rsquo;s claim that the Gopher State is &quot;kicking butt relative to Wisconsin&quot; on employment, school test scores, workforce education and other rankings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we haven&rsquo;t, until now, tested claims of an income gap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke proclaimed such a gap in June 6, 2014 <a href=\"http://www.wiseye.org/Programming/VideoArchive/EventDetail.aspx?evhdid=8776\">remarks to delegates</a> gathered in Lake Delton for the state Democratic Party&rsquo;s annual convention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As you know,&quot; Burke said, &quot;our current governor has made quite a name for himself. His divisive brand of politics may have made national headlines, but those policies have hurt middle-class families right here in Wisconsin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She added: &quot;But the people of Wisconsin, we know Scott Walker. He promised us 250,000 new jobs. But what did we get? We&rsquo;re 9th out of 10 midwestern states in job growth -- ninth out of 10! And the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see if Burke&rsquo;s statement about a Minnesota advantage in the Walker era holds up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the numbers show</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burke&rsquo;s campaign cited one source for numbers on earnings. We looked at it and two others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All show Minnesota on top.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- The annual average wage of Minnesota workers was $47,370 as of May 2013 -- $5,060 higher than the $42,310 figure for Wisconsin, according to survey-based estimates published by the federal <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oessrcst.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. The 2013 data is the most recent available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- Average earnings per job in 2012 were $53,928 in Minnesota, $4,931 more than Wisconsin&rsquo;s $48,997, according to the most recent U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. That figure takes in a larger group -- not only workers&rsquo; wages and salaries but &quot;proprietor&rsquo;s income&quot; from self-employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- The same data, stripped down to exclude proprietor&rsquo;s income to focus more on regular salaries and wages, shows a gap of $5,757 in Minnesota&rsquo;s favor, according to research by Dale Knapp at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Burke&rsquo;s figures are solid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More about the numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her convention speech, Burke argued in a general way that Walker&rsquo;s policies are linked to the wage gap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given all the factors that influence a state&rsquo;s economy, experts agree the actions of a governor have a limited effect. Nevertheless, Burke&rsquo;s claim misses the mark by pinning the gap solely on Walker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Minnesota-Wisconsin wage gap dates to at least the 1960s, and gradually has grown despite ups and downs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki about that, he argued that Walker&#39;s economic policies -- which Walker touts as turning the state around -- haven&#39;t improved it or closed that gap. As examples, he cited Walker&rsquo;s refusal to accept the federal expansion of Medicaid and his opposition to a minimum wage increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By any of our three measures, the gap did not narrow in Walker&rsquo;s first two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It grew significantly based on the average earnings per job data. It held steady if you use the other two methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The average earnings data shows the Minnesota wage advantage averaged 7.4 percent during the second four-year term of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, who preceded Walker. So far under Walker the average is 8.8 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gap of 9.1 percent in 2012, Walker&rsquo;s second year, is the highest since 2000, when Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson was in charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not that Wisconsin&rsquo;s average wage has fallen during the Walker era. It&rsquo;s up 5.5 percent in two years, right around the national average increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Minnesota has fared somewhat better, which creates the increase in the gap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In combing through the annual average wage data for the two states, there are some interesting disparities between specific jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minnesota ran up part of its lead on these:</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"width:600px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Occupation</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Minnesota average wage</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Wisconsin average wage</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Registered nurse</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$71,160</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$64,460</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Management, all positions</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$107,130</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$97,920</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Dentist</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$193,100</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$177,430</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Police and sheriff patrol officer</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$58,220</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$54,140</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Social worker (child/family/school)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$59,830</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$49,720</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>School bus driver</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$32,500</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$29,190</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Computer systems analyst</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$81,560</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$75,170</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Lawyer</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$126,520</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$105,080</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin holds the upper hand in other categories, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"height:1px; width:600px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Occupation</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Minnesota average wage</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Wisconsin average wage</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Farm, fishing, forestry</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$30,910</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$31,260</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Retail Salesperson</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$23,730</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$24,420</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Mortician, undertaker, funeral director</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$58,340</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$65,720</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Chiropractor</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$72,810</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$90,170</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Pediatrician</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$185,550</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$200,480</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a bankrate.com calcuator, the Minneapolis area&rsquo;s cost of living is 8.5% higher than that of the Milwaukee metro area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burke told delegates at the state Democratic convention that &quot;the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota&quot; under Walker&rsquo;s policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gap is real and Burke hit the mark with her description of it.
