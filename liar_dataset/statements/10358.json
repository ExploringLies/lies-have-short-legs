In the liberal <em>New Republic</em>, Brian Beutler <u><a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120707/mitch-mcconnell-becomes-majority-leader-takes-credit-economy?utm_content=buffer9d703&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">joked</a>,</u>&nbsp;&quot;It absolutely <em>does</em> coincide with the expectation of a new Republican Congress. Relatedly, things that coincide are called &lsquo;coincidences.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But is McConnell even right that the economic data and the political expectations coincided? We focused on two questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, when did &quot;the expectation of a new Republican Congress&quot; actually solidify? And second, was there an uptick in economic data that actually coincided with that time frame? We&rsquo;ll also briefly address the question of causation, even though McConnell didn&rsquo;t explicitly claim that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data we found suggest&nbsp;McConnell is engaging in some wishful thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When did &quot;the expectation of a new Republican Congress&quot; actually emerge? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To answer this question, we checked with political analysts who handicapped the 2014 battle for the Senate and also looked at poll-based forecasting models. McConnell said &quot;expectation,&quot; a stronger word than &quot;possibility&quot; and one that requires a reasonable degree of consensus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Going into the 2014 Senate elections, most observers expected the GOP to gain seats, due primarily to a favorable map for the GOP (far more Democrats were up for re-election, especially in conservative states) combined with the longstanding history of &quot;six-year-itch&quot; midterm elections bedeviling second-term presidents, in this case Democrat Barack Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But whether the GOP would actually manage to win enough seats to seize control of the chamber -- six -- was less certain. Going into the election, the Democrats held a 55-45 edge (counting two Democratic-caucusing Independents as Democrats). With many individual races rated as highly competitive right through Election Day, winning a net six seats was no slam dunk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jennifer Duffy, who handicaps Senate races for the Cook Political Report, said different political experts settled on a Republican takeover at different times but added that she felt &quot;pretty comfortable with a gain of six seats around Labor Day,&quot; which was on Sept. 1 last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato&#39;s Crystal Ball, agreed that Labor Day was a turning point, though he added that &quot;there were slivers of doubt right up until the end. We formally called the Senate for the Republicans the week before the election, but we also suggested that a GOP Senate was likely in the months prior to the election.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The forecasters at <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/senate-forecast/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>fivethirtyeight.com</u></a> suggested the toss-up lasted past Labor Day. They calculated the likelihood of a GOP takeover at just over 50 percent as late as mid&nbsp;September, before rising again, ultimately to 76 percent on the eve of the election. The <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/senate-model/index.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>New York Times</u></a></em>&rsquo; in-house forecast saw much the same pattern, narrowing to essentially a coin flip in mid&nbsp;September before climbing to a 75 percent chance of a GOP takeover by Election Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All told, this suggests that an &quot;expectation&quot; of a GOP takeover didn&rsquo;t emerge until the beginning of September at the earliest, and possibly as late as the second half of September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This leads to our next question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Has there been an economic &quot;uptick&quot; that &quot;appears to coincide&quot; with this timeline?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McConnell&rsquo;s office pointed us to the announcement that the economy grew at an annualized 5 percent rate in the third quarter of 2014, the biggest <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-23/economy-grows-by-most-in-a-decade-on-u-s-consumer-spending-gain.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>expansion</u></a> in more than a decade. So we&rsquo;ll start there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/glance.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>figure</u></a> was indeed impressive. But there are two problems with citing this as evidence for McConnell&rsquo;s point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the third quarter covers July, August and September. So the bulk of this growth occurred before the expectation of a GOP Senate began to jell. Second, GDP growth for the <em>second </em>quarter -- covering April, May and June of 2014 -- was almost as impressive, 4.6 percent. And that was well before the &quot;expectation&quot; of a GOP takeover seemed to take hold. (In fact, for much of that quarter, the <em>New York Times </em>model showed the Democrats likelier to win control than the Republicans.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the longer-term trend for GDP growth shows that three of the past five quarters -- that is, since mid&nbsp;2013 -- have exceeded 4 percent growth, and another quarter came close to that. Only one quarter, the first quarter of 2014, was a dud. So it&rsquo;s not as if the impressive third-quarter growth of 2014 came totally out of the blue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tsfhh2VNsdreYrka1Yj85kxGVoX9vXxvi892-KEQkQJeHA148wu3rt7dB6rG2vyrOrEHn14pmvLsJapeVDw3XwziHIQ-i8IcMbw-e9Vt848NSTjtfmhuFSJIBJj_Syt8RQ\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:396px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also looked at another major yardstick for the economy -- the monthly change in employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During 2014, <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0000000001?output_view=net_1mth\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>total monthly employment gains</u></a> averaged 241,000.

It&rsquo;s too soon to tell whether November&rsquo;s figure kicks off a new, higher threshold or whether the number settles back again into the 240,000 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cSIpkC1Jv8uLrxkFXgSdX54rvaPK5c0Xjb6-j4JMX-ZcrzpSyCMFcm3-Brj3tLh08AzwSvP80aYHcwbHmhUjp1Mp3cTyHW2mykSVzlkAvlEDSPa9Rb2wTMZjpsbmu3F2tQ\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:257px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:523px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strongest evidence for McConnell&rsquo;s point is consumer confidence.
