He said the birther sideshow -- which was discredited a few days later when Obama released his long-form U.S. birth certificate -- was hurting Republicans by scaring away undecided voters, and distracting people from important issues. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This is so offensive to independents and to people in this country today ... who worry that China now owns $1.1 trillion of our debt, our trade deficit last year with them was a quarter of a trillion dollars. They&rsquo;re worried about their job. They&rsquo;re worried about their children&rsquo;s job. And this gibberish that they talk about on television is doing nothing and other countries are moving at warp speed ahead of us on renewable energy, wind, electric cars...&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tOK, before McAuliffe starts plugging his electric car company, as he is wont, let&rsquo;s take a look at those digits and dollar signs he&rsquo;s throwing around. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe $1.1 trillion sounded familiar, so we&rsquo;ll examine that one first.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor a source, McAuliffe provided a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/01/businesspro-us-markets-bonds-idUSTRE7206XG20110301\">March 1 </a><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/01/businesspro-us-markets-bonds-idUSTRE7206XG20110301\">article </a>from Reuters. The second paragraph of that story supports his claim:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Treasury Department data released on Monday showed that China held $1.16 trillion in U.S. government debt in December, the most recent month for which figures are available, up from prior estimates of $892 billion,&quot; the story says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWell, that&rsquo;s true. The latest figures from the U.S. Treasury Department show China held $1.154 trillion in U.S. debt in February -- down $600 million from January. Japan was the second-largest holder, at $890.3 billion, with Great Britain third at $295.5 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s a little background: The total federal debt, as of May 2, was $14.29 trillion. Of that amount, about $9.65 trillion is called public debt, which refers to all federal securities held by institutions and individuals outside the U.S. government. That includes China and other foreign nations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe remaining debt -- about $4.64 trillion -- is held by the Federal Financing Bank, U.S. government trust funds, and other federal funds and accounts. The largest trust fund is the one that endows Social Security.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcAuliffe, for his second claim, &nbsp;used a report from the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution that reports: &quot;In 2010, the U.S.-China trade deficit increased to over $273 billion, the highest bilateral trade deficit on record. It represents almost 55 percent of the total U.S. trade deficit.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked it out, and that&rsquo;s true, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html\">according to the U.S. Census Bureau</a>. If you&rsquo;re curious, this year&rsquo;s trade deficit through February was $42.1 billion. That&rsquo;s almost 36 percent of the United States&rsquo; $117.8 billion trade deficit for the first two months of the year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLooking back, this is an open-and-shut case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe cannot confirm McAuliffe&rsquo;s claim that independent voters are offended by The Donald. But he&rsquo;s right on his numbers: China owns $1.1 trillion in U.S. debt; our trade deficit with China was about $275 billion last year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth scary, both True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-03T13:34:22.821317", "ruling_date": "2011-05-03T13:32:34", "ruling_headline": "Terry McAuliffe says China owns $1.1 trillion in U.S. debt", "ruling_headline_slug": "terry-mcauliffe-says-china-owns-11-trillion-us-deb", "ruling_link_text": "Made in China, held in China", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tHardball with Chris Matthews, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036697/#42770358\">segment on Donald Trump</a>, April 26, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReuters, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/01/businesspro-us-markets-bonds-idUSTRE7206XG20110301\">China seen as risk as holdings surpass $1 trillion</a>,&quot; March 1, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrookings, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2011/0214_trade_deficit_meltzer.aspx\">The U.S. Trade Deficit, China and the Need to Rebalance Growth</a>,&quot; Feb. 14, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html\">Trade in Goods with China</a>, accessed May 2, 2011.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/apr/26/randy-forbes/randy-forbes-says-us-pays-china-739-million-day-de/\">Randy Forbes says the U.S. pays China $73.9 million per day in debt interest</a>, April 26, 2011.</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 12, "current_job": "Governor", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "Terry", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 1189, "last_name": "McAuliffe", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "terry-mcauliffe", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mcauliffe1.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1189/", "total_count": 34, "true_count": 6, "website": "http://www.terrymcauliffe.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;China now owns $1.1 trillion of our debt, our trade deficit last year with them was a quarter of a trillion dollars.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "an appearance on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews.", "statement_date": "2011-05-26", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 180, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/180/", "subject": "China", "subject_slug": "china", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 183, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/183/", "subject": "Deficit", "subject_slug": "deficit", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 143, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/143/", "subject": "Trade", "subject_slug": "trade", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
