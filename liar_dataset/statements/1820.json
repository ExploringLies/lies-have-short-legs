He said Djou's  victory was more about the unique circumstances of the special election -- which was called to replace the resigning Rep. Neil Abercrombie until the regular fall election --&nbsp;  than a political mood swing in Hawaii. The special election did not  include a primary, which meant parties could field multiple candidates.  Of the three main contenders, two were Democrats while Djou was the lone  Republican. He won with a little under 40 percent of the overall vote.<br /><br />\"In  the November election, it will be one Democrat against one Republican,  and we feel very, very confident about winning that race,\" Kaine said.<br /><br />But  Steele countered, Hawaii doesn't \"have a history of throwing incumbents  out of office.\"<br /><br />It's an obvious fact that incumbents have an  easier road to re-election than challengers. Since 1964, no less than 85  percent of incumbents have been returned to the U.S. House, according  to the Center for Responsive Politics. Since 1998, incumbents'  re-election rate has hovered between 94 and 98 percent in the House. The  numbers in the Senate are a little lower -- between 79 and 96 percent  in elections since 1998.<br /><br />But do incumbents have an even easier  time getting re-elected in America's youngest state?<br /><br />Since Hawaii  wasn't incorporated as a state until 1959, there isn't a lot of history  to examine. And since Hawaii has just four members of Congress (two  senators and two members of the U.S. House), there are relatively few  elections to scour.<br /><br />In fact, only 5 people have represented the  state in the U.S. Senate: the two sitting senators, Democrats Daniel  Inouye and Daniel Akaka, and three others -- Republican Hiram Fong,  Democrat Spark Matsunaga and Democrat Oren E. Long. None of them lost a  re-election campaign for the Senate -- Fong and Long retired and  Matsunaga died in office.<br /><br />Hawaii's two congressional House  districts were created in 1971. Previously both seats had been elected  at large.<br /><br />Djou will represent Hawaii's 1st District, the second  Republican ever to do so. He replaces Abercrombie, a 10-term  Democrat who resigned to run for governor. The state's 2nd District has  never elected a Republican.<br /><br />Have any incumbents lost?<br /><br />Not  really.<br /><br />In the 2nd District, Patsy Mink, Daniel Akaka and Ed Case  all resigned or retired in order to run for another office. Mink was  eventually re-elected to the U.S. House and died in office.<br /><br />In  the 1st District, Spark Matsunaga, Cecil Heftel, Pat Saiki and  Abercrombie all also resigned to run for another office.<br /><br />There's  one asterisk. Abercrombie was first elected to Congress in 1986 in a  special election just like Djou. But though he won the special election,  he lost his party's primary to run for a full, two-year term on the  very same day. <br /><br />We counted and found about 50 elections where the  incumbent on Hawaii was on the ballot. The closest anyone got to losing  was Abercrombie in 1986, but he wasn't actually an incumbent when he  lost the Democratic primary.<br /><br />Depending how you count it, that  puts the re-election rate in Hawaii between 98 percent and 100 percent,  which is higher than the national average over the same period. <br /><br />Though  Steele was talking about federal races, we also checked to see if an  incumbent Hawaii governor ever lost a bid for re-election. It happened  once since Hawaii became a state, in 1962, when Republican William Quinn  lost to Democrat John Burns. <br /><br />Back to the statement by RNC  Chairman Steele. He said Hawaiians don't have a history of  throwing incumbents out of office and said that Djou's election  to Congress in May means Republicans have a good shot of keeping the  seat in November. While we're not in the business of predicting the  outcome of House races, no incumbent has ever lost a November  congressional election in Hawaii. We rate Steele's claim True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-05-23T13:52:36.346279", "ruling_date": "2010-05-23T18:11:09", "ruling_headline": "RNC chair Michael Steele says Republican victory in Hawaii boosts GOP chances", "ruling_headline_slug": "rnc-chair-michael-steele-says-republican-victory-h", "ruling_link_text": "Incumbent advantage magnified in Hawaii", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Congressional Quartlery, ABC This Week transcript, May 23, 2010<br /><br />Honolulu Star Bulletin, <a href=\"http://www.starbulletin.com/news/bulletin/94673904.html\" target=\"_blank\">Djou wins special election for Congress</a>, May 23, 2010<br /><br />Honolulu Advertiser, <a href=\"http://www.apaforprogress.org/neil-abercrombie-announces-resignation-date\" target=\"_blank\">Abercrombie announces resignation date</a>, Jan. 15, 2010<br /><br />Center for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:hvWA9_kfaSUJ:www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/reelect.php+incumbent+reelection+rate&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\" target=\"_blank\">Re-election rates over the years</a>, accessed May 23, 2010<br /><br />U.S. Sen.
