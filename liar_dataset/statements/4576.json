Gov. David Dewhurst.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a <a href=\"http://www.tedcruz.org/memo-ducking-dewhurst-debate-prep-cheat-sheet-2/\">&quot;memo&quot;</a> directed at Dewhurst the next day, Cruz&rsquo;s campaign consultant, Jason Johnson, said: &quot;Yesterday, your campaign distributed two emails -- signed expressly by &lsquo;Dewhurst for Texas&rsquo; -- that accused Ted Cruz of being a &lsquo;Red&rsquo; Chinese&quot; Communist. Cruz&rsquo;s campaign copied the note to &quot;interested parties,&quot; meaning reporters and anyone else tuned to the pair&rsquo;s rivalry<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFeel those not-so-good &lsquo;50s coming back?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCruz&rsquo;s camp sent us the two emails from Dewhurst&rsquo;s camp. One was headlined &quot;Red Ted Cruz shows his true colors, consistently stands with China against American interests&quot; and signed by Steven Cheung of Dewhurst&rsquo;s campaign. The email points out that Cruz opposes legislation offered in Congress to penalize China for propping up its currency. The email closes: &quot;At a time when millions of Americans are without jobs, why does Ted Cruz consistently put the needs of China before America?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe other email, signed by Justin Hollis of Dewhurst&rsquo;s campaign, has the subject line: &quot;What Does Ted Cruz Have Against America?&quot; Its text refers to Cruz&rsquo;s opposition to the Chinese currency measure and also quotes from a Laura Ingraham interview of Cruz and a blog post by Texas Monthly&rsquo;s Paul Burka about Cruz, a lawyer, acting as counsel to a Chinese company accused of patent infringement by an American. The email identically closes: &quot;At a time when millions of Americans are without jobs, why does Ted Cruz consistently put the needs of China before America?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch told us that Cruz&rsquo;s charge is false grandstanding compared with the issues raised by the Dewhurst blasts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe legislation opposed by Cruz would compel the Obama administration to levy tariffs and other penalties against China and other countries for having &quot;misaligned&quot; currencies, according to an Oct. 7, 2011, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203476804576614852274719120.html\">news post </a>by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, amid concern that China holds down the value of its currency, the yuan, in an effort to boost the country&#39;s exports. Opponents have warned that approval of the proposal could lead China to launch a trade war.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd what of the patent infringement case? Burka, in an Oct. 3, 2011, <a href=\"http://www.texasmonthly.com/blogs/burkablog/?p=11444\">blog post</a>, recaps a Sept. 28, 2011, <a href=\"http://www.plazadearmastx.com/index.php/politics/100-columns/1475-cruz-control-in-senate-race\">post </a>on the San Antonio-based Plaza de Armas blog stating that in his work for a Houston firm, Cruz appealed a ruling against a Chinese conglomerate in a patent piracy case brought by a Florida businessman. Nothing wrong with that in legal terms, the originating blog says, though in political terms, &quot;the idea of a Tea Party darling (Cruz) representing an alleged patent thief against a geriatric American entrepreneur, at a time when the U.S. economy is in shambles and China is the largest international holder of American debt, has the whiff of trouble about it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerhaps Dewhurst scores political points on these fronts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPer our review, neither Dewhurst email explicitly says Cruz is a Chinese Communist.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen again, we wondered if it&rsquo;s reasonable to read the &quot;Red Ted&quot; subject line of one of them as anything but a claim that Cruz aligns with, or even is, a Chinese Communist. John Drogin, Cruz&rsquo;s campaign manager, pointed us to a Dictionary.com <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/red\">definition</a> of &quot;red&quot; as a &quot;radical leftist in politics, especially a Communist.&quot; He also noted a Republican blogger&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://ponderingpenguin.blogspot.com/2011/10/ted-cruz-is-republican-red-not.html?spref=tw\">post</a> interpreting the &quot;red Ted&quot; label in the email as meaning Communist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You know that &lsquo;red&rsquo; is a clear euphemism for Communist and in the context of China,&quot; Drogin said. &quot;Dewhurst&#39;s staffer&#39;s remark is even more obviously so.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe &quot;red Ted&quot; reference might seem especially pointed because Cruz&rsquo;s father fought alongside Fidel Castro and the rebels in Cuba before fleeing the island nation for Texas; he later decided Castro was not the leader he&rsquo;d wished for, according to a January 2006 <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/01152006_aasstorytedcruz.doc\">news article</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll told, it&rsquo;s reasonable to take the subject line of one Dewhurst email as calling Cruz a Chinese Communist; the other cited email similarly depicts Cruz as siding with China over the United States, but doesn&rsquo;t include the &quot;red&quot; label. We rate Cruz&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-10T17:05:59.400030", "ruling_date": "2011-10-11T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ted Cruz says David Dewhurst's camp called him a Chinese Communist", "ruling_headline_slug": "ted-cruz-says-david-dewhursts-camp-called-him-chin", "ruling_link_text": "Red rhymes with Ted", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<em>Austin American-Statesman</em>, news article, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/01152006_aasstorytedcruz.doc\">&quot;In state politics, his star is rising,&quot;</a> Jan. 15, 2006<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTed Cruz campaign, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/10042011_dewhurstcampaignemailspertedcruz.html\">emails</a> from David Dewhurst campaign about Cruz, Oct. 4, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 43, "current_job": "Senator", "false_count": 38, "first_name": "Ted", "half_true_count": 20, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 1475, "last_name": "Cruz", "mostly_true_count": 22, "name_slug": "ted-cruz", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/CRUZPFTNEW.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1475/", "total_count": 141, "true_count": 7, "website": "http://www.tedcruz.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays David Dewhurst accused Cruz of being a Red Chinese Communist.</p>", "statement_context": "a widely distributed email memo.", "statement_date": "2011-10-05", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 149, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/149/", "subject": "Bipartisanship", "subject_slug": "bipartisanship", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "Lieutenant governor", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "David", "half_true_count": 10, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 315, "last_name": "Dewhurst", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "david-dewhurst", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Dewhurstmug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/315/", "total_count": 41, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://www.daviddewhurst.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
