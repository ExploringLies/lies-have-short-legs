President Barack Obama is certainly fond of them. His <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/running-transcript-president-obamas-december-4-remarks-on-the-economy/2013/12/04/7cec31ba-5cff-11e3-be07-006c776266ed_story.html\"><u>recent speech on economic issues</u></a>, in which he backed a minimum wage increase,<strong> </strong>included more than 6,500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about<strong> </strong>a point Obama made in the speech about how the income gap&nbsp;affects young children?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;By the time she turns 3 years old, a child born into a low-income home hears 30 million fewer words than a child from a well-off family, which means by the time she starts school, she&rsquo;s already behind,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just for comparison&rsquo;s sake, 30 million words would be equivalent to 4,615 Obama speeches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But did he get his fact right? We&rsquo;d never heard of this finding before, so we took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked the White House for a source, a spokesman pointed us to <a href=\"http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/spring2003/TheEarlyCatastrophe.pdf\"><u>research</u></a> from the mid&nbsp;1990s and early 2000s by child psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They published their findings in a book, <em><a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/Meaningful_differences_in_the_everyday_e.html?id=I2pHAAAAMAAJ\"><u>Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children</u></a></em>. Over several years, the pair observed families of different socioeconomic statuses, based on education and income levels, and found that better-off families engaged their children more frequently with language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They found a 30 million &quot;word gap&quot; by age 3 between students of divergent socioeconomic classes. That&rsquo;s one piece of evidence, they argued, to explain the &quot;achievement gap,&quot; a term educators and researchers have used to explain why lower-income students start kindergarten on worse footing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The word gap, along with other issues, leaves preschool educators to fix existing educational shortfalls, said Dana Suskind, a doctor and researcher at the University of Chicago. She&rsquo;s also the director of <a href=\"http://tmw.org/tmw-initiative/\"><u>Thirty Million Words Initiative</u></a>, one of many advocacy and research groups whose work revolves around the Hart and Risley research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This early language and vocabulary gap are really the beginnings of the achievement gap that we see continuing on through the end of high school and through life,&quot; Suskind said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama and others often bring up the concept of 30 million words because early childhood exposure to language comes at a crucial time in brain development, said Samuel Odom, a child development researcher at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked if any scientist has called the 30 million word gap into question, Suskind told us it&rsquo;s &quot;pretty well-accepted&quot; as the norm in the field. In addition, she and two other experts agreed that Obama had summed up the research accurately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suskind offered just one caveat: While Obama described the norm, there&rsquo;s variation from family to family. Some low-income families speak to and interact with their kids more, and some more affluent families don&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No socioeconomic group has cornered the market on loving their kids and wanting their kids to succeed,&quot; she said. &quot;You can&rsquo;t generalize economic groups.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama said that less-affluent children are behind by the time they start school because they have heard about 30 million fewer words than peers from higher-income families. Experts say studies clearly support Obama&rsquo;s point. We rate Obama&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Editor&#39;s note: </strong>This item was edited after initial publication to clarify that researchers studied the word gap of children up to age 3, not age 5.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-12-05T16:46:06.730334", "ruling_date": "2013-12-05T17:01:59", "ruling_headline": "Obama says children from low-income families hear 30 million fewer words than peers by age 3", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-says-children-low-income-families-hear-30-mi", "ruling_link_text": "Passes with flying colors", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>American Educator</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/spring2003/TheEarlyCatastrophe.pdf\"><u>The early catastrophe</u></a>,&quot; spring 2003</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Bobby Whithorne, White House spokesman, Dec. 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Elisa Klein, University of Maryland human development professor, Dec. 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Samuel Odom, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill child development director, Dec. 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/the-power-of-talking-to-your-baby/\"><u>The power of talking to your baby</u></a>,&quot; April 10, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Dana Suskind, Thirty Million Words Initiative director and University of Chicago researcher, Dec. 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice University, &quot;<a href=\"http://centerforeducation.rice.edu/slc/LS/30MillionWordGap.html\"><u>The thirty million word gap</u></a>,&quot; accessed Dec. 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saint Paul Public Schools, &quot;<a href=\"http://prek.spps.org/uploads/meaningfuldifferences.pdf\"><u>Meaningful differences in the everyday experience of young American children</u></a>,&quot; accessed Dec. 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slate, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/09/children_s_language_development_talk_and_listen_to_them_from_birth.html\"><u>Baby talk bonanza</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 27, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of Chicago, &quot;<a href=\"http://itm.uchicago.edu/2011/07/29/closing-the-30-million-word-gap/\"><u>Closing the 30 million word gap: a cochlear implant surgeon steps out of the operating room and into the community to better children&rsquo;s language environment</u></a>,&quot; July 29, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/running-transcript-president-obamas-december-4-remarks-on-the-economy/2013/12/04/7cec31ba-5cff-11e3-be07-006c776266ed_story.html\"><u>Full transcript: President Obama&rsquo;s December 4 remarks on the economy</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 4, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;By the time she turns 3 years old, a child born into a low-income home hears 30 million fewer words than a child from a well-off family.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech", "statement_date": "2013-12-04", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 127, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/127/", "subject": "Children", "subject_slug": "children", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>We strive to make our work completely accurate.
