Twenty percent of our electricity currently comes from nuclear power plants. I think there are 104 in the United States, two of them around the coast in California. Very earthquake-resistant, but I guess there could be a tsunami there. It sounds like it&#39;s the tsunami that did the most damage in Japan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;So, on the one hand, it&#39;s impressive how resistant these things are to damage. On the other hand, I do think, as you say, these alarming fears, whether or not they -- certainly if they come to fruition, and let&#39;s hope they don&#39;t -- it&#39;s obviously a setback to nuclear power. And I think it makes even stronger the case for going after natural gas and oil domestically.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered whether Kristol&rsquo;s statistics on electricity generation and the number of nuclear plants were correct -- and we figured our readers would be too. So we looked into it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe first turned to the Statistical Abstract of the United States, a compendium of statistics published by the U.S. Census Bureau. It includes a <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2011/tables/11s0940.pdf\">table</a> summarizing electricity generation by fuel type through 2009. Dividing net electric generation via nuclear power by net generation in the electric power sector as a whole, we get 20.9 percent. That&rsquo;s close enough to Kristol&rsquo;s comment to pass muster with us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext, we turned to the website of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agency has a <a href=\"http://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/reactor/#AlphabeticalList\">page</a> where you can find active nuclear generating facilities on a map and in alphabetical order. We counted them up, and there are exactly 104 sites listed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKristol&rsquo;s only error was in suggesting that there are 104 nuclear power plants; in fact, there are 104 nuclear power reactors. Because many plants have more than one reactor, the actual number of plants is 65. (This list doesn&rsquo;t count military and scientific reactors, which are not overseen by the agency.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, we checked Kristol&#39;s claim about nuclear facilities on the California coast. There are, in fact, two:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/reactor/diab1.html\">Diablo</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/reactor/diab2.html\">Canyon</a>, located 12 miles from San Luis Obispo, and <a href=\"http://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/reactor/sano2.html\">San</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/reactor/sano3.html\">Onofre</a>, located 46 miles from Long Beach.&nbsp;The photographs on the agency&#39;s website clearly show that the plants are located near the water.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Kristol was basically correct, only erring with his mislabeling of &quot;reactors&quot; as &quot;plants.&quot; We rate his statement Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-03-15T17:09:09.877850", "ruling_date": "2011-03-16T11:07:32", "ruling_headline": "Bill Kristol says 20 percent of U.S. electricity comes from nuclear power", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-kristol-says-20-percent-us-electricity-comes-", "ruling_link_text": "Basically right on all three facts", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBill Kristol, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/transcript/joe-cirincione-sen-mitch-mcconnell-crisis-japan-sens-mark-warner-sen-saxby-chambliss-effo?page=4\">interview</a> on Fox News Sunday, March 13, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStatistical Abstract of the United States, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2011/tables/11s0940.pdf\">Table 940</a>: Electricity Net Generation by Sector and Fuel Type, 1990-2009, accessed March 15, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNuclear Regulatory Commission, <a href=\"http://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/reactor/#AlphabeticalList\">main index </a><a href=\"http://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/reactor/#AlphabeticalList\">page</a> for nuclear reactors in the United States, accessed March 15, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCNNMoney.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/13/news/economy/nuclear_power_plants/index.htm\">Japan&#39;s nuclear crisis turns spotlight on U.S. plants</a>,&quot; March 14, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Editor, the Weekly Standard", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Bill ", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Washington, D.C.", "id": 1093, "last_name": "Kristol", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "bill-kristol", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Kristol_mug2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1093/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.weeklystandard.com/author/william-kristol"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Twenty percent of our electricity currently comes from nuclear power plants.
