Did you know that in the capital city of Providence &quot;it&#39;s illegal to sell toothpaste and a toothbrush to the same customer on a Sunday&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither did we.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&#39;s what we were told in a July 14 feature titled &quot;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/h2/fbsp/miniusanotnormal/11-awesome-facts-you-never-knew-about-rhode-island\">11 Awesome Facts You Never Knew About Rhode Island</a>,&quot; listed on the popular news and entertainment website BuzzFeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at PolitiFact, we had two questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First: Is that really true?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second: Who thinks the inability to buy a toothbrush and toothpaste together on a Sunday is awesome?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the uninitiated, BuzzFeed, &nbsp;which regards itself as a legitimate news website, is always trying to take a hot topic and make it hotter. BuzzFeed loves lists. Its July 19, 2013 home page featured &quot;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/chelseamarshall/the-33-fluffiest-animals-on-the-planet\">The 33 Fluffiest Animals On The Planet</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/ellievhall/38-things-catholic-girls-love\">38 Things Catholic Girls Love</a>&quot; (#7 is &quot;Pancakes.&quot; No explanation is offered), and &quot;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/copyranter/13-not-at-all-gratuitous-breast-ads\">14 Not-At-All Gratuitous Breast Ads</a> (Note to BuzzFeed: They ARE gratuitous).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had our doubts about some of the other items on the Rhode Island list. (For example, we couldn&#39;t find any reference in state law to BuzzFeed&#39;s contention that &quot;It is illegal to throw pickle juice on a trolley in Rhode Island.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to focus on the toothbrush claim because we don&#39;t want Providence residents to be at a disadvantage when it comes to dental hygiene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We emailed BuzzFeed and asked for its source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also checked <a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/\">Rhode Island law</a> to see if there was a toothpaste-toothbrush statute that applied to Providence (or any community). We came up with nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also checked the online version of <a href=\"http://library.municode.com/index.aspx?clientId=11458&amp;stateId=39&amp;stateName=Rhode%20Island\">Providence&#39;s city ordinances</a>. We found nada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then we called Providence City Hall and spoke to Deputy City Clerk Lori Hagen, who indulged us and did her own check. She found zip. The ordinances don&#39;t contain any derivative of the word &quot;tooth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it existed, &quot;it would be in the code of ordinances,&quot; Hagen said, adding that she&#39;s never heard of any such restriction. She&#39;s worked for the city for 24 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We thought it might be an old ordinance, repealed long ago. City Archivist Paul Campbell came up with bupkis. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we heard back from BuzzFeed, spokeswoman Augusta Mellon said in an email that a Google search for &quot;sell toothbrush toothpaste sunday rhode island&quot; produced over 8 million hits. (We checked that claim as well. Actual number of hits: about 650, and some of those didn&#39;t even refer to the &quot;law.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mellon said, &quot;There&#39;s multiple accredited sources that have written about it, including the <a href=\"http://blogdailyherald.com/2013/03/13/get-at-me-propo-breaking-ridiculous-ri-laws/\">Brown Daily Herald</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/weird/the-worlds-strangest-laws/story-e6frev20-1111114208087\">Telegraph</a>&quot; in Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The unnamed blogger for the Herald, Brown University&#39;s student newspaper, reported buying both items at a local CVS, insisted that the prohibition was real, and treated the purchase like an act of civil disobedience. The blogger&#39;s source turned out to be a list at DumbLaws.com, which cites no actual law, past or present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least the Telegraph story begins: &quot;Here is a list of the world&#39;s most ridiculous laws or urban myths - we&rsquo;re not quite sure.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BuzzFeed&#39;s Mellon ended her email by saying, &quot;It seems like it&#39;s a commonly referenced piece of information.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She should have added, &quot;Which nobody ever checks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So oral hygiene fans can breathe a minty-fresh sigh of relief. A toothbrush and toothpaste can legally be purchased together any Sunday in Providence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe someday this PolitiFact item will be part of a BuzzFeed list titled &quot;217 Examples of How BuzzFeed Didn&#39;t Check Its Facts.&quot; It&#39;ll be a hot one because we give the website a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">Pants on Fire</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
