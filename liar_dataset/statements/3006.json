Gwen Moore, a four-term Democrat who represents the city, told a Milwaukee weekly newspaper she represents the fourth-poorest congressional district in the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCould that also be true?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoore made the comment in response to a question from the Shepherd Express about whether there was a rift between congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&rsquo;m a congressional Democrat and I don&rsquo;t have any rift with President Obama at all,&quot; Moore said. &quot;I think that he is operating in an entirely different arena than I&rsquo;m dealing in. I represent my constituents in the Fourth Congressional District. I&rsquo;m looking out admittedly for much more narrow interests. I represent the fourth-poorest district (in the nation).&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile the <a href=\"http://gwenmoore.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=399&amp;Itemid=11\">Fourth Congressional </a><a href=\"http://gwenmoore.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=399&amp;Itemid=11\">District</a> encompasses Milwaukee, it also covers a middle-class swath of Milwaukee County that includes West Allis and Cudahy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs it really the fourth-poorest district in the nation?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoore spokesman, David Frey, gave us two replies when we asked for evidence to back up Moore&rsquo;s statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInitially, Frey said Moore based her comment on a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/103929588.html\">article</a> about the census figures released in September. They showed 27 percent of Milwaukee residents lived below the federal poverty level in 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe headline on that story called Milwaukee the nation&rsquo;s fourth-poorest city. However, the first two paragraphs of the article, and a chart that appeared with it, made it clear Milwaukee was the fourth-poorest among big cities -- those with populations above 250,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrey later said Moore misspoke in the Shepherd Express interview, and had meant to say she represents America&rsquo;s fourth-poorest city, not its fourth-poorest congressional district. Frey said Moore has called Milwaukee the nation&rsquo;s fourth-poorest city a number of times.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat explanation doesn&rsquo;t quite stack up, either.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs noted, the city ranked fourth among large cities, behind Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo. Among all <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=y&amp;-state=gct&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_&amp;-_box_head_nbr=GCT1701&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_GCT1701_ST12&amp;-redoLog=true&amp;-_caller=geoselect&amp;-geo_id=&amp;-format=US-33&amp;-_lang=en\">cities</a> covered by the census data -- the comparison Frey said Moore was making -- Milwaukee ranked 46th in poverty.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for the 2009 poverty rates among the nation&rsquo;s 435 <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=y&amp;-state=gct&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_GCT1701_US33&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-_caller=geoselect&amp;-geo_id=&amp;-format=US-44&amp;-_lang=en\">congressional districts</a>, Moore&rsquo;s Milwaukee-based district -- at 25.6 percent -- ranked 18th. The highest rate was 38 percent, in the New York City congressional district that includes the Bronx. That district is represented by Democrat <a href=\"http://serrano.house.gov/Biography.aspx\">Jose Serrano</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s daunting to describe how devastating poverty is in Milwaukee; this item is not aimed at downplaying the city&rsquo;s ranking. But exaggerating it doesn&rsquo;t help, either.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Ald. Michael Murphy recently <a href=\"http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/12/michael-murphy/milwaukee-alderman-michael-murphy-says-mequon-and-/\">claimed</a> the income disparity between the city and suburban Mequon is the highest in the country; and former acting mayor Marvin Pratt, <a href=\"http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/17/marvin-pratt/marvin-pratt-former-acting-mayor-milwaukee-says-bl/\">claimed</a> that black male unemployment in Milwaukee is above 50 percent. We found both assertions False.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoore also overstates the case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHer spokesman said Moore meant to say Milwaukee is the nation&rsquo;s fourth-poorest city, not that her district is the nation&rsquo;s fourth-poorest congressional district. But even that ranking is correct only when considering the nation&rsquo;s largest cities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Moore&rsquo;s statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-12-29T18:25:30.022194", "ruling_date": "2011-01-03T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Rep.
