Paul Ryan&rsquo;s role as a potential deal-maker on immigration reform has drawn criticism from the <a href=\"http://www.fairus.org/news/time-for-answers-from-paul-ryan\">Federation for American Immigration Reform</a>, which opposes legal status for illegal immigrants and wants to reduce legal immigration to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group questions why Ryan, the Janesville Republican, would welcome more foreign laborers to America at a time when unemployment remains stubbornly high in Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Does Congressman Ryan think Wisconsin workers aren&rsquo;t good enough to get the job done?&quot; the group asks in a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REzmlj6wdLE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">TV ad</a>. The group fleshed out its complaint in an August 5, 2013 <a href=\"http://www.fairus.org/news/time-for-answers-from-paul-ryan\">news release</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Congressman Ryan needs to explain to thousands of Wisconsin workers, who are struggling to find jobs to support their families, why he wants to increase immigration in order to avert a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/paul-ryan-immigration-93048.html\">labor shortage</a> that clearly does not exist,&quot; said FAIR president Dan Stein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then came this claim:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ryan&#39;s advocacy for amnesty and immigration increases has intensified as <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/local/216794671.html\">unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin</a>. In June, unemployment increased in 30 of the state&#39;s 32 largest cities and in 56 of the state&#39;s 72 counties.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those don&rsquo;t sound like good numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Gov. Scott Walker has touted a declining statewide unemployment rate. And the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that June&rsquo;s private-sector job gain was the largest month-to-month increase since 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What gives?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2013/aug/04/words-audience-matter-politically-sensitive-immigr/\">we reported</a> in an August 5, 2013 item, Ryan is open to granting legal status and eventually citizenship to those who came here illegally, if they get in &quot;back of the line,&quot; pay penalties and jump through other hoops over a 15-year period. He wants border security tackled first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this item, we won&rsquo;t evaluate whether &quot;amnesty&quot; is the proper description of what Ryan supports. The word means different things to different people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we&rsquo;ll examine whether &quot;unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin&quot; as Ryan stepped up his consensus-building efforts in the House, as the group claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A look at the numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no dispute that unemployment rates still reflect widespread joblessness lingering after the Great Recession, with 210,000 people still unemployed in June 2013. FAIR&rsquo;s larger point is well taken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But FAIR says things are getting worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group refers to a time period when Ryan&rsquo;s advocacy &quot;intensified&quot;, and cites the June unemployment figures in claiming that unemployment has been &quot;on the rise throughout Wisconsin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s accurate to say, as FAIR did in backing up its claim, that unemployment increased in 30 of the state&#39;s 32 largest cities and in 56 of the state&#39;s 72 counties in June when compared to the previous month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Janesville, for example, saw its rate rise from 8.5 percent to 9.0 percent. Milwaukee rose from 9.9 to 10.6 percent. The figures, which are estimates, were reported by the state&rsquo;s workforce development agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data supports the group&rsquo;s claim if you interpret &quot;throughout Wisconsin&quot; as a geographical reference. Unemployment rose in most counties, and nearly all major municipalities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s one inconvenient fact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June, the statewide unemployment rate actually dropped from 7.0 percent to 6.8 percent despite the negative news in many local communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can that be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The figures are estimates drawn from a small sample, so the local numbers are less reliable than the statewide figure, noted Laura Dresser, a labor economist and associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy. The size of the changes in different communities influences the bottom line, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I would say it is most responsible to watch any of these trends over time -- i.e. statewide unemployment ticking mostly but very slowly down -- or to watch the trend in municipalities over a long horizon as well,&quot; Dresser told us. &quot;Only when you see month after month moving the same directions can you really think of it as a trend.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the matter of the time frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s reasonable to say that Ryan&rsquo;s public role &quot;intensified&quot; in June and July -- before and after the Senate passed its version of immigration reform. And as FAIR noted, the latest unemployment stats are from June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Ryan was revving up his push back in May. He barnstormed Wisconsin early that month, pushing for reform. A Journal Sentinel article at the time noted Ryan &quot;has plunged into the fray, using his stature with conservatives to promote a sweeping bipartisan compromise in Congress.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The time frame matters because the unemployment rate increase in June was not the norm for 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statewide unemployment rate has nudged up and down for the last year, settling in June at 6.8 percent, below the U.S. rate of 7.6 percent. (Wisconsin&rsquo;s rate is down from the recession&rsquo;s 9.2 percent peak in 2009).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, notably, rates in larger municipalities and counties have been on a roller coaster in 2013, rising in some months, falling in others, state data shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May, for example, 24 of the 32 largest municipalities saw a rate decrease, as did all counties but two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the claim of an unemployment rate &quot;on the rise&quot; is true only if we&rsquo;re talking about a one-month trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, what about the part of the claim that Ryan favors &quot;immigration increases?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan has told interviewers that fixing the legal immigration system now could help solve future labor shortages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Not now, but in the future we&#39;re going to have labor shortages,&quot; Ryan <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/06/19/paul_ryan_defends_immigration_bill_were_going_to_have_labor_shortages_in_the_future.html\">said</a> on The Laura Ingraham Show, June 19, 2013. &quot;We have 10,000 people retiring each and every day in America when the Baby Boomers retire. We are not like Europe, we&#39;re not like Japan in that our birthrates are really low, but they&#39;re not high enough. Immigration, in a decade or so, can help us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FAIR says &quot;unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin&quot; as Ryan stepped up advocacy of &quot;immigration increases.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group chose its words pretty carefully, clearly focusing on Ryan&rsquo;s recent actions and the corresponding -- and overwhelmingly negative -- unemployment trend in most major municipalities and many counties in the most recent month. And it&rsquo;s true Ryan is endorsing &quot;immigration increases.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But saying the rate &quot;has been on the rise&quot; suggests more than a one-month trend -- and there is no such trend in recent months. And for that one month, statewide unemployment in June fell, not rose, undercutting FAIR&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s an element of truth here, but some critical facts create a different impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s our definition of Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-08-07T21:46:30.386645", "ruling_date": "2013-08-09T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Group says Wisconsin jobless rate was on the rise while Paul Ryan advocated for immigration increases", "ruling_headline_slug": "group-says-wisconsin-jobless-rate-was-rise-while-p", "ruling_link_text": "Still high, but actually nudged down statewide in June", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>FAIR web site <a href=\"http://www.fairus.org/news/time-for-answers-from-paul-ryan\">press release</a>, Aug. 5, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Ira Mehlman, media director, Federation for American Immigration Reform, Aug. 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minneapolis Star-Tribune,<a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/local/216794671.html\"> &quot;Unemployment rates increase in most Wisconsin cities, counties in June,&quot;</a> July 24, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/private-sector-employment-rose-13800-in-june-state-says-b9957123z1-216042101.html\"> &quot;Private-sector employment rose 13,800 in June, state says,&quot;</a> July 18, 201</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s Worknet,<a href=\"http://worknet.wisconsin.gov/worknet/worknetinfo.aspx?htm=map_uRatesCo&amp;menuselection=gp\"> Wisconsin County Unemployment Rates,</a> June 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development,<a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/newsreleases/2013/unemployment/130724_june_local.pdf\"> press release</a> on local unemployment rates, July 24, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development,<a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/newsreleases/2013/unemployment/130626_may_local.pdf\"> press release</a> on local unemployment rates, June 26, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development,<a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/newsreleases/2013/unemployment/130522_april_local.pdf\"> press release</a> on local unemployment rates, May 22, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development,<a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/newsreleases/2013/unemployment/130424_march_local.pdf\"> press release</a> on local unemployment rates, April 24, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development,<a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/newsreleases/2013/unemployment/130320_january_local.pdf\"> press release</a> on local unemployment rates, March 20, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development,<a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/newsreleases/2012/unemployment/130123_december_local.pdf\"> press release</a> on local unemployment rates, January 23, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development,<a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/newsreleases/2012/unemployment/120725_june_local.pdf\"> press release</a> on local unemployment rates, July 25, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 1031, "last_name": "Federation for American Immigration Reform", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "federation-american-immigration-reform", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PolitiFact_silhouettes_6.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1031/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin&quot; as Paul Ryan stepped up his advocacy of &quot;immigration increases.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a news release", "statement_date": "2013-08-05", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>Amnesty,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">self-deportation</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/donald-trump-mexico-immigration-presidential-campaign\">wall</a>.
