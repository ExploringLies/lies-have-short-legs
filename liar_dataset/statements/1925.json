The issue will appear on the November ballot.</p>\r\n<p>One question many voters want answered: How much will the new tax cost me?</p>\r\n<p>In a brochure outlining how rapid transit can boost the economy and ease traffic congestion, Hillsborough Area Regional Transit says the tax will cost the average family $12 a month.</p>\r\n<p>That figure comes from the Hillsborough County Metropolitan Planning Organization&rsquo;s long-range transportation plan. It puts the cost of a 1 cent sales tax for the average family at $142 a year, and the average for a single person at $85 a year.</p>\r\n<p>The MPO came up with those numbers by plugging the county&rsquo;s household incomes into the IRS sales tax deduction calculator, available on the agency&rsquo;s Web site. The IRS developed the calculator because tax rules allow people to deduct either&nbsp;sales taxes paid annually or state income tax from their federal returns, and the calculator enables them to arrive at a&nbsp;reasonable estimate without having to save a basket of receipts.</p>\r\n<p>MPO planner Beth Alden said she used average household income rather than median income. &ldquo;The number we&rsquo;ve been using is the higher one, just to be more conservative,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n<p>The county&rsquo;s average family of three has a household income of $77,852, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. A single household&rsquo;s average income is $44,832.</p>\r\n<p>We plugged those figures into the IRS calculator and it showed the average family would pay $141.83 a year in local sales tax, which currently is 1 percent. A single person would pay $91.50. <br />That&rsquo;s virtually the same as the MPO estimates.</p>\r\n<p>The figure does not include sales taxes on major purchases, such as cars, mobile homes or construction materials for a house. Those are listed separately on tax returns. The county sales tax on items worth more than $5,000 is capped, meaning the maximum amount paid on any single item would be $50.</p>\r\n<p>But how accurate is the IRS calculator?</p>\r\n<p>Skeptical observers say it spits out a low figure.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the IRS&rsquo; interest to have that on the lower end, obviously, to decrease the deductions,&rdquo; said Rusty Spoor, a tax accountant at Foley &amp; Lardner. He guessed the calculator could be as much as 30 percent off.</p>\r\n<p>Like other tax experts, he noted it&rsquo;s impossible to determine exactly how much people pay a year in sales taxes without saving receipts, so the IRS calculator is a useful tool.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best of the poorest options,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that number&rsquo;s great, but it&rsquo;s the best starting point.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The calculator is based on spending patterns captured in the Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted annually by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, IRS spokesperson Florida Mike Dobzinski said.</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the best method for calculating how much people pay in sales tax, according to Frank Williams, chief economist for the Florida Department of Revenue&rsquo;s Office of Tax Research.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It should be fairly close,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It may understate it by 2 to 5 percent, but that&rsquo;s just a gut feel.&rdquo; <br />Opponents of the sales tax say it will cost residents much more than the MPO estimates.</p>\r\n<p>Jim Hosler, a demographer running for Hillsborough County commissioner, initially figured it would cost households nearly $400 a year.</p>\r\n<p>He came up with that number by dividing the estimated revenue from the tax &mdash; about $174 million, according to the Florida Legislative Committee on Intergovernmental Relations &mdash; by 454,000, the approximate number of households in Hillsborough County.</p>\r\n<p>That comes about $383.</p>\r\n<p>Trouble is, residents aren&rsquo;t the only ones who pay sales taxes. Tourists, commuters and businesses also pay them. Experts say there&rsquo;s no way to know exactly who pays what, but most estimate that non-residents bear about 20 percent of the tax burden. Under that calculation, the cost is $307 per household.</p>\r\n<p>But that spreads out sales taxes equally among all households, regardless of income. And a household that earns $200,000 a year will pay much more in sales taxes than a $20,000 household, simply by virtue of having more disposable income.</p>\r\n<p>Hosler concedes his number may be high. &ldquo;But their number is definitely a low number,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The real number is probably somewhere in between.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Clearly there are a number of ways to calculate the figure, and the result for all of them is a somewhat imprecise.</p>\r\n<p>Still, our research shows that the number in the brochure is very close to the one provided by the MPO, and HART used a recognized, legitimate source in coming up with the figure.&nbsp;The IRS calculation, while perhaps on the low side, is a recognized standard. So we rate the statement Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-18T17:42:18.710009", "ruling_date": "2010-06-18T17:33:40", "ruling_headline": "Brochure estimates financial impact of Hillsborough transit tax ", "ruling_headline_slug": "brochure-estimates-financial-impact-hillsborough-t", "ruling_link_text": "It's a guestimate, but they all are ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>HART Rapid Transit Solutions for Hillsborough County <a href=\"http://www.gohart.org/whytransit/rapid_transit_solutions.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">brochure</a></p>\r\n<p>Hillsborough County Metropolitan Planning <a href=\"http://www.mpo2035.org/faqs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Organization 2035 Plan</a></p>\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_DP3YR3&amp;-geo_id=05000US12057&amp;-gc_url=&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_&amp;-_lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Hillsborough economic characteristics</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Interview with Beth Alden, June 14, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Internal Revenue Service <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">sales tax deduction calculator</a></p>\r\n<p>Interview with IRS spokesperson Florida Mike Dobzinski, June 14, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Interview with Rusty Spoor, tax attorney with Foley &amp; Lardner, June 15, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Interview with Frank Williams, Florida Department of Revenue, Office of Tax Research</p>\r\n<p>Interview with Jim Hosler, June 14, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Interview with Matt Gardner, Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington, DC<br />Florida Legislative Committee on <a href=\"http://www.floridalcir.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Intergovernmental Relations</a></p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 463, "last_name": "Hillsborough Area Regional Transit", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "hillsborough-area-rapid-transit-hart", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mug-independentgroup__________________.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/463/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p><span lang=\"EN\">\r\n<p>The addition of a 1 percent sales tax would cost a typical household in Hillsborough County approximately $12 a month.</p>\r\n</span></p>", "statement_context": "a brochure  ", "statement_date": "2010-06-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 133, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/133/", "subject": "Infrastructure", "subject_slug": "infrastructure", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 144, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/144/", "subject": "Urban", "subject_slug": "urban", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
