His company was manufacturing tires in China when he said an employee conspired with Shandong Linglong, &quot;to steal our copyrighted blueprints and make low-quality knock-off tires,&quot; Fishman wrote in an <a href=\"http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/20850490-95/my-turn-ted-cruz-chose-money-over-american-values\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Op-ed published in the Concord Monitor</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fishman won the suit and was awarded $26 million in damages in 2010, according to federal court records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Chinese company appealed and hired the Washington D.C. law firm Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, where Cruz was a partner.
