The reason for the &quot;mostly&quot; qualifier is that companies aren&rsquo;t actually taxed at the statutory rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions, and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits. So economists often look at what they call the effective tax rate, which experts have told us is just as valid a measurement of corporate tax rates as the statutory rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But whereas the statutory rate is relatively straightforward and uncontroversial, different, reputable organizations have published very different estimates of the effective tax rate that corporations pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most recent estimate comes from the <a href=\"http://www.doingbusiness.org/~/media/GIAWB/Doing%20Business/Documents/Special-Reports/Paying-Taxes-2014.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>World Bank and International Finance Commission</u></a>, which put the United States&rsquo; effective rate for 2014 at 27.9 percent. That&rsquo;s second-highest behind New Zealand among OECD countries and 15th-highest among the 189 countries measured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, the Tax Foundation published a <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/docs/sr195.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>survey</u></a> of 13 prior estimates of the United States&rsquo; effective tax rate from 2005 to 2011. All 13 studies pegged the U.S.&rsquo;s rate as above average, but none had the U.S. rate first overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another 2011 study by the Congressional Research Service put the U.S. effective rate at 27.1 percent, slightly lower than the OECD average of 27.7 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Taxes are convoluted</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different studies disagree on effective corporate tax rates because corporate tax rates tend to vary widely depending on the industry, said Alan Viola, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The biggest deduction that varies across countries is how generous the depreciation schedule is,&quot; said Alan Viard, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. &quot;When a business does an investment, equipment, a building, they don&rsquo;t normally get to deduct the whole cost that year. They have to do it over time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faster is better, said Viard, but depreciation rates vary depending on what types of equipment a company is buying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many studies also don&rsquo;t account for what the United States classifies as S-corporations, meaning businesses that pay tax through the individual income-tax system rather than the corporate income-tax system, Viard said. This represents about 30 percent of American companies, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So while effective tax rates are a good estimate of the corporate tax burden in the United States, particular businesses&rsquo; burden may vary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bolling said the United States has &quot;the highest corporate tax rate in the free world.&quot; He was referring to the statutory rate, meaning the rate before deductions. On that score, he&rsquo;s right: The United States does have the highest statutory rate among developed countries. However, the United States&rsquo; corporate tax rate doesn&rsquo;t appear to be the highest once deductions and other exclusions are taken into account. So Bolling is correct by one valid definition. Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-09-05T16:45:10.550389", "ruling_date": "2014-09-09T11:01:09", "ruling_headline": "Does the U.S. have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-us-have-highest-corporate-tax-rate-free-world", "ruling_link_text": "Officially, U.S. rate is high, though firms usually pay less", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Eric Bolling on <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/the-five/transcript/2014/09/02/us-economy-better-under-president-obama\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Five</u><u>,</u></a> Sept. 1, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericbolling/status/507231442653708288\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>@ericbolling</u></a>, Sept. 3, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Alan Viard, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, Sept. 3, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax Foundation, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/docs/sr195.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;U.S. Corporations Suffer High Effective Tax Rates by International Standards,&quot;</u></a> September 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>World Bank Group, <a href=\"http://www.doingbusiness.org/~/media/GIAWB/Doing%20Business/Documents/Special-Reports/Paying-Taxes-2014.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Paying Taxes 2014,&quot;</u></a> Nov. 19, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Ohio, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/nov/28/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-us-has-second-highest-corpora/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Sen.
