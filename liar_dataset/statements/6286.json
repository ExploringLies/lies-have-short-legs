Bain Capital is Romney&rsquo;s former company, which has been the target of accusations that it outsourced jobs, closed factories and reaped huge profits for itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Do you think that it is accidental that the name of the really vicious fire-breathing, four-eyed whatever it is villain in this movie is named Bane?&quot; Limbaugh suggested to his listeners.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can see our serious fact checks about Bain Capital <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/jul/17/fact-checking-attacks-about-bain-romney/\">here</a>. For now, we thought we&rsquo;d take a pop-culture diversion from politics to the comic book underworld to see if Limbaugh has really uncovered an evil plot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>What he said</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2012/07/17/the_batman_campaign\">the transcript</a> of Limbaugh&rsquo;s July 17, 2012, show:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;This evil villain in the new Batman movie is named Bane. And there&#39;s now a discussion out there as to whether or not this is purposeful and whether or not it will influence voters. It&#39;s gonna have a lot of people. This movie, the audience is gonna be huge. A lot of people are gonna see the movie, and it&#39;s a lot of brain-dead people, entertainment, the pop culture crowd, and they&#39;re gonna hear Bane in the movie and they&#39;re gonna associate Bain. The thought is that when they start paying attention to the campaign later in the year, and Obama and the Democrats keep talking about Bain, Romney and Bain, that these people will think back to the Batman movie, &lsquo;Oh, yeah, I know who that is.&rsquo; There are some people who think it&#39;ll work. Others think you&#39;re really underestimating the American people to think that will work.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe wrapped up:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;You may think it&#39;s ridiculous, I&#39;m just telling you this is the kind of stuff the Obama team is lining up. The kind of people who would draw this comparison are the kind of people that they are campaigning to. These are the kind of people that they are attempting to appeal to.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>A short history of Bane</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo listen up, brain-dead people. To learn more about this villain, we consulted scholarly sources such as <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=2JTO9IaCKbkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP21&amp;dq=Bane+batman+&amp;ots=g_1ODfGNCk&amp;sig=OOiYU_ThnXxmCXSVhkv5ZsZtbEU#v=onepage&amp;q=Bane%20batman&amp;f=false\">The Essential Batman Encyclopedia</a>, and <a href=\"http://io9.com/5926874/the-batman-villain-bane-is-a-conspiracy-against-mitt-romney-hypothesizes-rush-limbaugh\">io9</a>, a site that covers science, science fiction and the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBane, the encyclopedia tells us, was born in the fictional South American country of Santa Prisca and grew up in prison, forced to serve a sentence for the crimes of his father. He grows into a violent genius, who commits murder at age 8 and acquires superhuman strength after surviving experiments with a drug called Venom, which left him impossibly virile but forever reliant on the drug. The tentacled mask he wears connects to pumps that deliver regular doses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He eventually breaks out of prison, bound for Gotham City, where he plans to overpower Batman and assume power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA compelling personal history, to be sure. But the bottom line is this: Bane entered the Batman storyline in 1993. That&rsquo;s more than a decade before Romney first ran for president in 2007.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThink Bane creator Chuck Dixon had that much foresight? He doesn&rsquo;t.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Ridiculous,&quot; is what Dixon called suggestions of a connection between his character and Romney&rsquo;s company.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDixon responded <a href=\"http://dixonverse.net/board3/index.php?topic=7474.0\">on his message board</a> to the notion, <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/romneys-new-foe-batmans-bane/article/2502274\">first raised by a Democrat</a>, that the two story lines are linked.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I saw it on FB like two hours ago,&quot; Dixon wrote. &quot;Ridiculous. Tho&#39; I got a cold feeling in the pit of my stomach that Rush may pick up on this. And (that) would be the <em>second </em>time he pegged me and (co-creator) Graham (Nolan) as liberals on his show.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLimbaugh hadn&rsquo;t yet weighed in, but Dixon showed his crafty knack for foreshadowing. He&rsquo;s no liberal -- he identifies as a conservative.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot that he minds the publicity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Overgrasping Dems? Hey, if it gets Obama supporters into theaters. Maybe they&#39;ll buy thousands of Bane toys to throw at Romney. It all adds to MY Bane capital. I wonder if the Romney campaign will contact me?&quot; Dixon wrote.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe&rsquo;ve also read several commentaries that find a more obvious parallel between the wealthy Romney and the Bruce Wayne character, a proverbial 1-percenter. <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/watercooler/2012/jul/16/picket-obama-camp-miscasts-batman-characters-romne/\">In one trailer</a>, Catwoman echoes the Occupy Wall Street movement, telling Wayne, &quot;There&#39;s a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches. Because when it hits, you&#39;re all going to wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDixon too saw more parallels between Batman and Romney, <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5927095/bane-creator-chuck-dixon-limbaughs-batman-conspiracy-theory-ridiculous--im-a-staunch-conservative\">telling a call-in radio show</a>, &quot;Bane is a force for evil and the destruction of the status quo. He&#39;s far more akin to an Occupy Wall Street-type if you&#39;re looking to cast him politically. And if there ever was a Bruce Wayne running for the White House it would have to be Romney.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nLimbaugh suggested it&rsquo;s no accident that in a movie coming out four months before the presidential election, the villain bears the same name as the company formerly run by Romney and now being attacked by Democrats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn politics, conspiracies are everywhere if you look hard enough. But Limbaugh&rsquo;s superpowers of persuasion can&rsquo;t make this theory stand up. The villainous Bane first appeared in Batman comic books in 1993, long before Romney entered presidential politics. Even the character&rsquo;s creator called a suggested link &quot;ridiculous.&quot; We rate this statement Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-18T16:14:29.318620", "ruling_date": "2012-07-18T17:05:09", "ruling_headline": "Rush Limbaugh claims link between Batman\u2019s Bane and Romney\u2019s Bain", "ruling_headline_slug": "rush-limbaugh-claims-link-between-batmans-bane-and", "ruling_link_text": "'Ridiculous,' Bane creator says", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=2JTO9IaCKbkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP21&amp;dq=Bane+batman+&amp;ots=g_1ODfGNCk&amp;sig=OOiYU_ThnXxmCXSVhkv5ZsZtbEU#v=onepage&amp;q=Bane%20batman&amp;f=false\">The Essential Batman Encyclopedia</a>, pages 16-17, accessed July 18, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRushLimbaugh.com, July 17, 2012 <a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2012/07/17/the_batman_campaign\">show transcript</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Washington Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/watercooler/2012/jul/16/picket-obama-camp-miscasts-batman-characters-romne/\">PICKET: Batman villain creator reacts to character&#39;s comparison to Romney - &#39;Ridiculous&#39;..&#39;Overgrasping Dems,&#39;</a>&quot; July 16, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDixonverse.net <a href=\"http://dixonverse.net/board3/index.php?topic=7474.15\">message board</a>, accessed July 18, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://popwatch.ew.com/2012/07/17/batman-bane-romney-bain-lets-call-the-whole-thing-off/\">Does Batman&#39;s Bane = Mitt Romney&#39;s Bain?</a>&quot; July 17, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSlate, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/07/17/the_creator_of_the_new_batman_villain_thinks_you_re_an_idiot_if_you_compare_him_to_romney.html\">The Creator of the New* Batman Villain Thinks You&#39;re an Idiot if You Compare Him to Romney</a>,&quot; July 17, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/rush-limbaugh-claims-new-batman-movie-is-liberal-attack-on-romney/2012/07/17/gJQAbHY0rW_story.html?socialreader_check=0&amp;denied=1\">Rush Limbaugh claims &lsquo;Dark Knight&rsquo; movie is liberal attack on Romney</a>,&quot; July 17, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGawker, &quot;<a href=\"http://gawker.com/5927095/bane-creator-chuck-dixon-limbaughs-batman-conspiracy-theory-ridiculous--im-a-staunch-conservative\">Bane Creator Chuck Dixon: Limbaugh&rsquo;s Batman Conspiracy Theory &lsquo;Ridiculous&rsquo; &mdash; I&rsquo;m a Staunch Conservative</a>,&quot; July 18, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nio9.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://io9.com/5926874/the-batman-villain-bane-is-a-conspiracy-against-mitt-romney-hypothesizes-rush-limbaugh\">The Batman villain Bane is a conspiracy against Mitt Romney, hypothesizes Rush Limbaugh</a>,&quot; July 17, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 10, "current_job": "Radio host", "false_count": 12, "first_name": "Rush", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "", "id": 156, "last_name": "Limbaugh", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "rush-limbaugh", "pants_count": 10, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/rush_limbaugh6.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/156/", "total_count": 39, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says it&#39;s not &quot;accidental&quot; that the villain in the Batman movie is named Bane.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "his syndicated radio show", "statement_date": "2012-07-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 52, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/52/", "subject": "Pop Culture", "subject_slug": "pop-culture", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 104, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/104/", "subject": "Pundits", "subject_slug": "pundits", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
