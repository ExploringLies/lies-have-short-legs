It was a terrible deal, and it really led to the destruction of the company.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Honestly, Mr. Trump, I find it quite rich that you would talk about this,&quot; Fiorina shot back, with her own laundry list of Trump&rsquo;s failings as as businessman. (We address one of her claims in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/21/carly-fiorina/trumps-four-bankruptcies/\">separate fact-check</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump and Fiorina both talk up their private-sector experience as proof of presidential acumen, so we were curious about Trump&rsquo;s claim that Fiorina&rsquo;s business record is exaggerated. The Trump campaign didn&rsquo;t get back to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Compaq merger</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiorina has repeatedly claimed that she doubled the size of HP, referring to the revenues created by the company. But, as Trump says and as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/10/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-fights-back-against-hp-layoff-claims/\">we</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2015/05/08/carly-fiorinas-misleading-claims-about-her-business-record/\">other</a> <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2015/05/fiorinas-selective-record-at-hp/\">fact-checkers</a> have noted, this growth largely stems from the company&rsquo;s controversial merger with Compaq.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Fiorina&rsquo;s direction and after an embittered proxy war, HP <a href=\"http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=230610#.Vfr08xFVhBc\">bought</a> Compaq for $25 billion in 2002, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/04/business/hewlett-packard-in-deal-to-buy-compaq-for-25-billion-in-stock.html\">a bold move</a>&quot; to make the two struggling companies more competitive and in a position to take on then-industry giant IBM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2001, HP reported a net revenue of <a href=\"http://hsprod.investis.com/shared/v2/irwizard/sec_item_new.jsp?epic=hewlett_packard&amp;ipage=1583226&amp;DSEQ=&amp;SEQ=&amp;SQDESC=\">$45.2 billion</a> and Compaq <a href=\"http://hsprod.investis.com/shared/v2/irwizard/sec_item_new.jsp?epic=hewlett_packard&amp;ipage=1584450&amp;DSEQ=1&amp;SEQ=14&amp;SQDESC=SECTION_PAGE\">$33.6 billion</a>, according their Securities and Exchange Commission filings, for a combined revenue of $78.8 billion. This may look like growth but, according to experts, it&rsquo;s inflated and inorganic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Revenues will obviously go up after a merger so the real question is whether revenues grew after accounting for the combined revenues of HP and Compaq. Here, this is little to support Carly&#39;s statement,&quot; said Kartik Hosanagar, a professor at the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2004, Fiorina&rsquo;s last full year as CEO, total revenues for the merged company were $80 billion. In other words, &quot;revenues barely grew during that period,&quot; Hosanagar said. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiorina is by no means the first executive to take credit for revenue increases spurred by a merger, pointed out Steve Morrissette, a professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. Still, he said, claiming it as growth is &quot;disingenuous.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A &lsquo;terrible deal&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that HP has not been &quot;destroyed&quot; -- it&rsquo;s alive and kicking, but the question of the merger&rsquo;s long-term impact on the company remains somewhat unsettled, even more than a decade after the deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the merger was published on Sept. 4 , 2001, HP stock prices plummeted, and fell again when the deal was completed on May 3, 2002. It resulted in <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/17/barbara-boxer/ad-sen-barbara-boxer-attacks-carly-fiorina-layoffs/\">30,000 layoffs</a>, Fiorina&rsquo;s ousting, a low profit margin (<a href=\"http://hsprod.investis.com/shared/v2/irwizard/sec_item_new.jsp?epic=hewlett_packard&amp;ipage=3849183&amp;DSEQ=&amp;SEQ=&amp;SQDESC=\">$2.4 billion</a> in 2004, less than 5 percent of the revenues), and lower stock prices. (Fiorina, for her part, has maintained that this is due to the dot-com bubble burst rather than her leadership or the merger.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This was a big bet that didn&rsquo;t pay off, that didn&rsquo;t even come close to attaining what Fiorina and HP&rsquo;s board said was in store,&quot; veteran financial journalist Carol Loomis <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2011/08/21/why-carlys-big-bet-is-failing-fortune-classics-2005/\">wrote in <em>Fortune</em> in 2005</a>. Dell&rsquo;s CEO famously called the merger &quot;the dumbest deal of the decade.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, however, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-05-04/brilliant-or-blunder-a-rashomon-roundtable-on-carly-fiorina-s-compaq-acquisition\">some industries watchers</a> have come to view the merger in a better light. The Fiorina campaign forwarded PolitiFact several <a href=\"http://www.crn.com/news/mobility/231601009/the-hp-compaq-merger-partners-reflect-10-years-later.htm\">reports</a> <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_14819426?nclick_check=1\">and</a> <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/h-ps-only-true-growth-is-a-carly-fiorina-legacy-2015-08-20\">columns</a> hailing the deal as an ultimate boon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hewlett-Packard Co.&rsquo;s fiscal third quarter earnings showed a decline in nearly all of its businesses, with one exception: industry standard servers, a segment area that grew in part as a result of H-P&rsquo;s much-maligned merger with Compaq Computer in 2002,&quot; according to a column published in August 2015 in the financial news site MarketWatch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the &quot;success&quot; camp, however, is a <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_14922854?nclick_check=1\">substantial number of analysts</a> who say much of the credit should go to the man who replaced Fiorina as CEO, Mark Hurd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ultimately, it turned out to be a good move,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/compaq-hp-ultimately-urge-merge-was-right\">said</a> Robert Burgelman, a professor at the Stanford School of Business who has studied the merger at length. &quot;But although the logic of the merger was correct, executing it was difficult. ...Hurd accomplished what Fiorina couldn&#39;t.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/14/carly-fiorina-president-2/\">many</a> <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_14938915?nclick_check=1\">experts</a> don&rsquo;t buy the notion of Fiorina&rsquo;s foresight or the brilliance of the merger. Morrissette of the Chicago Business School pointed out that HP is currently <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/07/01/hewlett-packard-filing-split/\">splitting</a> into two companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Time did not show the merger to be a success,&quot; he said. &quot;Most analysts do not consider HP a success story. The company has continued to struggle.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;When Carly says the revenues went up, that&#39;s because she bought Compaq. It was a terrible deal, and it really led to the destruction of the company.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the HP-Compaq merger was almost universally condemned at the time the deal took place, time has made the merger look better in the minds of some.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s no question that the growth in HP&rsquo;s revenue did indeed come from its 2002 merger with Compaq. That means it&rsquo;s not organic growth, but rather merely due to increase in the volume of the combined company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-09-21T11:37:20.043495", "ruling_date": "2015-09-21T15:16:41", "ruling_headline": "Fact-checking Donald Trump's attack on Carly Fiorina's record at Hewlett-Packard ", "ruling_headline_slug": "fact-checking-donald-trumps-attack-carly-fiorinas-", "ruling_link_text": "Two companies, double the revenue", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Leslie Shedd, spokesperson for Carly for America, Sept. 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Kartik Hosanagar, professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Sept. 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Stephen Morrissette, professor at the Booth School of the University of Chicago, Sept. 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Steve Kaufman, senior lecture at the Harvard Business School, Sept. 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/16/annotated-transcript-september-16-gop-debate/#\">Wednesday&rsquo;s GOP debate transcript, annotated</a>,&quot; Sept. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/13/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-yale-laws-top-man-criticized-for/\">Donald Trump says Yale Law&#39;s &#39;top man&#39; criticized former HP CEO Carly Fiorina</a>,&quot; Sept. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/10/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-fights-back-against-hp-layoff-claims/\">Carly Fiorina fights back against HP layoff claims, says she doubled size of company</a>,&quot; May 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2015/05/08/carly-fiorinas-misleading-claims-about-her-business-record/\">Carly Fiorina&rsquo;s misleading claims about her business record</a>,&quot; May 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FactCheck.Org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2015/05/fiorinas-selective-record-at-hp/\">Fiorina&rsquo;s Selective Record at HP</a>,&quot; May 15, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/04/business/hewlett-packard-in-deal-to-buy-compaq-for-25-billion-in-stock.html\">Hewlett-Packard in Deal to Buy Compaq for $25 Billion in Stock</a>,&quot; Sept. 4, 2001</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hewlett-Packard, &quot;<a href=\"http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=230610#.Vfwqs99VhBd\">Hewlett-Packard and Compaq agree to merge, creating $87 billion global technology leader</a>,&quot; Sept. 3, 2001</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/upshot/fiorina-grew-hewlett-packards-sales-but-not-its-profits.html?_r=0\">Fiorina Increased Hewlett-Packard&rsquo;s Sales, but Not Its Profits</a>, Sept. 18, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hewlett-Packard, <a href=\"http://hsprod.investis.com/shared/v2/irwizard/sec_item_new.jsp?epic=hewlett_packard&amp;ipage=1583226&amp;DSEQ=&amp;SEQ=&amp;SQDESC=\">Annual Report</a>, Jan. 29, 2002</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hewlett-Packard, <a href=\"http://hsprod.investis.com/shared/v2/irwizard/sec_item_new.jsp?epic=hewlett_packard&amp;ipage=1584450&amp;DSEQ=1&amp;SEQ=14&amp;SQDESC=SECTION_PAGE\">Annual Report</a>, Jan. 30, 2002</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hewlett-Packard, <a href=\"http://hsprod.investis.com/shared/v2/irwizard/sec_item_new.jsp?epic=hewlett_packard&amp;ipage=3849183&amp;DSEQ=&amp;SEQ=&amp;SQDESC=\">Annual Report</a>, Dec. 21, 2005</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Fortune</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2011/08/21/why-carlys-big-bet-is-failing-fortune-classics-2005/\">Why Carly&#39;s big bet is failing</a>,&quot; Feb. 7, 2005</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/THE-HP-COMPAQ-MERGER-Those-who-lost-their-HP-2650845.php\">The HP-Compaq Merger</a>,&quot; May 4, 2003</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-05-04/brilliant-or-blunder-a-rashomon-roundtable-on-carly-fiorina-s-compaq-acquisition\">Brilliant, or Blunder?
