Loretta Sanchez to replace retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer in November&rsquo;s election. All three are Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to check whether Harris stretched the truth in her claim about the rapid rise in America&rsquo;s prison population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We relied on data from the Sentencing Project. The criminal justice advocacy group is considered a credible source for incarceration figures. Its data was cited by the national PolitiFact team in a recent fact check on <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/10/cory-booker/how-war-drugs-affected-incarceration-rates/\">a similar claim</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sentencing Project&rsquo;s data show there are 2.2 million people in the nation&rsquo;s federal and state prisons <em>and local jails</em> -- a 500 percent increase over the past 40 years. For comparison, the overall United States population has increased just 51 percent during that period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Available numbers from the U.S. Justice Department&rsquo;s Bureau of Justice Statistics agree with those from the Sentencing Project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris&rsquo; claim is slightly different in that it cites the nation&rsquo;s spike in &quot;prison population&quot; rather than a combined increase in prisons and jail figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some might read her statement as including both prison and jail inmates, but there&rsquo;s a significant difference between the two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To assess Harris&rsquo; more limited claim, we examined the rise of the prison population alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sentencing Project&rsquo;s data show the nation&rsquo;s prison population grew from 218,466 in 1974 to 1,508,636 in 2014, which is a nearly 600 percent increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike most politicians, it appears Harris understated her legitimate point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/7600060/Kamala%20prison%20check%20--%20graph%201.JPG\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More background</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris&rsquo; claim and stance on prison reform is significant given California&rsquo;s overcrowded prisons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At nearly 600,000 people, California has the second largest correctional population among states, behind only Texas&rsquo; nearly 700,000, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Those figures include prison and jail inmates and people on probation and parole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/7600072/Kamala%20prison%20--%20graph%202.jpg\" style=\"height:700px; width:592px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: U.S. Justice Department</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris&rsquo; claim centers on the rise of prison inmates over the past four decades. Over the past few years, however, America has seen a decline in prisoners. The nationwide total dropped about 100,000 from 2009 to 2014, according to the Sentencing Project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reforms in California account for much of that drop, as the state has reduced its prison population by about 50,000 following a 2009 federal court order to do so, according to a <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/main/blog_detail.asp?i=1676\">report </a>by the Public Policy Institute of California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In November, Californians will vote on Proposition 57, a measure proposed by Gov. Jerry Brown designed to ease the state&rsquo;s prison overcrowding. It would allow some offenders to be considered for parole earlier than now possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A campaign spokesman said Harris has declined to take a position on Prop 57, or any ballot measure, because as attorney general she is charged with writing an independent summary and title for each measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spokesman pointed to data from the Sentencing Project and other academic reports to back up Harris&rsquo; claim about the prison population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Senate candidate Kamala Harris recently said &quot;Over the last 40 years, this country&rsquo;s prison population has grown 500 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data show the nation&rsquo;s combined prison <em>and jail</em> population has grown 500 percent over this period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when isolating just the prison population, the data shows that group has soared by nearly 600 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter how you crunch the numbers, they show a dramatic rise in incarceration -- one that actually exceeds what Harris stated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her statement is on the right track, but needs this clarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>MOSTLY TRUE</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;more&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/da79554e-4177-4b1f-a88b-0a25ee20818e\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/da79554e-4177-4b1f-a88b-0a25ee20818e</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-15T15:07:53.299121", "ruling_date": "2016-09-16T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Mostly True: America\u2019s prison population has skyrocketed 500 percent in 40 years", "ruling_headline_slug": "mostly-true-americas-prison-population-has-skyrock", "ruling_link_text": "Rare understatement by political candidate", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Kamala Harris, <a href=\"http://www.kamalaharris.org/issues/criminal-justice-system/\">campaign website</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris\">tweet</a>, Aug. 22, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/10/cory-booker/how-war-drugs-affected-incarceration-rates/\">How the war on drugs affected incarceration rates</a>, July 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sentencing Project, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.sentencingproject.org/criminal-justice-facts/\">Criminal Justice Facts</a>,&quot; accessed September 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sentencing Project, &quot;<a href=\"http://sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Trends-in-US-Corrections.pdf\">Trends in U.S. Corrections,</a>&quot; January 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Justice Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcsus5084.pdf\">&quot;Historical Corrections Statistics in the United States, 1850- 1984</a>,&quot; December 1986</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Justice Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cpus14.pdf\">Correctional Populations in the United States, 2014,</a>&quot; December 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public Policy Institute of California, <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/main/blog_detail.asp?i=1676\">How California Reduced Its Prison Population</a>, February 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Nathan Click, campaign spokesman for Kamala Harris, Sept.13, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Attorney General", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Kamala", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "California", "id": 2010, "last_name": "Harris", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "kamala-harris", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Kamala_Harris_AP_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "California", "edition": "California", "edition_slug": "california", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 49, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The California Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/49/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2010/", "total_count": 10, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://oag.ca.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Over the last 40 years, this country&rsquo;s prison population has grown by 500 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a tweet.
