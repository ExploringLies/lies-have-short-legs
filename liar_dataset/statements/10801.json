When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, did Bill do better by isolating on presidents since Harry Truman?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer is yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A humble haberdasher, Harry S. Truman</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Detailed financial disclosures were not required for presidents through the 1970s, so we&rsquo;re left to rely on other resources to get a picture of a commander-in-chief&rsquo;s financial assets, said Paul Brace, a professor of political science at Rice University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, we do know a lot about their lives. Let&rsquo;s start with Truman since he&rsquo;s critical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Truman and his wife Bess were not homeowners when he became president. They rented a Washington apartment, and Bess&rsquo;&nbsp;mother, who owned the Independence, Mo., home associated with Harry Truman, shared a room with their daughter Margaret, said Alonzo Hamby, a Truman biographer and Ohio University emeritus professor of history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Truman&rsquo;s journey to public office followed bankruptcy-dodging and a failed haberdashery business in the 1920s. He worked his way up from county judge to a U.S. senator, vice president and president upon Franklin D. Roosevelt&rsquo;s death in 1945. Even when he was earning $10,000 as a senator in 1935 ($171,000 in 2015 dollars), he could not save the family farm his mother owned. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Truman&rsquo;s post-White House flirtation with bankruptcy that inspired Congress to pass presidential pensions, said Aaron Crawford, a post-doctoral student at Southern Methodist University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts can&rsquo;t pinpoint his net worth to a specific dollar figure, but all the evidence points to the number being quite low. Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, <a href=\"http://www.taxhistory.org/thp/readings.nsf/ArtWeb/1C91AC0FA1A9E39E85257D1B0041C876?OpenDocument\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>explored Truman&rsquo;s financial highs and lows</u></a> using tax returns released by his presidential library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The man from Hope, and his pre-White House wallet</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clintons are certainly unique compared to other first families in modern history for a couple big reasons: They did not inherit sizable family estates, and Hillary Clinton was the family breadwinner as Bill worked as a career politician.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before running<strong> </strong>for the White House in 1992, Clinton brought in $35,000 a year as Arkansas governor, plus some speaking fees, honorariums and in-kind income, such as living in the governor&rsquo;s residence. Hillary was a senior partner in the <a href=\"http://www.roselawfirm.com/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Rose Law Firm</u></a> of Little Rock at the time, earned $92,000 salary and listed her share of her law firm&rsquo;s profit-sharing and retirement plan between $100,001 and $250,000, according to a <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/05/us/1992-campaign-personal-finances-wealthy-investment-family-big-help-clinton.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>examination</u></a> of the couple&rsquo;s finances in 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clintons listed their net worth as nearly $700,000 in a 1992 statement, a substantial hike from the $418,692 net worth reported at the end of the 1989, according to the <em>Washington Post. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lest you worry about the financial wealth of the Clintons, the family was still well off by most any standard. The median household net worth for Americans in 2013 was <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2014/pdf/scf14.pdf\">$81,200</a>&nbsp;(see page 12), according to the Federal Reserve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other presidents since Truman</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The experts we contacted didn&rsquo;t rattle off hard numbers as they dissected various presidents&rsquo; pre-office net worth. Instead, they ruled out the obviously wealthy presidents based on their jobs and family situations. (Truman biographer Hamby used the phrases, &quot;JFK of course was quite rich,&quot; &quot;Reagan was at least quite affluent,&quot; and &quot;George H.W. Bush was at least wealthy if not filthy rich.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eliminating the obvious, experts focused on who might present Clinton with a realistic challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richard Nixon? He had a pretty lucrative law practice in New York. Lyndon B. Johnson? Journalists and historians disagree on exactly how he built his wealth, experts said, but he at least married a wealthy woman whose father owned Texas radio stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dwight D. Eisenhower? Nah, they said, as he was doing well for himself after World War II, landing on corporate boards and enjoying a good military pension and sales of his memoir, <em>Crusade in Europe</em>. &quot;You save the world, you get good royalties,&quot; said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most encouraged us to give presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carter had earned a good living as the owner of a peanut warehouse business in Georgia before running for the state Senate in 1962, said Scott Kaufman, a scholar of Ford and Carter at Francis Marion University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1979&rsquo;s <em>Jimmy Carter: A Character Portrait,</em> authors Bruce Mazlish and Edwin Diamond wrote that Carter&rsquo;s fortune was $814,000 when he became president, Kaufman said. That bests Clinton, without even having to break out the inflation calculator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A separate source &mdash; a 1976<em> Washington Post</em> <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2012/images/07/16/carter.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>article</u></a> sent over by the Hillary Clinton campaign &mdash; showed Carter had a net worth (when valuing assets at their original cost) of $512,000, which translates to<strong> </strong>$1.3 million in 1992 dollars, according to 1975 tax returns he released during his campaign against Ford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A document from the Gerald R. Ford presidential library suggests Ford had a more modest net worth compared to other presidents. <a href=\"http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/document/factbook/taxes.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The document</u></a>, dated Oct. 29, 1973, (the year before Ford became president), showed a net worth of $256,378, which had the same buying power as about $810,000 in 1992. That&rsquo;s more than the Clintons, though not by much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ford&rsquo;s finances and dealings were part of the most intense background checks for anyone ever screened for the vice presidency, Kaufman said, coming off the resignation of Nixon&nbsp;vice president Spiro Agnew earlier that month and amid looming worries about legal implications for Nixon in the Watergate scandal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They didn&rsquo;t want to appoint someone who might also have problems,&quot; Kaufman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill Clinton urged Americans to remember the Clintons&rsquo; more modest beginnings with his family&rsquo;s fattened finances in the limelight, saying, &quot;When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can decide whether his point is relevant, but Clinton has improved the accuracy of his factoid since making a similar claim last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could not find evidence of a president after Truman whose inflation-adjusted net worth was smaller than the Clintons&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-05-05T11:58:13.913550", "ruling_date": "2015-05-07T09:46:25", "ruling_headline": "Bill Clinton: We had the lowest net worth of any president entering office since Harry Truman", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-clinton-we-had-lowest-net-worth-any-president", "ruling_link_text": "Bubba must be listening", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview with Paul Brace, Rice University political science professor, May 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Alonzo Hamby, Ohio University distinguished professor emeritus of history, May 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University, May 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with <a href=\"http://www.fmarion.edu/academics/facultyandstaff/article38448c7536671.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Scott Kaufman</u></a>, Francis Marion University political science professor, May 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Josh Schwerin, Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman, May 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PunditFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/29/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-i-had-lowest-net-worth-any-american-p/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bill Clinton: &#39;I had the lowest net worth of any American president in the 20th century</u></a>&#39;,&quot;
