All the victims -- including seven men, one woman and a 15-year-old girl -- have been released from the hospital, <a href=\"http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2016-09-19-US--Minnesota%20Mall%20Stabbings/id-57c6a17054f5485088914ced3b1d8156\">the Associated Press</a> reported. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only person who was killed was the suspected attacker, a young Somali man dressed as a private security guard, who was shot by an off-duty police officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Sept. 19 fundraising email promoting Team America PAC&#39;s gun giveaway&nbsp;quoted Tancredo, the group&#39;s founder and president, saying: &quot;I mentioned that we live in dangerous times -- and the events of this week only remind us of that fact once more.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The threat of radical Islam is higher than ever as the nation mourns the death of eight Americans at the hands of a Somalian refugee in Minnesota,&quot; the email inaccurately stated. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;With these continued threats it&#39;s important that we do everything in our power to defend ourselves and our families,&quot; Tancredo said. &quot;&hellip;.I can think of no better way to defend yourself and your family than with an H&amp;K P2000, the same gun used by Border Patrol agents.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The email linked to a <a href=\"https://support.teamamericapac.com/secure-borders-gun-giveaway/\">Team America PAC website</a> where people could enter the &quot;Gun Giveaway&quot; sweepstakes for the .40-caliber Heckler &amp; Koch handgun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Tancredo statement on the contest page said it&#39;s being held to &quot;To encourage Americans to elect candidates for office who will work to secure our border.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;After you sign up for the giveaway, please consider making a donation of $100, $50, $25 or even $10,&quot; Tacredo said. &quot;We can only continue the fight to secure our borders with your help!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When PolitiFact partner Denver7 notified Tancredo of the factual error in its fundraising email, he said he was aware of the error and issued this correction to PolitiFact and Denver7:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My email earlier this morning inaccurately portrayed that the attacks in Minnesota led to innocent deaths and not simply the death of the perpetrator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Despite that error, the email was correct in stating that these truly are troubling times, a fact furthered by the shootout and arrest of the Afghani bombing suspect in New Jersey just moments ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Please read the email below for more information regarding how you can protect yourself and your family in the face of these attacks by entering Team America PAC&#39;s gun giveaway. I apologize for any confusion with the last email.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interview, Tancredo told PolitiFact the PAC&#39;s two-man staff had made &quot;apologies all the way around&quot; for the error. &quot;It&#39;s my fault too because I should have proofed it,&quot; he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tancredo&#39;s PAC said that &quot;the threat of radical Islam is higher than ever as the nation mourns the death of eight Americans at the hands of a Somalian refugee in Minnesota.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He acknowledged the statement was incorrect and issued a correction.
