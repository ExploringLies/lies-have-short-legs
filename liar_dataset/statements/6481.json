Rush Holt, Frank Pallone and Bill Pascrell, all of whom voted for the reform in March 2010. They&rsquo;re also up for reelection this November against GOP challengers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact National recently issued a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/15/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-barack-obama-first-history-rob-me/\">Mostly False</a> to presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney for claiming President Barack Obama &quot;robbed&quot; Medicare of $716 billion to pay for the reform.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy attacking the congressmen, the committee makes the same mistake as Romney, but then goes one step further in rehashing that myth about the reform being a government takeover.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, we&rsquo;ll talk about the reduction in Medicare spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOver the last couple of years, Republicans have frequently criticized the reform for cutting $500 billion from Medicare. U.S. Reps. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/29/jon-runyan/jon-runyan-claims-barack-obamas-health-care-includ/\">Jon Runyan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/03/scott-garrett/scott-garrett-claims-affordable-care-act-raidts-me/\">Scott Garrett</a> have each received Mostly False rulings for repeating that claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the reform does not cut $500 billion from the current Medicare budget. Instead, the reform aims to slow the program&rsquo;s future spending growth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, that $500 billion has represented the reduction in spending increases during the 2012-2021 period, according to a 2011 estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn its latest estimate released last month, the budget office said the reform would reduce future Medicare spending by $716 billion between 2013 and 2022. The $741 billion figure cited by the committee includes that Medicare spending and money for other federal programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMost of those Medicare savings come from reducing annual increases in payments to certain health care providers. The reduction in Medicare spending helps offset other costs created by the reform.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the committee is wrong to claim Democrats support &quot;gutting&quot; Medicare. Program spending will still increase under the reform, but just at a slower pace.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, we&rsquo;ll address whether the reform represents a &quot;big-government healthcare takeover.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat claim has been debunked numerous times and was ultimately named <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2010/dec/16/lie-year-government-takeover-health-care/\">PolitiFact&rsquo;s 2010 Lie of the Year</a>.

Chris Christie for repeating the line in October 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe reform does impose more government regulations on individuals, employers and private insurance companies. For instance, people must purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty, with some exemptions. Also, insurers can sell coverage through new insurance exchanges as long as they meet certain federal standards.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the reform does not create a new public health insurance plan, and it doesn&rsquo;t eliminate the private health insurance industry. In fact, more people will become enrolled in private insurance plans under the reform, according to budget office projections.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn response to our findings, the committee didn&rsquo;t back down from its original claims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Democrats stole from seniors&rsquo; Medicare benefits to pay for their government takeover of healthcare,&quot; NRCC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek said in an e-mail. &quot;Their addiction to government spending sprees has crossed the line by threatening seniors&rsquo; access to healthcare, and New Jersey families will stop this reckless behavior this November.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn news releases, the committee claimed Holt, Pallone and Pascrell are &quot;willing to jeopardize seniors&rsquo; access to coverage by gutting $741 billion from Medicare&quot; to pay for a &quot;big-government healthcare takeover.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe health care reform is projected to reduce future Medicare spending by more than $700 billion between 2013 and 2022, but program spending will still increase. That increase will just be smaller than without the reform.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe &quot;healthcare takeover&quot; claim remains bogus, because the private health insurance industry remains intact under the reform and stands to gain more enrollees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s only one ruling for such heated and misleading claims: Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/08/politifact_nj_republicans_clai.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-16T15:28:48.177976", "ruling_date": "2012-08-19T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "House Democrats support \u201cgutting\u201d Medicare by more than $700 billion to pay for a \u201cbig-government healthcare takeover,\u201d Republicans claim", "ruling_headline_slug": "house-democrats-support-gutting-medicare-more-700-", "ruling_link_text": "An old line of attack", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNational Republican Congressional Committee, <a href=\"http://nrcc.org/default.asp?id=274&amp;newsid=4112\">#IWANTREPEAL: If Dems Have Their Way, Medicare Will Be Broke in 12 Years</a>, Aug. 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/15/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-barack-obama-first-history-rob-me/\">Mitt Romney said Barack Obama robs Medicare of more than $700 billion to pay for Obamacare</a>, Aug. 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, <a href=\"http://cbo.gov/publication/43471\">Letter to the Honorable John Boehner providing an estimate for H.R. 6079, the Repeal of Obamacare Act</a>, July 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/03/scott-garrett/scott-garrett-claims-affordable-care-act-raidts-me/\">Scott Garrett claims Affordable Care Act cuts Medicare funding, creates &quot;rationing board&quot;</a>, Aug. 3, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/29/jon-runyan/jon-runyan-claims-barack-obamas-health-care-includ/\">Jon Runyan claims Affordable Care Act cuts Medicare program by $500 billion</a>, June 29, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office,<a href=\"http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12119/03-30-healthcarelegislation.pdf\"> CBO&rsquo;s Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010</a>, March 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office,<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/06-05-Long-Term_Budget_Outlook.pdf\"> The 2012 Long-Term Budget Outlook</a>, June 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, <a href=\"http://cbo.gov/publication/43060\">Medicare -- March 2012 Baseline</a>, March 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Kaiser Family Foundation,<a href=\"http://kaiseredu.org/tutorials/Medicare-and-health-reform/player.html\"> Health Reform and Medicare: Overview of Key Provisions</a>, July 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office,<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/113xx/doc11379/amendreconprop.pdf\"> Letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>, March 20, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMinnesota Public Radio, <a href=\"http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/polinaut/archive/2012/08/poligraph_gop_c_3.shtml\">PoliGraph: GOP claim on Obama Medicare cuts misleads</a>, Aug. 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/23/chris-christie/chris-christie-slams-health-care-reform-government/\">Chris Christie slams health care reform as &quot;a government takeover of health care&quot;</a>, Oct. 23, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaiser Health News, <a href=\"http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2012/August/11/faq-paul-ryan-house-republican-medicare-plan.aspx\">FAQ: How Paul Ryan Proposes To Change Medicare</a>, Aug. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone and e-mail interview with Andrea Bozek, spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, Aug. 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCenters for Medicare &amp;
