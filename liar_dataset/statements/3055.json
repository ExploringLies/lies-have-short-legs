Once the president accepted an invitation, he said, the White House helped coordinate some logistics, such as security, but that was the extent of the White House involvement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd &quot;Together We Thrive&quot; was conceived by a University of Arizona student, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs said during his briefing that the university was responsible for logistics. &quot;I think it&rsquo;s important to understand we were invited to and accepted quite happily the invitation of the university,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that Malkin later added an update to her blog posting that stated, &quot;As noted above, the University of Arizona announced the Together We Thrive event &mdash; and a few readers wrote in to say that the campus initiated the logo/campaign. Given U of A president Robert Shelton&#39;s embarrassing, thinly-veiled partisan cheerleading for Obama tonight, it may indeed be a 100 percent-campus-initiated campaign. Given the Obama White House&#39;s meticulous attention to stage prop details, however, I would say the odds of involvement by Axelrod/Plouffe &amp; Co. are high.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut university spokesman Cruz said all of the &quot;stage prop details,&quot; as Malkin called them, were entirely conceived by and arranged by the college.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe burden of proof is on Malkin and she has failed to prove any White House involvement. She may believe she sees the handiwork of the White House at play, but there&#39;s no evidence to back that up. Certainly not enough to justify her claim the White House used the shooting tragedy as an opportunity to orchestrate a &quot;branded&quot; political event.
