But that report also noted that jobs are up in 2011.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tSo is it possible, as Falk claims, that Wisconsin is losing jobs at rates not seen since at least the 1990s?<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Falk&rsquo;s evidence</strong><br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tWhen we asked Falk spokeswoman Melissa Mulliken for evidence, she cited two <em>Journal Sentinel</em> news articles.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tShe highlighted the first sentence of an <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/state-loses-9300-privatesector-jobs-in-october-1s33j36-134051023.html\">article</a> about job losses in September 2011:<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t&quot;Wisconsin shed private-sector jobs for the third consecutive month in September, while employment at government agencies and public schools registered its deepest drop in decades.&quot;<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tThe article went on to say that the loss of an estimated 11,500 jobs among city, county, state and public school employees was the &quot;deepest single-month decline since at least 1990.&quot;<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t(The figure has since been revised to 10,200, according to the state Department of Workforce Development, which produces the state&rsquo;s monthly employment reports. That is still the largest monthly loss of public-sector jobs since at least 1990.)<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tBut Falk claimed &quot;we are losing jobs at rates not seen in decades,&quot; without any qualification or explanation. We think to the average reader that means jobs overall -- not merely public-sector jobs-- especially since it was in the context of Walker&rsquo;s 250,000-jobs pledge.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tMulliken also cited an <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/state-loses-9300-privatesector-jobs-in-october-1s33j36-134051023.html\">article</a> about October 2011 job losses, which are the most recent figures available.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tThe article said October marked the state&rsquo;s fourth consecutive month of job declines -- but it said nothing about the losses being the worst in decades.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Other evidence</strong><br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tLet&rsquo;s review Walker&rsquo;s record on jobs during his first 10 months in office.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tAs we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/promise/526/create-250000-new-jobs/\">reported</a> on the Walk-O-Meter, the state has added a net 20,100 private-sector jobs in 2011 through October. (The November numbers are due out Dec. 15). But as noted, public-sector jobs have dropped under Walker, so let&rsquo;s get the full picture.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tOverall figures show the state gained jobs during each of the first six months of 2011 and lost jobs during each of the next four months.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tThe net result? A total of 11,200 jobs have been added under Walker.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tThat would seem to shoot down Falk&rsquo;s claim. But let&rsquo;s look even more closely.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tIf you highlight the four months in 2011 where there were losses -- July through October -- the state lost 27,600 jobs, including more than 10,000 in September alone. Are either of those figures the highest in decades?<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tNo.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tUnder Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle in 2009 -- when the state suffered a net loss of 121,000 jobs -- 84,700 jobs were lost during the first four months of the year, including 24,700 in April alone.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tFalk said that despite Walker&rsquo;s claim to being focused on job creation, since he took office in January 2011, &quot;we are losing jobs at rates not seen in decades&quot; -- suggesting that job losses overall are the highest in decades. But the evidence she provided cites only public-sector jobs.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tOverall, the state has seen a net gain in jobs since Walker took office.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tAnd in the months when jobs have declined under Walker, we have to go back only two years to find job losses at a greater rate.<br />\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\tWe rate Falk&rsquo;s statement False.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-12-13T14:23:33.348725", "ruling_date": "2011-12-14T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Potential recall candidate Kathleen Falk says job losses under Wisconsin Gov.
