Too many extra pounds add to our risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, sleep disturbances and a host of other problems. Research shows that, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/downloads/obesity_trends_2009.pdf\">as a nation, we are getting fatter</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s more than a problem just for people who are overweight. When obesity levels rise and the population becomes less healthy, it drives up health costs, which affect all of us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut is it really true that more than 1 in 5 Rhode Islanders and nearly one-third of our teens and preteens aren&#39;t just overweight, they&#39;re obese?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat was the contention of Rep. Joseph McNamara, a Warwick Democrat, when he introduced bills requiring restaurants to provide more nutrition information in hopes of combating the problem.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;About 22 percent of adults in Rhode Island and approximately 30 percent of youth (ages 10-17) are considered obese,&quot; he is quoted as saying <a href=\"http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/News/pr1.asp?prid=7102\">in a legislative news release</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObesity is determined by your body-mass index, a number that&#39;s cumbersome to calculate, in part because it&#39;s often defined in metric units, which is one reason why many people don&#39;t know what their BMI is.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(To calculate your BMI, take your weight in pounds and multiply it by 703. Next, convert your height to inches and multiply that number by itself. So if you&rsquo;re 65 inches tall, multiply 65 by 65 to get 4,225. &nbsp;Then, you take the weight number and divide it by the height number, you get your BMI. Alternatively, you can go online at www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/ and have the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute <a href=\"http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/\">do the calculation for you</a>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf your body-mass index is 25 or higher, you&#39;re overweight. If the number is 30 or higher, you&#39;re obese. In easier-to-understand terms, a 5-feet-2-inches tall, 164-pound person is obese. So is a 6-footer who weighs 221 pounds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we called McNamara&#39;s office to find out if that many Rhode Islanders really score 30 or more, we were directed to <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/stateprograms/fundedstates/rhode_island.html\">an online report</a> from Eliza Lawson of the Health Department&#39;s Initiative for a Healthy Weight. Lawson, in turn, said McNamara&#39;s numbers are supported by reports based on the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://healthyamericans.org/reports/obesity2009/Obesity2009Report.pdf\">state-by-state rankings</a> compiled in 2009 by the Trust for America&#39;s Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation show that Rhode Island has an adult obesity rate of 21.7 percent, which would round up to the 22 percent cited by McNamara.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe 2009 report also offers statistics for children age 10-17. That&#39;s where we found a Rhode Island number of 30.1 percent, matching McNamara&rsquo;s number.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut there&#39;s one big problem.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat 30.1 percent figure isn&rsquo;t for obese children. It includes all overweight children.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo get the correct number for obese children, we went to <a href=\"http://healthyamericans.org/reports/obesity2010/Obesity2010Report.pdf\">the 2010 version</a> of the report, which shows that the obesity rate for Rhode Island&#39;s youth, based on a 2007 survey, is much lower than McNamara states -- 14.4 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo how does Rhode Island rank?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs adults, we have one of the lowest obesity rates in the United States. In the 2009 report, we were 48th among the 50 states and the District of Columbia; only Connecticut, Massachusetts and Colorado had lower obesity rates. In 2010, our obesity rate rose by 1.2 percentage points and we moved to 45th.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRhode Island&#39;s teens and preteens ranked 28th, essentially at the national average.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(The adult percentages have a margin of error of plus or minus 0.9 percentage points. The childhood percentages, because the numbers are small, have a larger margin of error: plus or minus 3.2 points.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we told McNamara that the data showed a much lower rate among children than he had cited, he produced a copy of an &quot;Eat Smart, Move More&quot; newsletter that gives the 30-percent figure. But that newsletter incorrectly quotes a 2010 Rhode Island Department of Health report, which had the correct figures on overweight and obesity.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn summary, McNamara&#39;s assessment of adult obesity in Rhode Island is correct, if a bit outdated, and he fails to note that Rhode Island ranks as healthier than a large majority of other states. But his statistic on childhood obesity is<em> way</em> off - roughly half of what he said it was.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThus, we rate his statement as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">Half True</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-03-24T18:31:38.507928", "ruling_date": "2011-03-25T00:01:00", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
