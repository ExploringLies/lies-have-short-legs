That law, which Nelson voted for, was adopted in February 2009 by <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.wi.us/spotlight/spotl366.htm\">three-vote </a><a href=\"http://www.legis.state.wi.us/spotlight/spotl366.htm\">margins</a> in both the Assembly and the Senate. It was a budget-adjustment measure that also directed an initial $300 million in federal stimulus funds to the state Department of Transportation. The money was for 47 projects, mostly on highways and freeways.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, for Nelson&rsquo;s &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of jobs statement to be correct, that $300 million would have to have created at least 20,000 jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid it?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom the beginning, stimulus job-count figures have been beset with problems, in Wisconsin and around the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, for example, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/69254347.html\">found</a> that an October 2009 report by the White House -- claiming stimulus money created or saved more than 10,000 jobs in Wisconsin -- was rife with errors, double counting and inflated numbers. In January 2010, the White House abandoned its method of counting jobs &quot;created or saved.&quot; Instead, it began labeling jobs as having been funded by stimulus dollars.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat isn&rsquo;t to say the stimulus has not had any effect. A July 2010 <a href=\"http://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/End-of-Great-Recession.pdf\">paper</a> by two economists -- <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/%7Eblinder/\">one</a> from the public sector and <a href=\"http://www.dismal.com/dismal/bios.asp?author=25\">one</a> rom the private -- said stimulus spending created 2.7 million jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Nelson&rsquo;s claim was not about all stimulus money, just that initial gush of cash given to the DOT.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNelson said he based his jobs statement on &quot;talking points,&quot; which he later said were based on two sources:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe <a href=\"http://www.recovery.wisconsin.gov/JobsOverview.aspx\">state website</a> that tracks federal stimulus spending, which says 63,000 jobs have been created or saved.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tA November 2009 <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.wi.us/assembly/asm78/news/pdf/Press%20Releases/2009/Nov.Private%20jobs%20report.pdf\">news release</a> from state Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison), which cites two statements about new jobs. One <a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/1006/091119_OE_139.pdf\">statement</a>, from a contractors group and three unions, referred to a study that said the 2009 state budget would create more than 25,000 jobs. &nbsp;The other <a href=\"http://www.iuoe139.org/uploads/news/TRANS_112409.pdf\">statement</a>, from a transportation builders group, predicted the state budget and &quot;remaining federal stimulus dollars will support&quot; more than 28,500 jobs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut Nelson is mixing apples and oranges.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first talking point refers to jobs created or saved, when Nelson&rsquo;s comment referred only to jobs created. What&rsquo;s more, the 63,000 figure is based on all stimulus money given to the state as of August 2010, not the initial $300 million Nelson originally cited.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second talking point moves everything to a different source. It claims the state budget -- not stimulus money -- would create the jobs cited. Or the budget and remaining stimulus money. Again, Nelson is off point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are hard numbers -- rather than predictions -- that Nelson could have used to gauge the effect of the $300 million given to DOT.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Wisconsin analyzed figures from <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/Pages/home.aspx\">Recovery.gov</a>, the federal website that tracks stimulus funds. The latest data available show that, through the first half of 2010, the $300 million cited by Nelson funded 1,203 jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s no way to know how many were created and how many were saved. But that&rsquo;s miles away from Nelson&rsquo;s original claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOK, almost time for the second half kickoff.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhere does all of this leave us?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNelson stated that an initial $300 million in stimulus money for road projects created tens of thousands of jobs in Wisconsin. As evidence, he turns to much broader measures -- jobs created or saved, all stimulus spending, the state budget and stimulus money. But the actual jobs figure from the initial allotment barely exceeds 1,200 -- and even that is a mix of jobs created and jobs saved.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Nelson&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-24T13:41:12.811128", "ruling_date": "2010-09-26T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tom Nelson says initial stimulus allocation created tens of thousands of new jobs in Wisconsin", "ruling_headline_slug": "tom-nelson-says-initial-stimulus-allocation-create", "ruling_link_text": "In this stimulus math mashup 1,200 = 20,000-plus", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWisconsin Public Radio, <a href=\"http://wpr.org/news/newsstories.cfm\">Hopefuls for Lieutenant Governor share job growth plans</a>, Sept. 7, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/End-of-Great-Recession.pdf\">How the Great Recession Was Brought to an End</a>, report by economists Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi, July 27, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2010/feb/17/stimulus-report-card/\">A stimulus report card</a>, PolitiFact.com, Feb. 17, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCouncil of Economic Advisers, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/100113-economic-impact-arra-second-quarterly-report.pdf\">The Economic Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</a> (page 26 of report, page 31 of pdf), Jan. 13, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Government Accountability Office, <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/Accountability/Documents/d10223.pdf\">Recovery Act -- Recipient Reported Jobs Data Provide Some Insight into Use of Recovery Act Funding, but Data Quality and Reporting Issues Need Attention</a>, November 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRecovery.gov, <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/News/featured/Pages/Calculator.aspx\">How Jobs Are Calculated</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Governors Association, <a href=\"http://www.nga.org/portal/site/nga/menuitem.8fd3d12ab65b304f8a278110501010a0?submit=Submit&amp;State=WI\">Wisconsin governors list</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin State Assembly, <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.wi.us/asmhome.htm\">2009-2010 Assembly Officers</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with lieutenant governor candidate Thomas Nelson, Sept. 20, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState of Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2009/data/acts/09Act2.pdf\">Wisconsin 2009 Act 2</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/83512527.html\">Seeing double with job numbers</a>, Feb. 4, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/69254347.html\">Don&rsquo;t count on stimulus job tally</a>, Nov. 4, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/81286837.html\">Stimulus jobs tally changes</a>, Jan. 13, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/39793452.html\">Legislature passes budget-repair measure</a>, Feb. 19, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Office of Recovery and Reinvestment, <a href=\"http://www.recovery.wisconsin.gov/JobsOverview.aspx\">Recovery Act Job Creation </a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState.
