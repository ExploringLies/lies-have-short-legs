(Zito paraphrased part of Bush&rsquo;s quote in her <a href=\"http://triblive.com/politics/politicalheadlines/8147758-74/bush-terrorism-florida#axzz3XO3B7Cm9\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>article</u></a>, but she provided us with the full text of Bush&rsquo;s comment.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We knew that the national employment picture has improved, slowly but surely, since the official end of the recession in mid&nbsp;2009. But has the typical household income in the United States really <em>fallen </em>since the end of the recession? If true, that would be pretty startling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it turns out, median income <em>has </em>fallen, once you take inflation into account. Here are the details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2014, the U.S. Census Bureau published its <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/demo/p60-249.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>annual roundup of data on income and poverty</u></a>. Table A-2 in the report provides data on the inflation-adjusted, median household income for the most recent 10 years:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\">\r\n<table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border:none; width:624px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Year</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Inflation-adjusted, median household income</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2009</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$54,059</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2010</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$52,646</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2011</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$51,842</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2012</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$51,759</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2013</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$51,939</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This shows that, despite a slight uptick between 2012 and 2013, real median household income has fallen since the start of the recovery in 2009 by $2,120. That&rsquo;s about 4 percent, or roughly 1 percent per year, every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only caveat we should mention is that the most recent data stops at the end of 2013, and we don&rsquo;t know yet whether income gains accelerated enough in 2014 to make up for the losses between 2009 and 2013. Still, we won&rsquo;t mark down Bush for this, since he was using the most current data available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s sad but true that real median income is below what it was in 2009 and 2010,&quot; said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. &quot;Real median income kept dropping well after the official end of the recession and has been pretty close to flat since 2011.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She added that the losses have not been experienced equally. Incomes, Sinclair noted, &quot;have fallen in the lower parts of the income distribution,&quot; whereas the the top 10 percent of the income spectrum, and even more elite segments, have experienced gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Bush was clearly speaking about the overall national picture, so we find no fault with his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush said that &quot;we are in the sixth year of recovery, and median income is below what it was at the start of the recovery.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s right, once you take inflation into account and if you use the most recent data available, which goes through 2013.
