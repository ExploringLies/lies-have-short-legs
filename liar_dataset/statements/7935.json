Ron Hood, R-Ashville, the sponsor of the legislation, <a href=\"http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/bills.cfm?ID=130_HB_200\">House Bill 200</a>, said he drafted it based on talks with the National Pro-Life Alliance. He said it was intended to make women more aware of what they are doing to &quot;<a href=\"http://www.mansfieldnewsjournal.com/article/20130613/NEWS01/306130026/Ohio-abortion-bill-could-add-requirements-women\">make an informed choice</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among its provisions, the bill would require abortion providers to tell patients about &quot;the increased risk of breast cancer&quot; from abortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know more about that warning. We called to ask Hood for the source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His legislative aide referred us to the website of the <a href=\"http://www.abortionbreastcancer.com/index/\">Coalition on Abortion/Breast Cancer</a>, an advocacy group that asserts there has been a &quot;cover-up&quot; of a link between abortion and breast cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A review of the website shows that the group&#39;s case for a link is supported largely by the work of Dr. Joel Brind, a member of the group&#39;s advisory board, who is a professor of biochemistry at Baruch College in New York City and is recognized as the leading proponent of an abortion-breast cancer link; and Dr. Angela Lanfranchi, a breast cancer surgeon in New Jersey who, with Brind, co-founded the <a href=\"http://www.bcpinstitute.org\">Breast Cancer Prevention Institute</a> to help publicize what is sometimes called the ABC (for abortion-breast cancer) link.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1251638/\">review of the history</a> shows their work is a significant part of what has been called &quot;abortion politics.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research on a possible connection had been going on for decades when Brind published an analysis in the 1990s that suggested a link between induced abortion (the deliberate ending of a pregnancy) and an increased risk of breast cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the analysis was based on studies that relied on survey interviews of women, which were widely questioned because of factors including &quot;response bias&quot; -- &nbsp;the inaccurate self-reporting of medical history information by participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequent studies using larger groups and data not subject to bias found no link, according to sources including the <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/abortion-miscarriage\">National Cancer Institute</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2003, largely because of <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080327055020/http://oversight.house.gov/features/politics_and_science/example_breast_cancer.htm\">political questions raised</a> over the &quot;ABC link,&quot; the <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/reproductive-history\">NCI convened</a> a three-day conference of experts on abortion and cancer. Based on a review of population-based, clinical and animal studies, they concluded that having an abortion or miscarriage does not increase a woman&rsquo;s subsequent risk of developing breast cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hood also pointed specifically to a <a href=\"http://www.bcpinstitute.org/2009-Lanfranchi-LinacreQuarterly%5B1%5D.pdf\">2009 paper by Lanfranchi</a> about the mechanisms of cancer. It asserted that a prematurely ended pregnancy leaves a woman with more cancer-susceptible breast tissue than when the pregnancy began.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also in 2009, however, the Committee on Gynecologic Practice of the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19461458\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a> concluded that &quot;more rigorous recent studies demonstrate no causal relationship between induced abortion and a subsequent increase in breast cancer risk.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact does not do medical or scientific analysis. We rely, as we do in other areas, on the most reliable and independent sources available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://apps.who.int/inf-fs/en/fact240.html\">World Health Organization</a> says that abortion does not increase the risk of breast cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Britain&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/NEBAbortionSummary.pdf\">Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists</a> says that abortion does not increase the risk of breast cancer. The <a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/cancer/breastcancer/moreinformation/is-abortion-linked-to-breast-cancer\">American Cancer Society</a> says: &quot;scientific research studies have not found a cause-and-effect relationship between abortion and breast cancer.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/Table25Abortionandbreastcancerrisk.html\">Susan. G. Komen Foundation</a> says there is no link.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/reproductive-history\">National Cancer Institute</a> gives its highest strength-of-evidence ratings to the statements that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Recognized spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Women who have had an induced abortion have the same risk of breast cancer as other women.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Women who have had a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) have the same risk of breast cancer as other women.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Cancers other than breast cancer also appear to be unrelated to a history of induced or spontaneous abortion.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The credible research overwhelmingly contradicts the statement in Hood&rsquo;s legislation. It&rsquo;s a ridiculous claim, and even more ridiculous to force doctors to spread this misinformation to patients.
