The president can't repeal a law on his own,\" said Don Ritchie, associate historian of the Senate Historical Office.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"Congress has the power of the purse and passes legislation. It's the president who's dependent on Congress to get legislation passed,\" he said.\n</p>\n<p>\n If we broaden our view from the 30-second ad, Edwards fleshed out his idea in a September 2007 speech he gave in Chicago. During that speech, he explained that his plan was to \"submit legislation that ends health care coverage for the president, all members of Congress, and all senior political appointees in both branches of government on July 20th, 2009 -- unless we have passed universal health care reform.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n That's a more realistic scenario, and there's nothing to stop a president from submitting legislation if he can find a member to introduce it. But count us dubious on Congress voting away its own health care coverage.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the meantime, we find Edwards' lordly pronouncement in his TV ad to border on the absurd. As a former member of the U.S. senate, he should know better. For that reason, we give him the rare Pants on Fire ruling.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:32.804665", "ruling_date": "2007-11-07T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Prez can't snatch Congress' health care", "ruling_headline_slug": "prez-cant-snatch-congress-health-care", "ruling_link_text": "Prez can't snatch Congress' health care", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "John Edwards campaign,\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm6zze1pWyM\">\n Health Care ad,\n</a>\nNov. 12, 2007.\n<p>\n John Edwards campaign,\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "former senator", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "North Carolina", "id": 9, "last_name": "Edwards", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "john-edwards", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-johnedwards.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/9/", "total_count": 15, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://www.johnedwards.com/"}, "statement": "Edwards says if Congress won't pass universal health care, he'll tell Congress: \"I'm going to use my power as president to take your health care away from you.\"", "statement_context": "a TV ad", "statement_date": "2007-11-12", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
