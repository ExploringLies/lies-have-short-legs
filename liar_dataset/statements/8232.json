Scott Walker has so cocooned himself from regular folks, state Senate Minority Leader <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/chris-larson/\"><u>Chris Larson</u></a> contends, that he &quot;hasn&#39;t done a public event in this entire year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait, what?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Larson made the <a href=\"https://ia801003.us.archive.org/24/items/CHRISLARSONSLY082713/CHRIS%20LARSON%20-%20SLY%20082713.mp3\"><u>statement</u></a> Aug. 27, 2013, on Madison-area radio station WEKZ-FM (93.7), then quickly told liberal talk show host John Sylvester what he meant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Just to be clear, Sly. His events, they&#39;re open to press, donors and for invited guests. I wouldn&#39;t consider that a public event,&quot; Larson said. &quot;A public event, I would consider something where folks, the working class, can actually make it, where it&#39;s not working hours and it&#39;s something where it&#39;s not invite-only.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the Milwaukee Democrat has his own idea of what constitutes a public event, although we&rsquo;re not bound by that definition in rating his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Narrow definition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Larson to back his statement, he elaborated by saying that, besides being open without invitation and held outside of regular working hours, a public event should allow ordinary citizens to express opinions to or ask questions of the governor, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s not evidence of what Larson said in the interview and it&rsquo;s an even more narrow definition of public event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By that definition, most meetings of legislative committees -- typically scheduled during business hours -- are not &quot;public events.&quot; And it suggests that when the governor visits a factory or business and talks to workers, it shouldn&rsquo;t count simply because someone off the street couldn&rsquo;t walk in and participate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Larson doesn&rsquo;t exactly back off his claim. He just aims to shift it to more favorable terms for himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Larson also pointed to a series of public hearings he held on evenings and weekends on the 2013-&rsquo;15 state budget, saying Walker has appeared at no such events this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s no question that access to the governor -- really, any governor -- is limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker typically gives a day&rsquo;s notice to news media of what some of his appearances will be the following day. Indeed, he doesn&#39;t release detailed daily itineraries until weeks <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/08/kathleen-falk/wisconsin-dem-candidate-governor-says-scott-walker/\"><u>after the fact</u>, a <u>practice</u></a> followed by Walker&rsquo;s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, for most of his time as governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, just a few weeks before Larson made his claim, there was Walker <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/wisconsin-state-fair-brings-rivals-tom-barrett-scott-walker-together-b9966942z1-217998171.html\"><u>addressing</u></a> folks along with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, to open the Wisconsin State Fair, and <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/blog/2013/08/business-leaders-celebrate-wisconsin.html\"><u>attending</u></a> the Governor&rsquo;s Red, White and Blue Ribbon Livestock Auction. The fair, obviously, is about an accessible public an event as there is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, let&#39;s take a closer look at where Walker has been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Events in 2013</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker spokesman Tom Evenson sent us a list of more than 100 Walker events in 2013 that Evenson described as public. Some were easily accessible to the general public; others, because of cost, membership requirements or other reasons, weren&#39;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s a sampling:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The World Championship Snowmobile Derby in Eagle River, an event that attracted thousands. Television <a href=\"http://www.wjfw.com/stories.html?sku=20130118214410&amp;display=video\"><u>news coverage</u></a> showed Walker delivering opening remarks and shaking hands with folks wearing snowmobile suits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Martin Luther King Jr. ceremony in the Capitol rotunda in Madison. Hundreds of people attended the 33rd annual event, including a few who booed during Walker&rsquo;s remarks, <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/mlk-tribute-draws-hundreds-and-some-criticism-for-gov-walker/article_b27a54a0-6409-11e2-89be-0019bb2963f4.html\"><u>according</u></a> to the <em>Wisconsin State Journal</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The annual State Education Convention at a Milwaukee hotel. Hundreds of school district officials and school board members heard Walker speak, the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/walker-to-speak-this-morning-at-education-conference-cm8h2sa-188346781.html\"><u>reported</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three-day Governor&rsquo;s Conference on Economic Development in Madison. <a href=\"http://weda.site-ym.com/?Email_Dec7\"><u>Registration cost</u></a> a minimum of $250 for Wisconsin Economic Development Association members and up to $340 for non-members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Rifle Association state convention in Wausau, where Walker <a href=\"http://wtaq.com/news/articles/2013/feb/09/walker-wont-interfere-with-process-on-skyward-appeal/\"><u>gave a speech</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A South Suburban Chamber of Commerce awards dinner in Oak Creek.

The dinner <a href=\"http://www.southsuburbanchamber.com/default.aspx?id=14\"><u>cost $50</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Military-related ceremonies in Pewaukee, at Camp Douglas and elsewhere. <a href=\"http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/VideoNetwork/2102516462001/The-1157th-comes-home-to-Oshkosh\"><u>TV coverage</u></a> of one event, at the Experimental Aircraft Association in Oshkosh, showed Walker speaking to a large gathering of Army National Guard members and their families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Independence Day parades in <a href=\"http://menomoneefalls.patch.com/groups/summer/p/falls-celebrates-independence-day\"><u>Menomonee Falls</u></a> and <a href=\"http://wauwatosa.patch.com/groups/summer/p/wisn-wauwatosa-fourth-of-july-photo-gallery\"><u>Wauwatosa</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of government meetings in Madison, including Walker presenting his state budget proposal and giving his &quot;state of the state&quot; address. In criticizing Walker&rsquo;s availability to the general public, a progressive blogger <a href=\"http://www.bluecheddar.net/?p=32798\"><u>pointed out</u></a> that an upcoming meeting of the state Building Commission, which the governor is a member of, would be open to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An <a href=\"http://www.piercemfg.com/en/pierce/events/100th-Anniversary-Open-House.aspx\"><u>open house</u></a> held by Pierce Manufacturing near Appleton to mark the firetruck maker&rsquo;s 100th anniversary.

He also mingled with students and posed for pictures with them, according to <a href=\"http://www.nbc26.com/news/190723931.html\"><u>images</u></a> from a local TV station.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The governor&rsquo;s annual prayer breakfast. <a href=\"http://www.wisconsingovernorsprayerbreakfast.com/TicketOrderForm2013.pdf\"><u>Tickets</u></a> were priced at $30 and up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The annual Greater Milwaukee Law Enforcement Memorial Ceremony.
