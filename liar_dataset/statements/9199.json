RT correspondent Anissa Naouai took the opposite tack, saying that the American media is believing everything the government in Kiev is saying while claiming news coming out of Russia is propaganda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can watch the <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/cnns-cuomo-grills-rt-reporter-who-claims-russia-didnt-invade-ukraine/\"><u>debate here if you like</u></a>, but what struck us was a claim by Naouai about the American military.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Cuomo described the United States as &quot;war weary,&quot; Naouai responded:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;War weary?&quot; she asked. &quot;The U.S. spends more money on its military than the 16 biggest military budgets in the world. I wouldn&rsquo;t call the U.S. military weary.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the context, it is clear that Naouai was talking about the next 16 biggest military budgets in the world combined. That&rsquo;s what we decided to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found two credible groups that attempt to track military spending around the globe, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London think tank, and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are flaws in each group&rsquo;s numbers -- the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute uses budget figures (not expenditures), and some countries don&rsquo;t release detailed information on military spending -- but they are generally considered the best approximations available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, Naouai referred us to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, but we&rsquo;ll look at both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both groups recently released data for 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute put the U.S. defense budget at just over $600 billion, while the International Institute for Strategic Studies uses a figure of $640 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either number dwarfs the amount of spending by any other country, and plenty of countries combined, both groups conclude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But not the 16 next-biggest countries combined, as Naouai claimed on CNN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, <a href=\"http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=476#\"><u>the next 16 biggest militaries spent $801 billion in 2013</u></a>, and the United States spends as much on the military as the next eight&nbsp;countries combined (China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and India).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MvuvlxSQ-QFttgaW15xKFAQysiMBqwKA-go4vTXPQkoUJqQm_9QEq0iAX6MGKkFrNL8eXZ0UJkIgC996r8szENeThW0aZPgtMbvGIN3_DTGO77SClJ4vMLCw7mka9vBZGg\" style=\"height:350px; width:397px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Graphic: Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The International Institute for Strategic Studies only makes the top 15 spenders available for free.
