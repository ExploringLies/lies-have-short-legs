Morgan Carroll, an Aurora Democrat. Its mailer focused on reproductive rights, abortion and <em>Roe v. Wade</em>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the email, titled &quot;2016 goal: A Congress that fights for women and families,&quot; Emily&#39;s List said, &quot;We wish Congress was less like this&quot; -- citing Mike Coffman&#39;s co-sponsorship of the 2011 bill -- &quot;and more like this &hellip; Morgan Carroll sponsored a bill to make emergency contraception available to sexual assault survivors.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to check the accuracy of Emily&#39;s List&#39;s characterization of Coffman&#39;s role in the legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr3/text/rh#compare=ih\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Coffman did co-sponsor the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortions Act</u></a>, which attempted to redefine a ban on federal funding for abortions to exempt &quot;forcible rape&quot; -- and not rape in broader terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Critics said the &quot;forcible rape&quot; language could rule out other forms of sexual assault that are considered rape, including statutory rape, attacks where women are drugged or threatened, and date rapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facing a backlash from women&#39;s groups, Republicans amended the bill in committee to remove the word &quot;forcible&quot; and make the exemption for &quot;rape.&quot; Coffman wasn&#39;t on this committee and didn&#39;t vote on the removal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The bill was amended in committee, and Congressman Coffman supported the amended bill on the floor,&quot; a Coffman campaign spokesman later said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll292.xml\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Congressional records show that Coffman voted for the amended bill in a floor vote</u></a>, which passed the House but not the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, Coffman has tempered his position on abortion in one of the country&#39;s most competitive &quot;swing&quot; districts, which is nearly evenly divided among Democrats, Republicans and independents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, he said, &quot;I am against all abortions, except when it is necessary to protect the life of the mother.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But <a href=\"https://coffman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/representative-coffman-s-statement-on-hr-1797\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a year later</u></a>, Coffman said that while he supported a House bill to limit late-term abortions, &quot;I strongly support the exceptions for rape, incest, and protecting the life of the mother that have been included in this legislation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coffman&#39;s Democratic opponent, Morgan Carroll, had blunt criticism of his co-sponsoring the 2011 bill&#39;s original &quot;forcible rape&quot; language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Rape is about the lack of consent -- not the degree of force -- and this definition takes us backwards,&quot; Carroll told Denver7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I unequivocally support a woman&#39;s right to make her own decisions about her own body, including her health care,&quot; she said. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coffman&#39;s spokeswoman complained that political opponents have repeatedly raised the 2011 bill and &quot;will twist the facts any way they can in an attempt to mischaracterize and demonize Rep.
