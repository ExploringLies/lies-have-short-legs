It's a belief Barack shares &mdash; a belief at the heart of his life's work. ...\n</p>\n<p>\n \"It's what he did in the Illinois Senate, moving people from welfare to jobs, passing tax cuts for hard-working families, and making sure women get equal pay for equal work.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Here, we'll look at a claim\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/540/\">\n  we checked previously\n </a>\n , that Obama won \"tax cuts for hard-working families.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n In 2000, the Illinois legislature created a state earned income tax credit, based on the federal earned income tax program, which is a tax credit for low-income working individuals and families. The program is meant \"to offset the burden of Social Security taxes and to provide an incentive to work,\" according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the federal version, when the tax credit exceeds the amount of taxes owed, it results in a tax refund to those who qualify. In the Illinois bill that Obama co-sponsored, state taxes can go to zero, but there is no additional refund.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the 2000 legislation, the legislative record shows that Obama was one of more than 40 senators who co-sponsored the bill, with most of them signing up for it on the same day.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the bill had a sunset clause, and when it came time to renew it in 2003, Obama filed the bill and was its chief sponsor. Another 20 senators signed on to co-sponsor it. Rather than renewing it for another few years, the Obama bill made the state earned income tax credit permanent, and it allowed for a refund if state funds were available.\n</p>\n<p>\n The record shows Obama was a minor co-sponsor in cutting taxes in 2000 and was the leader in the state Senate in 2003 in making the tax credits permanent. It takes more than one person to pass a bill, and although he played a significant role in making the tax credits permanent, the record on Obama's statement supports only a Mostly True.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:05.630355", "ruling_date": "2008-08-25T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Obama sponsored earned income tax credit", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-sponsored-earned-income-tax-credit", "ruling_link_text": "Obama sponsored earned income tax credit", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Illinois Legislature,\n<a href=\"http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/legisnet91/status/910HB3939.html\">\n 91st General Assembly; Status of HB3939\n</a>\n, became public law on May 11, 2000\n<p>\n Illinois Legislature,\n <a href=\"http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?GA=93&amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;DocNum=4&amp;GAID=3&amp;SessionID=3&amp;LegID=85\">\n  Bill Status of SB0004; 93rd General Assembly\n </a>\n , became public law Aug. 18, 2003\n</p>\n<p>\n Chicago Tribune, \"Obama's record a plus, a minus; Votes in Senate defy easy labels,\" Oct. 8, 2004\n</p>\n<p>\n Internal Revenue Service,\n <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=96406,00.html\">\n  The Earned Income Tax Credit\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Michelle", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 58, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "michelle-obama", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-michelleobama.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/58/", "total_count": 10, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://www.barackobama.com/learn/meet.php#michelle"}, "statement": "While in the Illinois Senate, Barack Obama passed \"tax cuts for hard-working families.\"", "statement_context": "Denver", "statement_date": "2008-08-25", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
