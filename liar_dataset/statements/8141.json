That was the general gist of an opinion piece Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum recently published in the Statesman Journal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article was a chance for her to introduce Oregonians to a &quot;rebooted and revamped foreclosure mediation program.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Homes are selling quicker and for more money,&quot; Rosenblum wrote. &quot;Foreclosures, thankfully, are down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, she continued, &quot;we&rsquo;re not all the way back. The hangover from the housing crash lingers for thousands of Oregonians. Nearly 29,000 Oregonians &mdash; almost 5 percent of all homeowners &mdash; are 90 days or more delinquent on their mortgage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This caught our attention. We were curious not only whether the numbers she used were right, but whether the 5 percent figure she referenced was actually all that much higher than where we were before this whole recession began.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, we contacted Jeff Manning, Rosenblum&rsquo;s spokesman. He told us their office got the numbers from Oregon Housing and Community Services, an agency that deals with state housing policy. That agency, in turn, had gotten the figures from a business called CoreLogic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CoreLogic is a company that specializes in information, data and analytics. In past news reports, The Oregonian has relied on its data regarding foreclosures and delinquency rates. We gave CoreLogic a call and got ahold of Andrea Hurst, who handles communications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was able to send us a spreadsheet with the number of homeowners 90 days or more delinquent on their mortage for each month between January 2009 and May 2013. And, Rosenblum was right: the most recent figures put Oregon&rsquo;s delinquency rate at 4.88 percent (or almost 5 percent). But, we came up short in two areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, there was no raw figure of how many homes that 4.88 percent figure represented. Second, we didn&rsquo;t have much in the way of a baseline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See, the figure for January 2009 was a considerably lower 2.92 percent, but we wanted something from before the recession began. Generally, economists cite December 2007 as the turning point. The folks over at CoreLogic, however, couldn&rsquo;t get us numbers stretching back that far. Manning, however, said that he had them and sent us over a spreadsheet that begins tracking monthly rates with January 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From January 2006 through November 2007, the average monthly delinquency rate was 0.73 percent, according to the data Manning sent us. In fact, in those 24 months it went over 1 percent once: In November 2007, when the rate began a fairly rapid rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numbers Manning sent also backed up the 29,000 figure Rosenblum used (technically the number of homes more than 90 days delinquent was 28,891 in May 2013.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, we never like using data we get from the source that made the claim, so we asked Manning how he got these figures from CoreLogic when we couldn&rsquo;t. He pointed us to Ben Pray with Oregon Housing and Community Services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pray told us his department subscribes to data service from CoreLogic and he simply ran a data request for Rosenblum a week ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also did one last quick check to make sure that figures in the limited data set CoreLogic gave us matched with what Manning and Pray had given us. They did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are, of course, other companies that try to discern and report delinquency rates and the figures can vary depending on which you use. However, CoreLogic&rsquo;s data is the same data used by the federal reserve. If it&rsquo;s good enough for them, we figure it&rsquo;s good enough for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In introducing a revised mediation program, Rosenblum wrote that the housing crash lingers and that nearly 5 percent of all homeowners are more than 90 days delinquent on their mortgage. We verified that her figures were right and that 5 percent does, indeed, represent a number well above what we&rsquo;d experience before the recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-08-09T18:19:42.449817", "ruling_date": "2013-08-09T15:19:03", "ruling_headline": "Are 5 percent of homeowners really 90 days or more behind on their mortgages?", "ruling_headline_slug": "are-5-percent-homeowners-really-90-days-or-behind-", "ruling_link_text": "Just below 5 percent, which is still fairly high.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview with and e-mail from Ben Pray, Oregon Housing and Community Services, August 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with and e-mail from Jeff Manning, Oregon Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, August 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CoreLogic Data, August 6 and 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ellen Rosenblum, <a href=\"http://www.statesmanjournal.com/article/20130804/OPINION/308040024\">Revamped foreclosure mediation is a win-win</a>, August 3, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with and e-mail from Andrea Hurst, CoreLogic spokeswoman, August 7, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Ellen", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 1822, "last_name": "Rosenblum", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "ellen-rosenblum", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rosenblum.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1822/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says &quot;nearly 29,000 Oregonians &mdash; almost 5 percent of all homeowners &mdash; are 90 days or more delinquent on their mortgage.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an opinion article", "statement_date": "2013-08-03", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 106, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/106/", "subject": "Housing", "subject_slug": "housing", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
