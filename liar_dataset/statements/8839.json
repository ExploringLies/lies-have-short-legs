But we have to act with more urgency &ndash; because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal cities dealing with floods.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether Obama was correct that &quot;over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We turned to data from the <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=90&amp;pid=44&amp;aid=8&amp;cid=regions&amp;syid=2003&amp;eyid=2011&amp;unit=MMTCD\"><u>Energy Information Administration</u></a>, a trusted source for all types of energy data run by the U.S. Energy Department. The agency has a table showing &quot;total carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption of energy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data shows a mixed picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama is correct if you measure the total reduction in carbon emissions. Between 2003 and 2011 -- the latest eight-year period for which data is available -- the United States&rsquo; carbon emissions fell from 5.853 billion metric tons to 5.490 billion metric tons. That&rsquo;s a reduction of 363 million metric tons -- far larger than any other country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the statistic is not as enlightening as it would seem, because it fails to account for the relative size of countries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA more useful comparison is to measure&nbsp;the <em>percentage </em>reduction for countries all around the world. We looked at the largest nations -- those with at least 100 million tons of carbon emissions in 2011 -- and found six other nations that managed to cut their carbon emissions more steeply than the United States did during the past eight years. They are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Greece</strong>: -15 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Germany</strong>: -14 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>United Kingdom</strong>: - 13 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Belgium</strong>: -13 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>France</strong>: -8 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spain</strong>: -8 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>United States</strong>: -6 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be fair, many nations increased their emissions over that period -- including such big economies as China, India and Russia -- and in this context, the scale of the United States&rsquo; cuts is impressive. Still, this suggests that a half-dozen advanced industrialized economies made emissions cuts that were larger, proportionately, than the United States achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama said, &quot;Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.&quot; Looked at by the total amount of emission reductions, Obama is right. But when you look at the scale of the cuts proportionately -- which puts nations on a more equal footing when making comparisons -- the United States did not achieve the kind of steep cuts that other industrialized countries did. We rate the claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-01-28T22:59:06.849324", "ruling_date": "2014-01-28T23:13:15", "ruling_headline": "Barack Obama, in State of the Union, says U.S. has cut carbon pollution more than any other country", "ruling_headline_slug": "barack-obama-state-union-says-us-has-cut-carbon-po", "ruling_link_text": "Not if you measure cuts by percentage", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Barack Obama, State of the Union Address, Jan. 28, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy Information Administration, <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=90&amp;pid=44&amp;aid=8&amp;cid=regions&amp;syid=2003&amp;eyid=2011&amp;unit=MMTCD\"><u>Total Carbon Dioxide Emissions from the Consumption of Energy</u></a>, accessed Jan. 28, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "the State of the Union address", "statement_date": "2014-01-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 5, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/5/", "subject": "Environment", "subject_slug": "environment", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
