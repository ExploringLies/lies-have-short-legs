Combined, the events offered a preview of how each will spend the coming months positioning himself as the candidate who can steer an economic recovery.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe dueling speeches were considered far and wide to represent a key moment, given that it was the first time Obama and Romney had campaigned in the same state on the same day. &nbsp;Leaving aside the rhetoric, PolitiFact Ohio decided to look closer at the numbers the president used to make his case. In particular, two figures Obama shared at Tri-C caught our attention.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Over the last few decades,&quot; Obama said early in his 53-minute speech, &quot;the income of the top 1 percent grew by more than 275 percent -- to an average of $1.3 million a year.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe president had painted a picture of inequality. But was it an accurate one?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s start with the first half of the statement. Data released last October by the independent Congressional Budget Office shows that, on average, those Americans among the richest 1 percent saw their after-tax household income rise 275 percent between 1979 and 2007.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose not quite as prosperous but nonetheless among the top 20 percent saw income grow by 65 percent over that period. Middle-class incomes grew roughly 40 percent. And among the bottom 20 percent, income was about 18 percent higher in 2007 than in 1979.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo while income increased across the board, the top 1 percent easily outpaced the pack.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;As a result of that uneven income growth, the distribution of after-tax household income in the United States was substantially more unequal in 2007 than in 1979,&quot; the CBO reported. &quot;In fact, between 2005 and 2007, the after-tax income received by the 20 percent of the population with the highest income exceeded the after-tax income of the remaining 80 percent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second half of Obama&rsquo;s statement can be traced to a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 developed countries that sets international standards on a wide range of topics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report, released in December and titled &quot;Divided We Stand: Why Inequality Keeps Rising,&quot; found that, on average, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans earned $1.3 million a year after taxes. Though Obama didn&rsquo;t mention it in his speech, that figure dwarfs the average $17,700 made by the poorest 20 percent, according to the OECD.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBefore we get to the Truth-O-Meter, there are three points worth raising.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, while Obama said that growth for the richest 1 percent was more than 275 percent, the CBO study adds no such quantifier. The president indulged in some hyperbole, but not so much that it created a false impression that the disparity is measurably larger than it is.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecond, Obama time-pegged his assertion to &quot;the last few decades.&quot; Obama&rsquo;s speech focused singularly on the policies of his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush. Also in the White House during those decades were two Democrats: Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe third point comes via the Washington Post. When fact-checking Obama&rsquo;s Tri-C speech, the Post&rsquo;s Glenn Kessler noted that while it&rsquo;s accurate that the average income among the top 1 percent is $1.3 million, describing top earners that way is &quot;an interesting sleight of hand.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the CBO, you&rsquo;re in the top 1 percent if your household income exceeds $352,000. &quot;By using an average,&quot; Kessler wrote, &quot;Obama is able to cite a much higher figure.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it&rsquo;s also important to stress that the numbers Obama used come from agencies respected for independence. These three points, while helpful in painting a fuller picture, do not diminish the accuracy of the numbers or the context in which the president delivered them. Knowing them, though, provides some clarification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs such, we rate Obama&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-27T17:38:37.098939", "ruling_date": "2012-06-28T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Barack Obama says income for top earners up 275 percent since 1979", "ruling_headline_slug": "barack-obama-says-income-top-earners-275-percent-1", "ruling_link_text": "They don't all make $1.3 million - range is $352,000 and up", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Plain Dealer, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2012/06/president_barack_obama_reframe.html\">President Barack Obama reframes economic message as he and Mitt Romney stump in Ohio</a>,&quot;&nbsp;June 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe White House Office of the Press Secretary, transcript of president&rsquo;s remarks at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, June 14, 2012&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/10-25-HouseholdIncome.pdf\">Trends in the Distribution of Household Income Between 1979 and 2007</a>,&quot;&nbsp;released in October 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/40/23/49170253.pdf\">Divided We Stand: Why Inequality Keeps Rising - Country Note: United States</a>,&quot;&nbsp;released Dec. 5, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/fact-checking-the-dueling-obama-and-romney-economic-speeches/2012/06/14/gJQAwbSRdV_blog.html\">Fact checking the dueling Obama and Romney economic speeches</a>,&quot;&nbsp;June 15, 2012;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office fact sheet, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/income_ranges2010.pdf\">Income Category Minimums for All Households</a>,&quot;&nbsp;for years 1979-2007, accessed June 26, 2012, at CBO.gov</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Over the last few decades, the income of the top 1 percent grew by more than 275 percent -- to an average of $1.3 million a year.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign speech", "statement_date": "2012-06-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 184, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/184/", "subject": "Income", "subject_slug": "income", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 258, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/258/", "subject": "Wealth", "subject_slug": "wealth", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/14/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
