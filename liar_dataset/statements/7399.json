Ted Cruz, who <a href=\"http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2013/02/democrats-paint-sen-ted-cruz-as-latter-day-mccarthy-over-hagel-insinuations.html/\">has drawn fire</a> from Democrats for his questions of Chuck Hagel, maintains that critics overlook his positive references to Hagel, the former two-term Nebraska senator <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/07/remarks-president-nomination-secretary-defense-and-cia-director\">nominated</a> for secretary of Defense.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt Hagel&rsquo;s confirmation hearings, Cruz employed video clips of Hagel being interviewed by Al-Jazeera to suggest the nominee espoused views hostile to Israel, Politico <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/texas-senator-ted-cruz-87696.html?hp=t2_3\">summarized</a> Feb. 14, 2013, and during a committee vote, Cruz criticized Hagel&rsquo;s failure to reveal details of his personal compensation from 2008 to 2010, asking whether North Korean sources may have funneled $200,000 to the defense nominee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe senator&rsquo;s questions are not attacks, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier later said, according to a Feb. 14, 2013, <a href=\"http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2013/02/democrats-paint-sen-ted-cruz-as-latter-day-mccarthy-over-hagel-insinuations.html/\">post</a> on the <em>Dallas Morning News</em>&rsquo; Trailblazers blog. Frazier continued: &quot;Sen. Cruz has repeatedly praised Chuck Hagel&rsquo;s character, patriotism, bravery, and personal service defending our nation &mdash; at the confirmation hearing, in writing, and at the committee hearing casting his vote on Senator Hagel&rsquo;s nomination.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe has?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPresident Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/07/remarks-president-nomination-secretary-defense-and-cia-director\">announced</a> his nomination of <a href=\"http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=h001028\">Hagel</a>, a Vietnam War veteran and former newscaster who served as a Republican senator through early 2009, on Jan. 7, 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <em>Morning News</em> <a href=\"http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2013/02/democrats-paint-sen-ted-cruz-as-latter-day-mccarthy-over-hagel-insinuations.html/\">report</a> opened by saying that Cruz, a freshman Republican, was being likened by critics to Joe McCarthy, the late Wisconsin senator whose crusade against communists in government devolved into doubts about his legitimacy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Feb. 12, 2013, as the Senate Armed Services Committee approved Hagel&rsquo;s nomination on a 14-11 party line vote, the <em>News</em> said, Cruz suggested that Hagel had taken money under the table from adversaries. &quot;We do not know, for example, if he received compensation for giving paid speeches at extreme or radical groups,&quot; Cruz said before the committee vote. &quot;It is at a minimum relevant to know if that $200,000 that he deposited in his bank account came directly from Saudi Arabia, came directly from North Korea.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCruz demanded financial disclosures from Hagel covering five years, three more than required, the <em>News</em> reported, and the Texan said that without that, the &quot;only reasonable inference&quot; is that &quot;there was something in there that they did not want to make public.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the hearing, Politico <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/texas-senator-ted-cruz-87696.html?hp=t2_3\">reported</a>, Sens. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and John McCain, R-Ariz., rebuked Cruz for &quot;what they considered an unfair line of questioning allegedly impugning Hagel&rsquo;s patriotism.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNelson chastised Cruz for violating standards of &quot;comity and civility that this committee has always been known for&hellip;.To question in essence whether somebody is a fellow traveler with another country, I think is taking it too far&hellip;.You basically have impugned the patriotism of the nominee.&quot;<br class=\"kix-line-break\" />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSubsequently, the <em>News</em> said, left-leaning pundits compared Cruz&rsquo;s statement to those aired during the 1950s Red Scare &ndash; intimidation by insinuation. Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., referred to Cruz&rsquo;s assertions as &quot;innuendo&quot; that lacked factual basis. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., made an allusion to McCarthy, recalling a time when senators would make insinuations by claiming to have a speech someone once made in his pocket, casting aspersions without producing evidence. &quot;It was reminiscent of some bad times,&quot; she said, according to the <em>News</em>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy email, Frazier told us that Cruz&rsquo;s praise of Hagel shows up in video of the committee proceedings, committee transcripts and published articles by Cruz.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCruz&rsquo;s Jan. 7, 2013, <em>USA Today</em> opinion <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/01/07/chuck-hagel-ted-cruz/1816031/\">column</a> opens by calling Hagel a &quot;war hero and public official who has served America honorably. However,&quot; it continues, &quot;his views on foreign and defense policy are out of the mainstream, and he is not a good fit for secretary of Defense.&quot; The remaining 280 words give reasons not to back Hagel.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Cruz <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/chuck-hagels-confirmation-day-conversion-87046.html\">opinion column</a> posted by Politico on Feb. 1, 2013, opens: &quot;Chuck Hagel is a decorated Vietnam veteran with an honorable history fighting for his country, and I commend his personal valor and sacrifice.&quot; The rest of the 800-word article covers Cruz concerns about the nominee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCruz praised Hagel in two moments during meetings of the Armed Services committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Jan. 31, 2013, according to a hearing transcript, Cruz prefaced his questioning of Hagel by saying: &quot;I want to begin by thanking you for your honorable service to our nation, for your personal sacrifice that you have put in to standing and fighting for this country.&quot; And on Feb. 12, Cruz prefaced his echo of a newspaper saying Hagel&rsquo;s foreign policy views put him on the Senate&rsquo;s fringe by saying: &quot;And Sen. Hagel, although I very much respect his personal heroism and character and service, putting his life on the line defending this nation,&quot; according to a transcript.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCruz separately <a href=\"http://www.cruz.senate.gov/press.cfm\">issued press releases</a> questioning Hagel&rsquo;s nomination on Jan. 7 and Feb. 14, 2013. The combined 324 words include no praise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCruz&rsquo;s office says he has &quot;repeatedly praised&quot; Hagel&rsquo;s &quot;character, patriotism, bravery, and personal service defending our nation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found four instances, but in each one--and in others where he aired no praise--Cruz hammered what he calls Hagel&rsquo;s shortcomings so much so that some colleagues cried foul. The missing context of this claim is that every time, Cruz&#39;s praise has been overshadowed by pointed questions and/or critiques.
