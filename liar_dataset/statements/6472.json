Over 6 percent of its power comes from wind and a Danish turbine maker recently built a manufacturing plant there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the industry is fragile and Obama played to that when he said, &quot;At a moment when homegrown energy is creating new jobs in states like Colorado and Iowa, my opponent wants to end tax credits for wind producers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama was referring to Renewable Energy Production Tax Credits. The president says Mitt Romney wants to get rid of them -- and the Romney campaign agrees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Romney spokesman, Ryan Williams, says when the tax credits expire at the end of this year, Romney has no plans to renew them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Wind energy will thrive wherever it is economically competitive,&quot; Williams said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&#39;s worth noting that Romney&#39;s position on the tax breaks for wind energy is a major issue within the wind power industry.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese tax credits have been part of American energy policy since 1992. For every kilowatt hour of power from wind, the government gives the producer a tax credit worth 2.2 cents. If the average price of electricity is around 8.5 cents, as it was in Colorado in <a href=\"http://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/state-regs/pdf/Colorado.pdf\">2010,</a> then the tax break can make wind power more competitive.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe tax credit has come and gone over the years. Investment analyst, Aris Karcanias, managing consultant at Navigant BTM, says as the tax credit goes, so goes the wind industry.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The Production Tax Credit remains the largest driver of industry growth in the United States,&quot; Karcanias said. &quot;And uncertainty over its renewal has historically been accompanied by repeated &lsquo;boom and bust&rsquo; cycles of growth.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe past few years have been one of the &quot;boom&quot;&nbsp; times. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that wind projects created at least <a href=\"http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/52739.pdf\">52,000 jobs</a> between 2009 and 2011. The Congressional Research Service reports that the country will add a record <a href=\"http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/R42576.pdf\">10 to 12 gigawatts</a> of capacity by the end of 2012.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter the policy runs out, new construction is expected to plummet. But the congressional analysts don&rsquo;t say that extending it would necessarily lead to an upswing. They say that competition from cheap natural gas and a limited rise in the demand for power will tend to put a damper on the industry regardless of federal tax policy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our Ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarack Obama said Mitt Romney plans to put an end to tax credits that benefit the wind power industry.
