Marcy Kaptur took the the pages of &quot;Politico&quot; to offer him <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/54537.html\" target=\"blank\">advice</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn suggesting that the Defense Department needs to cut back on its use of petroleum products, the Toledo Democrat said:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Even before the oil companies and Wall Street speculators drove up the price of gasoline close to $4 a gallon, the landed cost of a gallon delivered to the front lines for our troops in Afghanistan cost more than $400.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio already thought gas prices in Ohio were outrageous, but the idea of spending $400 per gallon boggles the mind. So we decided to look into the claim by Kaptur, a member of <a href=\"http://democrats.appropriations.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83&amp;Itemid=18\" target=\"blank\">the House Appropriations subcommittee that funds the Pentagon</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe started with Kaptur&rsquo;s office. Her staff said she gleaned her information from testimony delivered to her subcommittee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/63407-400gallon-gas-another-cost-of-war-in-afghanistan-\" target=\"blank\">2009 report in The Hill</a>, a Washington publication, recounted some of that testimony. The Pentagon comptroller&rsquo;s office gave appropriators that statistic to explain the high cost of keeping troops in Afghanistan. It factors in the transportation and security costs of transporting the fuel into areas with a lack of infrastructure, challenging geography and increased roadside bomb attacks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It turns out that when you factor in the cost of transportation to a coastal facility in Pakistan, or airlifting it to Kandahar - and then you add the cost of putting it in a truck, guarding it, delivering it to the battlefield, and then transferring that one gallon into a piece of equipment that needs it - in extreme cases that gallon of gasoline could cost up to $400,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.navy.mil/navydata/people/secnav/Mabus/Speech/SECNAV%20Energy%20Forum%2014%20Oct%2009%20Rel1.pdf\" target=\"blank\">Navy Secretary Ray Mabus told a 2009 Naval Energy </a><a href=\"http://www.navy.mil/navydata/people/secnav/Mabus/Speech/SECNAV%20Energy%20Forum%2014%20Oct%2009%20Rel1.pdf\" target=\"blank\">Forum</a>in Virginia.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne U.S. Army official has said the &quot;fully burdened&quot; cost of transporting fuel into remote areas can be as high as $1,000 per gallon.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In some places you have to fly it in by plane or by helicopter and drop off bladders of fuel,&quot; Kevin T. Geiss, program director for energy and partnerships in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations and Environment <a href=\"http://www.army.mil/-news/2009/07/16/24504-beans-bullets-and-btus-define-army-energy-security/\" target=\"blank\">told Army News Service</a>. &quot;Those costs can be an additional $20, $40 or even $200 a gallon.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHigh fuel costs in military battlegrounds predate U.S. military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. A May 2001 Defense Science Board report cites the true cost of military fuel at &quot;$17.50 per gallon for USAF worldwide tanker-delivered fuel, and hundreds of dollars per gallon for Army forces deep into the battlespace.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRetired Army Brigadier General Steven M. Anderson, who handled military logistics operations for Gen. David Petraeus in Iraq during 2006 and 2007, offers a slightly different picture -- that the cost of bringing gasoline to troops in Afghanistan actually works out to be at least $30 per gallon, and is possibly as high in the mid-40s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe told a Capitol Hill Briefing on fuel convoys in Afghanistan and Iraq that it cost about $13.88 per gallon to transport a gallon of gas to troops in Iraq when he worked there in 2007, and the amount has risen since then to $17.44 cents per gallon. He explained that it&rsquo;s more expensive to bring gas to Afghanistan because &quot;Iraq is a land of six lane highways from one end to the other&quot; while &quot;Afghanistan is perhaps the most isolated country in the entire world.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said the $400 per gallon figure for gas that others have cited for Afghanistan applies only when fuel must be brought by aircraft to the most remote areas.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If we&rsquo;re flying water up there, it&rsquo;s $400 per gallon, or toothpaste or whatever,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;Anything that flies is expensive.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRetired Air Force Lt. General Norman R. Seip, who spoke at the same event, described the $400 per gallon cost as a &quot;worst case scenario,&quot; that accounts for a tanker providing airborne refueling to a cargo plane. He said the lower figures are more reasonable.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo where does that leave Kaptur&rsquo;s statement?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNumerous sources have said it can cost as much as $400 per gallon to provide gas for troops in Afghanistan. That the statistic seems to be a high end number is a piece of information that provides clarification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, we rate her statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2011/05/rep_marcy_kaptur_says_gasoline.html\" target=\"blank\">Comment on this item</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-22T12:09:10.266495", "ruling_date": "2011-05-23T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
