It has been wrongly cited by Hillary Clinton, Colin Powell, and opinion columnists for the Post and <em><a href=\"http://www.haskins.yale.edu/newsrelease/ReadingCzar.html\">New York Times</a></em>&nbsp;and debunked by <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2009/06/virginia-myths-and-more/\">FactCheck.org</a>&nbsp;and the<em> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/03/AR2009060303566.html\">Washington Post</a>.</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tFord went one step further by focusing on private prison operators and the number of third graders, not academic performance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tHer claim is &quot;nonsense,&quot; said Peter Leone, a University of Maryland education professor who specializes in behavioral disorders and school discipline. Leone was the director of the National Center on Education, Disability and Juvenile Justice, which during its operation from 1999 to 2006 <a href=\"http://www.edjj.org/prevention/phcsc.html\">produced a report</a> touting that &quot;at least one state&quot; uses third-grade reading scores to project future prison bed needs. Leone told us the statement was made by a colleague &quot;before he got the facts.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;It is an urban legend that politicians like to trot out to claim that either the schools are failing or that we are not tough enough on crime,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe ran Ford&rsquo;s words by two of the largest private prison operators in the country, Corrections Corporation of America, a Tennessee company that manages five prison facilities in Florida, and Management and Training Corporation, which manages one prison in Florida.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSpokesmen for both companies denied Ford&rsquo;s claim. Private prisons respond to inmate projections from the state government, so it would not make sense for them to do their own forecasting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;This is truly the urban myth that will not die,&quot; said CCA spokesman Steve Owen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tFord directed us to the spring 2012 <a href=\"http://www.doc.nv.gov/sites/doc/files/pdf/education/Education_Services_Spring_2012_Newsletter.pdf\">newsletter</a>&nbsp;of the Nevada Department of Corrections. The newsletter does not speak to her exact point, but it does mention children who do not read on grade level are more likely to dropout, use drugs or end up in prison.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n\t<em>So many nonreaders wind up in jail that officials have found they can use the rate of illiteracy to help calculate future prison needs. Indiana&rsquo;s former governor has stated that determining the number of new prisons to build is based, in part, on the number of second graders not reading at second-grade level. In California they plan how many jail cells they will build in the future by how many children are not reading on grade level by third grade.</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut neither Indiana nor California does what Nevada claims it does, officials at those states told us. Neither does Nevada.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMike Schmoker, an independent education consultant, made a similar claim in a 1999 <em>Education Week </em>article. He told us he could not verify the claim and does not make it any longer. Mike Tikkanen of Invisible Children, whose <a href=\"http://www.invisiblechildren.org/tag/failed-third-grade-reading-scores/\">website</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Children-Mike-Tikkanen/dp/1931945349\">book</a> use the statistic, said &quot;no state today admits to it, nor have I been able to find those references.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn Florida, the Office of Economic and Demographic Research estimates future inmate populations through a variety of factors, including historical trends using the state crime rate and the number of arrests and convictions. &quot;Educational attainment is not one of them,&quot; said EDR director Amy Baker.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn making the case for focusing more on education, St. Petersburg mayoral candidate Kathleen Ford said, &quot;We know that our private prison systems are calculating how many new beds (they will need) based on the third grade, number of third graders, and that&rsquo;s just wrong.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a spin-off of an urban legend.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome of the largest private prison operators in the country say they get their estimates from the states.
