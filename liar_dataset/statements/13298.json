Council chairman when the ban was enacted. &quot;We had to isolate and contain the problem. We thought a handgun law would do that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Passed in the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/17/AR2007071700689.html\">mid 1970s</a>, the ordinance continued with several legal challenges until 2007, when a federal court invalidated the law. That decision was upheld in a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling that the handgun ban and &quot;trigger lock&quot; provisions of the ordinance <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2007/07-290\">violated</a> the Second Amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the Supreme Court ruling, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/04/AR2007090400474.html\">city leaders</a> fought hard to keep the ban, saying that its continued implementation reduced the number of stolen firearms and guns used in other crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their appeal to the Supreme Court, the city government <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/DC_Final_Petition.pdf\">filed a petition</a> with the court specifically citing the dangers posed to children if the gun ban was lifted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The smaller the weapon, the more likely a child can use it, and children as young as three years old are strong enough to fire today&rsquo;s handguns,&quot; the petition stated <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/DC_Final_Petition.pdf\">(page 25</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same petition also addressed the history of the ban, saying that in 1976 that the Council determined existing law didn&rsquo;t sufficiently address gun violence and specifically <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/DC_Final_Petition.pdf\">cited</a> the &quot;chilling regularity with which handguns were taking the lives of children.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But protecting children isn&rsquo;t the only reason cited by the 30-page petition filed by the city&rsquo;s government &mdash; the city also addressed general violent crime trends and other legal arguments in asking the Supreme Court to hear the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the court&rsquo;s decision in <em>Heller</em> went far beyond just overturning the city&rsquo;s gun ban, as it broadly affirmed for the first time an individual right to private gun ownership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s campaign referred us to a <a href=\"http://smartgunlaws.org/tag/child-access-prevention/\">gun control group</a> claiming that gun locks and child access prevention laws help prevent unintentional firearm deaths for young children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/28/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-after-dc-passed-gun-laws-viol/\">PolitiFact</a> has previously looked into whether the city&rsquo;s gun ban had any effect on violent crime, finding that violent crime levels varied year-to-year and that other social and demographic factors played a larger role than gun laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said her opposition to the 2008 <em>Heller</em> case was because &quot;what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>City leaders did specifically cite the danger posed to children in trying to keep in place gun regulations, but the regulations were also a widespread ban on unregistered weapons, not just gun safety measures. Child safety wasn&rsquo;t the sole topic cited by defenders of the city&rsquo;s gun control ordinance, and the <em>Heller</em> decision dealt with a much broader issue than protecting toddlers from firearm deaths or injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a1279632-b0c9-4856-8bc2-c64555f9f78f\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a1279632-b0c9-4856-8bc2-c64555f9f78f</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-19T21:25:03.115558", "ruling_date": "2016-10-19T22:52:05", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton says Supreme Court gun decision dealt with protecting toddlers", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-says-supreme-court-gun-decision-de", "ruling_link_text": "Heller broader than just toddlers", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin, Oct. 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oyez, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2007/07-290\">District of Columbia v.
