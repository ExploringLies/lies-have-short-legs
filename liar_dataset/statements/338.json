Barack Obama's record on abortion rights because he voted \"present\" rather than \"no\" on seven antiabortion bills when he was in the Illinois state Senate.\n<p>\n The day before the Super Tuesday primaries, an e-mail from the head of the Connecticut National Organization for Women took issue with those votes, prompting a response from U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, an Obama supporter, who said the effort by NOW was divisive.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"The facts are clear &ndash; in the Illinois state Senate, choice advocates asked strong prochoice legislators like Senator Obama to vote 'present' on Republican-designed bills like a ban on partial-birth abortion to protect a woman's right to chose,\" DeLauro wrote. \"Senator Obama has always had a 100 percent prochoice rating.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n We're addressing the votes with\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/339/\">\n  this item\n </a>\n and\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2008/feb/06/obama-abortion-debate/\">\n  this article,\n </a>\n so here we'll focus on Obama's record.\n</p>\n<p>\n Indeed, DeLauro is correct. Obama has 100 percent congressional voting ratings from NARAL Prochoice America for his three years in the U.S. Senate. The Planned Parenthood Action Fund similarly gave Obama a perfect score on its 2006 congressional scorecard.\n</p>\n<p>\n He also earned 100 percent records for his votes in eight years as a state senator, according to Pam Sutherland, president and CEO of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council. (She is neutral in the presidential race and her group has not endorsed a candidate.)\n</p>\n<p>\n \"He has always voted in favor of abortion rights,\" she said.\n</p>\n<p>\n So we find DeLauro's statement to be True.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:23.727619", "ruling_date": "2008-02-06T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Obama voted consistently for abortion rights", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-voted-consistently-for-abortion-rights", "ruling_link_text": "Obama voted consistently for abortion rights", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "NARAL Prochoice America,\n<a href=\"http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/elections/statements/obama.html\">\n Obama scorecard\n</a>\n<p>\n Planned Parenthood,\n <a href=\"http://www.ppaction.org/ppvotes/Scorecard.html\">\n  2006 Congressional Scorecard\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Washington Post,\n <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/04/AR2008020402980.html\">\n  NOW Again Attacks Obama's Illinois Voting Record on Abortion Bills,\n </a>\n Feb. 5, 2008\n</p>\n<p>\n Obama campaign,\n <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/factcheck/2008/01/08/fact_check_obamas_strong_proch.php\">\n  Obama's Strong Prochoice Record\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Interview: Pam Sutherland, Illinois Planned Parenthood Council\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "\"Sen.
