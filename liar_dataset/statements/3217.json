Ald. Milele Coggs issued a news release Feb. 3, 2011 criticizing the measure as toughest in the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In its current state, this bill is the most restrictive voter ID legislation in the nation,&quot; Coggs said in a <a href=\"http://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/ccCouncil/2011-PDF/06-15thamendandvoterid-release.pdf\">release</a> commemorating passage of the 15th Amendment, which guaranteed voting rights regardless of race. &quot;It will disproportionately impact people of color, students and the elderly.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe arguments surrounding photo IDs are fierce, including claims about how much such a requirement would reduce voting. We&rsquo;re not ruling on those projections here -- or GOP arguments that the bill is needed to curb fraud.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe are simply testing Coggs&rsquo; contention that the bills is the toughest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked about her claim, Coggs pointed to <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=16602\">data assembled by the National Conference of State </a><a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=16602\">Legislatures</a> on the eight states that currently ask voters for photo ID: Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan and South Dakota.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother 18 states require an ID, but not necessarily a photo. Oklahoma will make 19 as of July 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor now, Wisconsin is among the remaining that require no ID.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCoggs says the heart of the issue is which IDs are deemed acceptable. We think that makes sense, because the pending legislation is all about proof of identity. As a secondary test, we will touch on how states treat voters who forget to bring an ID to the polls.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs things currently stand <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/SB-6.pdf\">in the bill</a>, Wisconsin would accept three sorts of identification: military ID, a driver&rsquo;s license or a state-issued ID.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a much shorter list than in other photo ID states, based on our interviews with state elections officials and the study by the state legislatures group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn contrast, Florida takes 12 different forms, including employee badges, buyer&rsquo;s club cards, retirement center IDs, entertainment cards and public assistance IDs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHawaii is open-ended, requiring a signed picture ID but not limiting what is accepted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA key point in the debate over the measure is whether Wisconsin should accept student IDs. Many students lack Wisconsin driver&rsquo;s licenses and critics question whether they will be motivated enough to go to a state office to get a state ID before &nbsp;voting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll the other photo ID states accept student IDs -- at least from public institutions of higher education. <a href=\"http://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/Notice_To_Voters_209297_7.pdf\">Michigan even </a><a href=\"http://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/Notice_To_Voters_209297_7.pdf\">takes</a> a high school ID.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublicans in Wisconsin so far have resisted calls to allow student IDs, saying there is too much potential for fraud and administrative headaches.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPassports are another difference.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Wisconsin bill would not allow them. All the other photo ID states accept them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAdditionally, tribal IDs are allowed in several states but not in the Wisconsin proposal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat do others think?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDavid Canon, a University of Wisconsin political scientist who has studied election administration nationally, said Coggs&rsquo; claim was right on target.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKevin Kennedy, Wisconsin&rsquo;s elections chief, also said the bill as proposed was the most restrictive in the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Michael Pyritz, considered a leading GOP staff expert on voter ID, agreed that Wisconsin&rsquo;s proposed ID list is narrower than other states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt least it stands right now.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPyritz, an aide to Rep. Jeff Stone (R-Greendale), predicted that GOP lawmakers will move to expand the list of IDs -- something Democratic critics and <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/114657664.html\">state elections </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/114657664.html\">officials</a> have called for.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLawmaker almost certainly will allow the use of passports, Pyritz said. Similarly, he said, tribal IDs will &quot;most likely&quot; will be added in.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStudent IDs are under discussion, but Pyritz said the current conventional wisdom was that would not be added to the bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Wisconsin bill is comparable to -- though still more restrictive than -- a proposal <a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/01/27/2800539/senate-approves-voter-id-legislation.html\">moving swiftly through the Texas Legislature</a>. That plan would allow five forms of ID -- including concealed handgun licenses, passports and state-issued IDs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat covers the IDs themselves. What about those who forget them on election day?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Wisconsin bill is as restrictive -- if not more so -- than the other photo ID states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill would allow a voter to cast a provisional ballot that will count if they show up at their clerk&rsquo;s office within 24 hours of the election with proper ID.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia uses provisional balloting but gives the forgetful voters until the Friday after election day. Indiana allows 10 days.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome states, such as Michigan, allow voters to simply sign an affidavit and vote like any other voter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPyritz said lawmakers are considering a change in the bill to give voters more time to make their provisional ballot count.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis item is clear.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs introduced, the Republican photo ID bill takes a tougher line than the other photo ID states. The number and type of IDs allowed is narrower and the deadlines for alternative voting procedure are tighter. &nbsp;Some of that may change in coming weeks, but Coggs was careful to describe the bill in &quot;its current state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate her statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-11T12:05:17.251910", "ruling_date": "2011-02-15T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Milwaukee Ald.
