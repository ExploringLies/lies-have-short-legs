An economic recovery occurring just because Republicans took over the Senate days earlier?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, did the Kentucky Republican really say what the Milwaukee Democrat said he did?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>McConnell&rsquo;s claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore reacted to comments McConnell made two days earlier on the Senate floor, after he took over as majority leader:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;After so many years of sluggish growth, we&rsquo;re finally starting to see some economic data that can provide a glimmer of hope. The uptick appears to coincide with the biggest political change of the Obama administration&rsquo;s long tenure in Washington: the expectation of a new Republican Congress.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, McConnell was saying a recent economic uptick appears to &quot;coincide&quot; with &quot;the expectation of a new Republican Congress.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National rated that McConnell claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/08/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-economic-uptick-coincides-exp/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>False</u></a>, even leaving aside the question of whether McConnell was crediting the GOP for the uptick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key statistics show the recovery was under way well before September 2014. That&rsquo;s when a consensus emerged expecting that Republicans would win enough seats in the November 2014 elections to win a majority in the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Moore&rsquo;s claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore&rsquo;s characterization of McConnell&rsquo;s remark went a bit further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said McConnell was crediting the GOP for a recovery because it had taken control of the Senate &quot;days ago.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that expectation would have been in place a couple of months earlier, following the elections -- or perhaps a couple of months before that, as it became clear the GOP would win back the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore said McConnell credits Republicans &quot;for recent economic improvements&quot; even though they took control of the Senate only &quot;days ago.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McConnell did say the recovery coincided with the expectation of the GOP taking over the Senate.
