Crimea was part of the Soviet Union until 1954, when Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev gave the territory to Ukraine (more history in this <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/02/david-ignatius/historical-claim-shows-why-crimea-matters-russia/\"><u>fact-check</u></a>).

The<em> Guardian</em> estimates <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/04/ukraine-crisis-russian-troops-crimea-john-kerry-kiev\"><u>16,000 &quot;pro-Russian troops</u></a>&quot; are controlling Crimea and blockading Ukrainian bases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/world/europe/ukraine.html?hp\"><u>March 4 news conference</u></a>, Russian President Vladimir Putin denied Russian troops were occupying Crimea as he said that Russia would only resort to military action &quot;for the protection of the Ukrainian people.&quot; Putin chastised the U.S. government for interfering in Ukraine&rsquo;s affairs like a scientist with rats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are many military uniforms. Go into any local shop and you can find one,&quot; Putin said of the so-called pro-Russia &quot;local defense forces,&quot; according to a translation in the <em>Times.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign journalists <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mfisheroverseas/statuses/440846161071837184\"><u>have challenged</u></a> Putin&rsquo;s claims, often just by asking talkative, possibly bored soldiers if they are Russian military. <em>Guardian</em> Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shaunwalker7/status/440932981276823552\"><u>tweeted</u></a> the soldiers were &quot;forced to keep up &lsquo;volunteer&rsquo; charade,&quot; though one &quot;chatty chap&quot; admitted he was from Russia &quot;to defend against &lsquo;terror&rsquo; &quot; in a video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts we consulted said there&rsquo;s no doubting the troops are Russian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s clear these are Russian special forces in terms of their performance and in terms of their bearing,&quot; said Ariel Cohen, a senior research fellow in Russian and Eurasian studies at the Heritage Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cohen said he was born in Crimea and has friends there who have told him the military men have identified themselves as Russian elite troops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why wouldn&rsquo;t Putin say so? Or why won&rsquo;t Russian soldiers wear patches identifying them as Russian? Plausible deniability, Cohen said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Russians can still deny these are forces that are working under their direction, so it may facilitate walking this back,&quot; Cohen said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There would be nothing new for Russian special forces to be out of uniform in Crimea in an effort to blend in with the locals, said Lance Janda, chairman of Cameron University&#39;s Department of History and Government, adding the U.S. military does that to operate secretly as well. But since it&rsquo;s cold over there, he is also seeing pictures of Russian soldiers bundled up in winter clothes, which are less likely to have unit insignias than combat uniforms, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s also possible that they were ordered to take off unit insignias in order to either confuse the Ukrainians initially or to try and appear a bit less threatening,&quot; Janda said. &quot;In any case, I think it&#39;s an overstatement to stay the Russians were not wearing military uniforms. The safer, more accurate statement would be that some Russian soldiers appear to have not been wearing uniforms.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Janda said the size of the Russian military presence in Crimea &quot;has surely been augmented&quot; since the original reports of 16,000. From a distance, it&rsquo;s hard to tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Janda agrees with Matthews&rsquo; overall assertion that neither side wants a war, and the Russians &quot;are going in as &lsquo;light&rsquo; as they can. ... They just aren&#39;t going to risk losing access to the Crimea.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matthews said, &quot;the Russians didn&rsquo;t wear uniforms when they came in&quot; to Ukraine. To be certain, they are wearing uniforms. But we think a reasonable person would infer Matthews&nbsp; was talking about uniforms that identified them as Russians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That does require a bit of clarification. So we rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-03-04T17:44:32.670502", "ruling_date": "2014-03-04T18:03:21", "ruling_headline": "'Hardball' host Chris Matthews says Russian troops aren't wearing uniforms in Ukraine", "ruling_headline_slug": "hardball-host-chris-matthews-says-russian-troops-a", "ruling_link_text": "They are wearing uniforms, but with no markings", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview with <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/c/ariel-cohen\"><u>Ariel Cohen</u></a>, senior research fellow in Russian and Eurasian studies and international energy policy at Heritage Foundation, March 4, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Lance Janda, Cameron University Department of History and Government chairman, March 4, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Guardian</em>, &quot;Ukraine must focus on where its assets are stationed, experts say,&quot; March 3, 2014 (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/graphic/2014/mar/03/russia-ukraine-military-imbalance-graphic\"><u>infographic on military comparison</u></a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/world/europe/ukraine.html?_r=0\"><u>Ukraine mobilizes reserve troops, threatening war</u></a>,&quot; March 4, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/world/europe/in-crimeas-phantom-war-armed-men-face-unseen-foe.html\"><u>In Crimea&rsquo;s phantom war, armed men face unseen foe</u></a>,&quot; March 2, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reuters, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/01/us-ukraine-crisis-balaclava-idUSBREA200Y520140301\"><u>Sleepy Crimean war turns out for Russian troops</u></a>,&quot; March, 3, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Host of MSNBC's Hardball", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "", "id": 425, "last_name": "Matthews", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "chris-matthews", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/chrismatthews.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/425/", "total_count": 7, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036697/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The Russians didn&rsquo;t wear uniforms when they came in&quot; to Ukraine.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a segment on \"Hardball\"", "statement_date": "2014-03-03", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 30, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/30/", "subject": "Military", "subject_slug": "military", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
