That&rsquo;s about $56 less than U.S. Rep. Chip Cravaack, R-Minn., the top spender among the seven congressmen singled out in the article.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe article says Cravaack is leasing for more than $1,000 a month a <a href=\"http://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/equinox/2011/\">2011 Chevy Equinox</a>, a small SUV crossover, but doesn&rsquo;t say what Duffy has.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Keyes&rsquo; article cites congressional records in claiming that Duffy spent more than $24,000 in tax dollars on a car for personal use, but provides absolutely no evidence of what type of vehicle Duffy has or whether it&rsquo;s for himself.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Reaction</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuffy spokesman John Gentzel said Duffy did, as the article says, spend $24,525 -- but that&rsquo;s for an 18-month lease of a 2001 Chevy Champion <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/seanduffy/5905969384/\">bus</a> that is utilized as a mobile office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGentzel said the converted five-seat bus is used only by staff to provide constituent services around the <a href=\"http://duffy.house.gov/districtmap\">7th Congressional </a><a href=\"http://duffy.house.gov/districtmap\">District</a> in northwestern Wisconsin, which he said is the largest in Wisconsin and the second-largest east of the Mississippi River. It includes Wausau and points south, goes west to Eau Claire and runs northwest almost to Duluth, Minn.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnly four staffers have been authorized and insured to drive the bus, and Duffy has never driven it, Gentzel said. Indeed, he rarely rides in it, Gentzel said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe vehicle has made 230 stops in all 20 of the district&rsquo;s counties since it was put into service in July 2011, and makes visits on a posted <a href=\"http://duffy.house.gov/events\">schedule</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;d be a flat-out lie to suggest or imply (Duffy) has ever driven it or used it as a personal vehicle,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Keyes is way off when he wrote that Duffy leased a car for personal use.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we went back to Keyes, he said Duffy&rsquo;s office hadn&rsquo;t replied to a request for comment before his article was published. After it was published, Keyes attached to the article a Duffy <a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=274880\">news </a><a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=274880\">release</a> refuting what the article said about Duffy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKeyes also told us in an email:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I take Duffy at his word on the matter and wish his staff had been more forthright on the matter initially. The larger point of hypocrisy remains, though. If he&#39;s going to use budget deficits to justify taking food stamps away from poor people, he should at a minimum be willing to lead by example in eschewing his own office expenses (like many of his GOP colleagues who represent much larger districts have done).&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKeyes accused Duffy of using tax money for a car for personal use, saying he is among seven &quot;Tea Party freshmen&quot; who &quot;spent an average of $15,000 on cars for themselves.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Duffy leases a bus that is used as a &quot;mobile office,&quot; not a car for himself.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat makes the claim about Duffy false and ridiculous and leaves Keyes at this destination: Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-24T17:04:38.263502", "ruling_date": "2012-07-27T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "GOP Wisconsin U.S. Rep.
