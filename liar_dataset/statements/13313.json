Question is -- why are both of you ignoring this problem?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said the basis of the question was wrong because he will &quot;create tremendous jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton, meanwhile, said she pays for everything she proposes, primarily by increasing taxes for the wealthiest Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What I have put forward does not add a penny to the debt,&quot; Clinton said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes and no. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan policy group, says Clinton&rsquo;s plans would increase the debt by a relatively small amount, <a href=\"http://crfb.org/papers/promises-and-price-tags-preliminary-update\">$200 billion over a decade &quot;above current law levels.&quot; </a>The Clinton campaign says a new business tax plan would generate an additional <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/10/13/clinton-foresees-275-billion-in-new-business-tax-revenue-but-from-where/\">$275 billion to cancel out that debt increase.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However the numbers shake out, the debt would still grow by $9 trillion over 10 years because of interest payments related to the U.S. debt and projected spending on Social Security and Medicare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Interest on the debt will become the fastest growing part of federal spending. In 2017, the next president will inherit a government projected to spend over $300 billion on interest payments that year alone, an amount that grows to more than $800 billion by 2025 &mdash; more than the current combined federal spending on the Defense Department, education, transportation, and medical research,&quot; wrote <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Bixby-MacGuineas_FINAL.pdf\">Bob Bixby and Maya MacGuineas</a> for the Brookings Institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, as Wallace said, without further changes, debt would rise to above 86 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product under Clinton&rsquo;s plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, Wallace was also correct that the debt would grow faster if Trump is elected, according to independent researchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a chart spelling it out from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/h6F6j9CPGHd7bMGw1C84HHaBYZo55EUiBN_irxudinBmyRl1w3CEXs0dLkRTP5lqCOP2JPd3p8hxDGp4F6rWKHTU8FkY4X0ntHAK5lpOTziE_F-nNr5S7B9C2CudMEF70y8-5B5x\" style=\"border:none; height:295px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are encouraged that Clinton continues to largely pay for her new spending and that Trump has made substantial improvements to his plan, including a less costly tax plan and new spending cuts,&quot; the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Unfortunately, neither candidate has presented a proposal to address our growing national debt and put it on a more sustainable path, nor have they offered a proposal for shoring up the Social Security, Medicare, or Highway trust funds. As it currently stands, Donald Trump&rsquo;s proposals would still substantially worsen the debt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;What I have put forward does not add a penny to the debt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An independent analysis found Clinton&rsquo;s proposals would add a relatively small amount to the debt, $200 billion over a decade. The Clinton campaign says a new business tax plan will address that, though the proposal hasn&rsquo;t been independently analyzed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless, Clinton&rsquo;s explanation leaves out the fact that debt would still rise by about $9 trillion over 10 years because of current policies. Clinton&rsquo;s proposals don&rsquo;t stem that increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.
