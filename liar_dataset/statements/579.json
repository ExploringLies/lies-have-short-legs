Before that, the last time Obama had been in Iraq was in January 2006. McCain, on the other hand, has been to Iraq eight times as of this writing. The McCain-Obama Iraq tally is now 8 to 2.\n</p>\n<p>\n One catch to this claim is that it was accurate when the ad was released on Friday, but was no longer accurate by Monday, July 21.
