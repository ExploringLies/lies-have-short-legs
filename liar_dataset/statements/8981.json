For a family of four in every state but Alaska and Hawaii, that poverty level was $22,350 in 2011 and $23,050 in 2012, according to the note.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This information also can be sorted by the number of women in poverty in each state. By this metric, Texas--with nearly 1.8 million women in poverty--trailed only California, with 2.7 million women in poverty (see below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/stXUJkZzrQOOtf2ifMuxlVNp8GCxKIgiFC2dA61gAqej1C8IVT6h_lCXUHBthB0q5Vj4-LmyuTvb-HwV2LxVq6ODcpCnbdOP0wf2wGKqTFKJwPpaIHQ0TUBVWw\" style=\"height:355px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source: Web page, <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/adult-poverty-rate-by-gender/\"><u>&quot;Adult Poverty Rate by Gender,&quot;</u></a> State Health Facts, the Henry J.

Fourteen states had more women in poverty: Mississippi, Louisiana, New Mexico, Arkansas, Kentucky, Alabama, West Virginia, Arizona, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina, Oregon and Michigan, according to the chart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But rounding these percentages leaves Texas tied for fifth--with Ohio, Montana, Florida and Oklahoma--with 18 percent of women in poverty, the chart indicates. Mississippi, ranked No. 1, was alone with 25 percent of women in poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In raw numbers, California led the nation with 2 million women in poverty, according to the chart, followed by Texas (1.4 million) and Florida and New York (1 million each).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lee said: &quot;Poverty is consistently higher for females than for men across the country. There are a lot of causes of this, but one is that many women work in historically underpaid jobs. &nbsp;Women who must raise children alone are especially vulnerable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scherr said more women live in poverty in Texas than almost anywhere else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In raw numbers, California in 2012 had the most women in poverty followed by Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But poverty rate is a more reasonable yardstick to compare states. The rounded Texas rate--indicating about 18 percent of its women aged 18-64 lived in poverty in 2012--tied the state for fifth with some other states. Breaking out each state&#39;s rate to tenths of percentage points, though, shows 14 states with a greater share of women in poverty than Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim, which could have been more precise, as Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY TRUE </em></strong><em>&ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"> <u>more</u></a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-02-27T17:58:43.260478", "ruling_date": "2014-02-27T17:11:32", "ruling_headline": "Texas among top slice of states with women in poverty, though 14 states had a greater estimated share of women in poverty in 2012", "ruling_headline_slug": "texas-among-top-slice-states-women-poverty-though-", "ruling_link_text": "Nearly one in five Texas women", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Web page, <a href=\"http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/adult-poverty-rate-by-gender/\"><u>&quot;Adult Poverty Rate by Gender,&quot;</u></a> State Health Facts, the Henry J.
