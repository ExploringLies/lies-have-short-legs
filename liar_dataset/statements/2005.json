We wanted details.</p>\r\n<p>Barton subsequently  told us in an e-mail: &quot;I knew several of the key Democrats who put it  together (including the head of the union based in Houston who was a  principal in the event) and I also heard about it from influential  business leaders who were invited to the event by Garcia and Lanier.&quot; He  said guests were summoned by phone or e-mail.</p>\r\n<p>Straus&rsquo;s spokeswoman,  Tracy Young, confirmed that Straus raised money for his campaign at a  May 4, 2010 party held at the Laniers&rsquo; Houston home. Young said, though,  the event was hosted by Harris County&rsquo;s entire House delegation&mdash;not  just Democrats. Also, she said, Garcia, the county commissioner, did not  attend.</p>\r\n<p>We reached Garcia, who  said she was invited to the party, but couldn&rsquo;t attend -- nor did she  call or e-mail anyone to invite them. Barton&rsquo;s suggestion that she did  so, Garcia said, &quot;is just not true.&quot; Asked if she&rsquo;s a Straus supporter,  Garcia replied: &quot;Not really ... The only campaign I am worried about is  the Sylvia Garcia re-election campaign.&quot;<br /> <br />By e-mail, Young  forwarded a document inviting recipients to the &quot;Bayou Tribute to  Speaker Joe Straus.&quot; Under &quot;Honorary Host Committee&quot; it lists 29  Houston-area House members, 17 Republicans and 12 Democrats.</p>\r\n<p>Young also shared a  document titled &quot;Host Committee&quot; listing more than 30 sponsors of the  event including Bob Perry and tort-reform advocate Dick Weekley, Houston  homebuilders and major GOP donors; super-lobbyist Mike Toomey of  Austin; beer distributor and donor John Nau of Houston and political  action committees for law firms, pilots and oil and energy-related  firms. The listed sponsors include a PAC for the United Transportation  Union.</p>\r\n<p>The Laniers are among  eight identified underwriters of the party. While mayor of Houston, Bob  Lanier was viewed as a Democrat, though the office is filled via  non-partisan elections. The May event at the Lanier&rsquo;s home, Young said,  &quot;wasn't a Democrat(ic) fundraiser - it was a bipartisan fundraiser.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>How does all this add  up?</p>\r\n<p>Without a subpoena, we  can&rsquo;t determine whether Garcia invited others to the fundraiser, though  it appears she did not attend. </p>\r\n<p>The rest of Barton&rsquo;s statement is notable for  what it leaves out. For instance, it&rsquo;s fair to say the Laniers  sponsored the party. But so did more than two dozen other backers,  including GOP benefactors. While &quot;numerous&quot; Democratic officials were  listed as honorary hosts, so were many Republican officeholders.</p>\r\n<p>As for &quot;high-ranking  union officials,\" we identified one union&rsquo;s role. On the other side of  the political spectrum Barton did not mention hosts such as Anadarko  Petroleum PAC. That committee&rsquo;s parent company is a partner BP oil well  that blew in the Gulf of Mexico. It&rsquo;s also the biggest single corporate  donor to Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, according to the Center for  Responsive Politics.</p>\r\n<p>We weren&rsquo;t given a list of guests so we could  not assess their partisan affiliations. At the least, the Straus event  does not appear to have been planned as the Democratic fundraiser Barton  portrays. To the contrary, it may have underscored a reality of Texas  politics: It behooves players of all stripes to make merry with the  speaker.</p>\r\n<p>We rate Barton&rsquo;s sally  Barely True.</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
