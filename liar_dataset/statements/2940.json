And &quot;Why?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause of AMC&#39;s hit series &quot;The Walking Dead.&quot; Flesh-eating zombies take over Atlanta, and in Sunday&#39;s season finale, survivors who take refuge at the CDC find out things are even worse than they thought: The building is locked down and rigged to explode.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen the CDC&#39;s generators run out of fuel, a two-stage device more powerful than anything known to mankind short of a nuclear bomb will blow it to kingdom come.<br style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\" />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It sets the air on fire,&quot; fictional CDC scientist Dr. Edwin Jenner said. &quot;No pain.

PolitiFact Georgia readers and more than a few Atlanta Journal-Constitution staffers asked PolitiFact to check whether the CDC has an endgame plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The Walking Dead&quot; follows survivors of a plague that turns people into zombies. In the show&#39;s post-apocalypse Atlanta, the undead lurch down Marietta Street and through the countryside hungry for human innards.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre stands in as the CDC&#39;s stunt double.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The Walking Dead&quot; is by far the most popular show shot in Atlanta, according to ajc.com&#39;s Radio &amp; TV Talk blog. It averaged 5 million viewers during the fall season, which is 2 million more than second-place Bravo&#39;s &quot;The Real Housewives of Atlanta.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis makes it the most popular drama in basic-cable history among the coveted 18- to 49-year-old demographic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd when a show this popular turns a major DeKalb County employer into a smoldering pit of rubble, AJC PolitiFact Georgia readers take notice.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called the CDC. Officials there said the agency was not consulted during production of the show.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile the agency does have safeguards in case generators fail, a subnuclear blast is not one of them, <font><font>spokeswoman Karen Hunter</font><font><font><font> said. </font></font></font></font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We do have systems in place, but none of them involve explosives,&quot; Hunter said.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe CDC has safeguards for a variety of emergencies, but they don&#39;t specifically address the possibility of the end of humanity.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We do not have a doomsday scenario at the CDC,&quot; Hunter said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf for some reason the CDC were unable to operate from its main campus, designated employees would travel to another location and work from there, Hunter said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBackup generators have failed at least twice in recent years. In June 2007, lightning knocked out power at the CDC&#39;s $214 million infectious disease building -- including the agency&#39;s six high-tech labs designed to contain Ebola, smallpox, avian influenza and other killer bugs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn July 2008, a bird shorted out a Georgia Power transformer, cutting off power to part of the CDC&#39;s main campus.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCritics worried the generator failures showed the lab was unsafe. The Government Accountability Office investigated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile &quot;The Walking Dead&#39;s&quot; CDC seemed to use fire as a kind of disinfectant, the real CDC typically uses other cleaning methods.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the second-to-last episode, Jenner accidentally spills a caustic chemical as he works in a lab, which automatically decontaminates by setting itself on fire.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn reality, CDC scientists disinfect spills with some very uncinematic household products, said Tom Skinner, another CDC spokesman.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Lysol and bleach,&quot; Skinner said. Materials used to clean the spill are burned, but not by a self-immolating lab. They use incinerators.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScientists work with dangerous pathogens in rooms with negative airflow to prevent germs from leaking outside. Air entering and leaving those rooms is scrubbed with filters. Scientists wear protective suits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile we are disappointed to find that real life is not nearly as cinematic as fiction, we walk away from our effort heartened.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe are pleased to reassure the CDC&#39;s neighbors that they do not need to install flame-proof siding. The CDC said none of its emergency plans involve blowing up its campus.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlus, the AJC reported two cases in which the CDC emergency generator failures did not coincide with subnuclear explosions.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rule &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; claim Pants On Fire.
