Rep. Dennis Kucinich opened it with a call to question the cost of wars.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We can have a strong defense, but we are spending so much money that we are undermining our ability to be able to provide for the American people here at home,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;One of the biggest causes of our soaring debt and economic insecurity ends up being Pentagon spending. The budget for the Pentagon consumes more than half of our discretionary spending.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio wondered about that and took a closer look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe turned to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and to the National Priorities Project, a nonpartisan, liberal-leaning think tank that analyzes data to show how tax dollars are spent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe federal budget has two types of spending, discretionary and mandatory.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandatory spending, also called direct spending, refers to outlays required by law. It includes such entitlement programs as Social Security and Medicare, veterans&#39; benefits, food stamps, education and health programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandatory spending is about two-thirds of the total budget. The problem of dealing with the politically charged entitlements is why balancing the budget is so difficult.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDiscretionary spending is the part of the budget governed by the annual appropriation process and debated by Congress. That category includes &quot;defense&quot; (which does not include all military-related spending), security, agricultural subsidies, education, health programs, highway construction and housing assistance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDiscretionary defense outlays in fiscal 2010, which ended in October, were $689 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNon-defense outlays were $677 billion, or less than half the total.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor fiscal 2011, the CBO projects an even larger percentage of the discretionary budget -- 58 percent -- is military.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDiscretionary spending on the military has been trending up for more than a decade. From 2001 to 2010, it increased by 71 percent -- almost three times the rate of increase in domestic discretionary spending, which rose about 24 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNonsecurity-related discretionary spending accounts for only about 15 percent of the $3.5 trillion total budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe leave the question of whether that&rsquo;s good policy for others to debate. But as to Kucinich&rsquo;s statement, we rate his claim as True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-17T14:59:17.832981", "ruling_date": "2011-02-18T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
