So we asked the Hillary Clinton campaign where Kaine got the information for that statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sarah Peck, the Virginia director of communications for the Clinton campaign, pointed us to news articles and other sources about Nixon&rsquo;s tax disclosures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also looked at the website for the Presidential Tax History Project, which is run by Tax Analysts, a Falls Church-based nonprofit that specializes in tax issues. That group has <a href=\"http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/web/presidentialtaxreturns\">compiled</a> tax returns online for past presidents and major-party presidential nominees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the group&rsquo;s website, you&rsquo;ll find copies of Nixon&rsquo;s tax returns from 1969 through 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s a catch. Those returns were not released while Nixon was running for president. They were released in December 1973, a year after he was re-elected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, the 37th president was embroiled in the Watergate scandal, and questions were being raised about whether something also was amiss with his tax filings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports had surfaced that Nixon had been paying a small amount of federal tax for several years, a function of having secured a large deduction for donating his vice presidential papers to the National Archives, said Joseph J. Thorndike, a historian at Tax Analysts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To quell lingering concerns, Nixon released tax returns to the public as well as to the Joint Committee on Taxation despite the&nbsp;fact that the president was under an IRS audit at the time, Thorndike told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Nixon did indeed release his full tax returns as president. Did he ever do that while he was running for that office? Nixon ran for president three times, so let&rsquo;s go back a bit further in history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peck pointed us to a 1984 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/25/us/ferraro-s-disclosures-outdo-many-past-candidates-but-not-in-all-respects.html\">story</a> in The New York Times, which noted that in his successful 1968 campaign for the presidency, Nixon released a brief summary of his financial affairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1968 nominating contest, Nixon faced a field of GOP candidates that included Michigan Gov. George Romney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Romney, whose son Mitt was the GOP presidential nominee in 2012, released a dozen years of his tax returns to Look magazine, according to a Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-08-02/nixon-s-failed-effort-to-withhold-his-tax-returns\">column</a> written by Stephen Mihm, an associate professor of history at the University of Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Look (magazine) then went to Nixon, who proved distinctly less forthcoming. He permitted a writer to inspect photocopies of his returns, but only three years&rsquo; worth,&quot; Mihm wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The history professor added that the issue didn&rsquo;t come up during the general election campaign, because Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey also refused to release his tax returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mihm told us that Look magazine merely summarized selected information from Nixon&rsquo;s returns, rather than publishing the documents themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I suppose one could argue that Nixon gave a journalist access to his returns, but that&rsquo;s not the same thing as releasing them,&quot; Mihm wrote in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thorndike also told us that Nixon&rsquo;s limited disclosure in that instance wouldn&rsquo;t really count as the candidate releasing his tax returns to the public. A reporter was able to look at them but wasn&rsquo;t allowed to keep a copy of them, Thorndike noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In my book, that would not count as releasing your tax returns, because the whole crowd source thing is a big part of it,&quot; Thorndike said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find any record of Nixon releasing tax returns during his two other runs for the presidency - in 1960, against John F. Kennedy, or in his 1972 re-election bid against George McGovern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thorndike said that, to his knowledge, Nixon didn&rsquo;t release his returns during those campaigns. Mihm also told us he&rsquo;s not aware of Nixon releasing his tax returns during any of his presidential campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Thorndike said Nixon&rsquo;s presidential tax return disclosure, while he was president in 1973, did start a tradition where presidents and candidates seeking the highest office release their returns to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nixon&rsquo;s successor, Gerald Ford, did not release his tax returns publicly but instead provided a summary of his taxes. But Jimmy Carter did publicly release his tax returns while running against Ford in 1976. In fact, every major-party nominee since Carter has released them to the public, Thorndike said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaine said, &quot;Even Richard Nixon released his tax returns to the public when he was running for president ...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nixon never released his tax returns during a presidential campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is a kernel of truth in Kaine&rsquo;s statement. Nixon released his full returns when he already was president, to quell controversy over his taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also while running in 1968, he allowed a reporter to examine his returns, but beyond that limited circumstance, there&rsquo;s no record that Nixon opened his tax forms to the general public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Kaine&rsquo;s statement has an element of truth, it ignores facts that would create a different impression. We rate his statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e5913d6f-75bb-4d4e-bb5b-c112a9635685\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e5913d6f-75bb-4d4e-bb5b-c112a9635685</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-22T10:26:07.672393", "ruling_date": "2016-08-22T10:18:49", "ruling_headline": "Tim Kaine wrongly says Richard Nixon released tax returns during campaign", "ruling_headline_slug": "tim-kaine-wrongly-says-richard-nixon-released-tax-", "ruling_link_text": "Nixon released tax returns while president, not on campaign trail", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2GvOVeQxEQ\">&quot;Full speech: Tim Kaine economic plan speech in Manchester, New Hampshire,&quot;</a> Aug. 13, 2016.
