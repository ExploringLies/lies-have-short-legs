Scott Walker&rsquo;s 2011 changes to curtail collective bargaining for most public employees, teachers and many other public workers are now paying more for pensions and health care.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut a chain email making the rounds alleges that Walker quietly -- and drastically -- cut salaries even more for the best-educated teachers in April 2012 with the stroke of a pen that changed an administrative rule.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim made the rounds after a highly confusing episode in which Walker reshaped a rule, thereby lowering by some 30 percent the inflation-based raises that public unions can negotiate under Act 10, which included Walker&rsquo;s limits on unions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe rule change would not use an individual&#39;s actual salary as a &quot;base salary&quot; to calculate raises and would exclude factors such as whether a teacher has a graduate degree, the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/new-state-rule-would-limit-costofliving-increases-for-unions-8153h46-148330765.html\">Journal Sentinel</a> reported on April 20, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDays later, the chain<a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/salaryemail.pdf\"> </a><a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/salaryemail.docx.doc\">email</a> began -- subject line: Scott Walker and Max teacher Pay -- making the rounds. It echoed <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLskJOkuAQM&amp;feature=player_embedded\">allegations by a top labor leader</a>, Marty Beil, that Walker&rsquo;s rule went even further -- actually drastically cutting the base salaries in question.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReaders asked us to get to the bottom of the email, which began:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I have some heart-stopping news that I believe has devastating<br />\r\n\tconsequences for all active and retired public employees.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe email said the rule would prohibit school districts from including add-on pay for advanced degrees in the wage scales written into any of its labor contracts. It claimed teachers would be hit the hardest, even providing an example -- Sarah Teacher.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Let&rsquo;s say Sarah Teacher has a Masters degree, 24 hours of college credit and 12 years experience. The most Sarah can be paid under her current contract is $52,927.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Under the new rule, the maximum Sarah will be able to earn in future contracts is $38,167, the maximum for a teacher who has the minimum educational requirements but many years of experience.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe email claimed Sarah Teacher&#39;s salary will be &quot;slashed by a third&quot; -- perhaps even more as cash-strapped districts squeeze staff even tighter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s really going on?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s union legislation blocks school districts from including educational add-on pay in labor contracts. So it wasn&rsquo;t the more recent rule change that did that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition, there is no dispute the rule change limits the size of the pool for wage increases that school districts and unions will negotiate over.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, in this item, we&rsquo;ll focus on the heart of the email&rsquo;s claim -- that Walker&rsquo;s action mandated big pay cuts for teachers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe talked to lawyers with the employment relations commission, which approved Walker&rsquo;s modification of the rule. We also consulted with a labor lawyer and examined statements by labor officials.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey all agreed: The rule does not cut the current wages of teachers -- or require or direct that to happen.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe power to set salaries lies with local school districts, not Walker or the employment relations commission.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome argue the rule makes it much easier for local districts to make big cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis comes down to where the starting point is set for public employees. Act 10 prohibited bargaining over pay schedules -- those grids that award teachers additional pay based on higher education and seniority. It left intact bargaining over inflationary increases to base wages -- the salary level not including educational bonuses and other add-ons.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first version of the rule -- before Walker&rsquo;s changes -- made clear that a teacher&rsquo;s current total salary would be the starting point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s changes in the rule put that in doubt, with experts disagreeing on how this will play out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome say the new rule makes it easier for school officials to cut into existing salaries without any collective bargaining.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut they say districts also will be free -- outside of narrow labor talks on inflationary raises -- to give teachers additional pay for higher education outside any labor contract. That could make teachers &quot;whole&quot; if districts chose on their own, outside of labor talks, to honor previous pay for higher education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe other camp says the new rule does not mean current salaries can be ignored when unions sit down with management to discuss wages.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEventually, the employment relations commission or a court will likely have to settle that issue, which also affects technical college teachers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur conclusion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA chain email says an administrative rule modified by Gov. Scott Walker amounted to him slashing teacher salaries.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe can&rsquo;t predict the future, so there is no way to know how individual districts will approach teacher pay in the years ahead under this rule and Act 10.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it&rsquo;s clear that the rule Walker reshaped does not give him authority over base pay, and does not mandate pay cuts for teachers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate that claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-10T18:59:08.165595", "ruling_date": "2012-05-13T13:40:00", "ruling_headline": "Email says rule change by Gov.
