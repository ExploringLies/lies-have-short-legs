Gov. David Dewhurst and state Sen. Dan Patrick, who will meet in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the Republican Party&rsquo;s lieutenant governor nomination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toward the end of their quarrelsome give-and-take joust, hosted May 7, 2014, by WFAA-TV in Dallas, Patrick blamed Dewhurst for igniting Davis&rsquo; gubernatorial bid with his oversight of the Texas Senate in the summer 2013 special legislative session in which Davis, a Democratic senator from Fort Worth, filibustered GOP-sought abortion restrictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dewhurst scoffed, saying that Republican Greg Abbott, the state attorney general, is winning the governor&rsquo;s fray.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And Wendy Davis&rsquo;s star is falling, not rising,&quot; Dewhurst said. &quot;She was just doing a fund-raiser in Chicago with the international socialists organization.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was? We put that claim to the Texas Truth-O-Meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Dewhurst&rsquo;s campaign spokeswoman, Eliza Vielma, for the basis of Dewhurst&rsquo;s claim, and, by email, she pointed to May 6, 2014, Abbott campaign<a href=\"http://linkis.com/www.defeatdavis.com/fR9hc\"> <u>press release</u></a>. The Abbott release quoted a <em>Chicago Sun-Times </em><a href=\"http://politics.suntimes.com/article/chicago/schakowsky-fundraiser-features-lizz-winstead-wendy-davis-quinn/mon-05052014-719am\"><u>news blog post</u></a> previewing Davis as a featured guest at a May 5, 2014, Chicago fund-raiser for U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbott&rsquo;s release also cited an Oct. 16, 2010, <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/249999/jan-schakowsky-and-socialism-stanley-kurtz\"><u>post</u></a> on &quot;The Corner,&quot; a National Review Online blog that<a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/taxonomy/term/22/about\"> <u>describes itself</u></a> as a &quot;web-leading source of real-time conservative opinion.&quot; The 2010 post, by<a href=\"http://www.eppc.org/fellows-scholars/stanley-kurtz/\"> <u>Stanley Kurtz</u></a>, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Ethics &amp; Public Policy Center, said that while researching his book, &quot;Radical-in-Chief: Barack Obama and the Untold Story of American Socialism,&quot; he came across &quot;documentary evidence&quot; that Schakowsky was a member of the <a href=\"http://www.dsausa.org/\"><u>Democratic Socialists of America</u></a> at the start of her political career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kurtz closed his post by saying the &quot;idea of socialist politicians working openly or quietly within the Democratic Party is not a wild impossibility but a real phenomenon.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No documents were included in the post to back up Kurtz&rsquo;s claim that Schakowsky was a member of the socialist group. So we followed up with him. By email, Kurtz said Schakowsky was an &quot;active member&quot; of Chicago&rsquo;s DSA chapter in the 1980s, a conclusion he said he based on chapter newsletters from 1983 and 1986 that he said he viewed in archives at New York University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I do not know how long&quot; Schakowsky &quot;remained a member of the DSA,&quot; Kurtz wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we published this fact check, Kurtz told us by email, he sent Breitbart Texas <a href=\"http://www.docstoc.com/docs/169691404/Schakowsky-DSApdf\"><u>copies of the relevant newsletter pages</u></a>. Schakowsky is credited as the author of an article in the February/March 1983 issue of the Chicago Socialist, published by the Chicago chapter. Her article recapped a Joliet meeting of the Illinois Public Action Council, a mix of progressive groups. A June 1986 newsletter item, headlined &quot;DSAers on the move,&quot; included a sentence stating that on the local political scene, a DSAer had been hired by the chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party while Schakowsky&rsquo;s bid &quot;for Cook County Board got a boost when she drew 2nd ballot position among 14 candidates.&quot; The <a href=\"http://www.cookcountygov.com/portal/server.pt/community/government/226/leadership/314\"><u>Cook County Board of Commissioners</u></a> is the county&rsquo;s legislative body. Also by email, Bob Roman, secretary of the Chicago DSA chapter, told us the posted excerpts were authentic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schakowsky&rsquo;s House spokesman, Lee Whack, referred us to her campaign political director, Alex Armour, who didn&rsquo;t engage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By telephone, Maria Svart, the national director of the DSA, noted the group is an activist and educational group and not a political party. She also reaffirmed what a predecessor in that role, Frank Llewellyn,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/sep/05/blog-posting/bloggers-say-two-texas-democrats-among-socialists-/\"> <u>told PolitiFact in 2011</u></a>. To join the group, a person must fill out a form and pay dues, Llewellyn said, adding that the last member of Congress who was a card-carrying member was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Svart also said that while the group doesn&rsquo;t announce its members, as far as she knows, Schakowsky isn&rsquo;t a member and never was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, we spotted a web post by the Chicago chapter of the DSA showing Schakowsky spoke at the group&rsquo;s May 13, 2011, Eugene V. Debs-Norman Thomas-Michael Harrington<a href=\"http://www.chicagodsa.org/d2011/book2011.pdf\"> <u>dinner</u></a> celebrating union organizers and other activists on the left.<a href=\"http://www.chicagodsa.org/ngarchive/ng136.html\"> <u>A May-June 2011 DSA recap</u></a> said Schakowsky told guests that despite Democrats being the House minority, she was optimistic in that conservatives in Congress had over-reached. A DSA<a href=\"http://www.chicagodsa.org/dthdin.html\"> <u>web page</u></a> on the history of the annual dinner lists Schakowsky as the 2000 dinner&rsquo;s honoree. That listing led to another<a href=\"http://www.chicagodsa.org/d2000.html#anchor1228681\"> <u>web post</u></a> detailing why Schakowsky was honored, touching on her actions as a consumer advocate and state and federal legislator. It didn&rsquo;t speak to her membership (or not) in the DSA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, Roman said Schakowsky is &quot;not somebody that we claim as a member.&quot; He also said he generally doesn&rsquo;t comment on whether anyone is current or former member. &quot;Once you say &lsquo;so and so&rsquo; is a member, was a member or was never a member, then you open yourself to queries about any single person who has ever been a member,&quot; Roman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To our inquiry, Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas (fairly new to Texas) said of Dewhurst&rsquo;s statement: &quot;That&rsquo;s potentially the most absurd claim I&rsquo;ve ever heard.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Petkanas emailed us a copy of<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGcU5LbGlNQWJEcXM/edit?usp=sharing\"> <u>the invitation</u></a> to the Schakowsky event attended by Davis. The invitation &nbsp;lacks mention of Davis--and lists Winstead as the star attraction. Petkanas also provided what he described as the prepared text of<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGQVlTNnhkenNJY00/edit?usp=sharing\"> <u>Davis&rsquo; remarks</u></a> at the event, which do not include an appeal for donations to Schakowsky&rsquo;s political kitty. &quot;Davis stopped by the event to talk about Texas and give an update on her campaign,&quot; Petkanas said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dewhurst said Davis raised money in Chicago for a socialist organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Davis appeared at a fund-raiser for a Democratic U.S. House member who may have participated in DSA chapter meetings in the 1980s. There&rsquo;s no sign Schakowsky is a current DSA member, nor is there evidence Davis raised money for a socialist group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This claim shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous.
