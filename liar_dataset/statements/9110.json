Yet Burke cites it as an authoritative document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the mover&#39;s 2012 study, Wisconsin was among 10 states labeled &quot;high outbound&quot; -- meaning, 55 percent or more of the moves handled by United Van Lines in Wisconsin were for people leaving Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in the 2013 <a href=\"http://www.unitedvanlines.com/mover/united-newsroom/press-releases/2014/2013-united-van-lines-migration-study.htm\"><u>study</u></a>, released nearly three months before Burke issued her jobs report, only nine states were labeled high outbound and Wisconsin was not one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin was among 31 states labeled as &quot;balanced&quot; --<strong> </strong>that is, the difference between the number of United Van Lines customers moving into and out of Wisconsin was negligible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Burke cites outdated data from a source that is not comprehensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But outmigration is something that is tracked by the U.S. Census Bureau.

In one census estimate, Wisconsin ranked 10th in terms of a net loss of residents from state-to-state migration from roughly 2010 to 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the latest one-year census estimate shows Wisconsin ranked 12th in raw numbers, 15th on a percentage basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, a one-year measure based on a census survey indicates Wisconsin actually gained more residents than it lost through people moving from one state to another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that Burke&rsquo;s claim emphasized where Wisconsin ranks now, it goes too far.
