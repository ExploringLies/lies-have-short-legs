Joe Barton, R-Texas, said people visiting <a href=\"http://healthcare.gov\">healthcare.gov</a> are unwittingly waiving their privacy rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barton told&nbsp;<a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/2768818095001/monkey-court-rep-joe-barton-defends-obamacare-hearings/\"><u>Fox News</u></a> that there&#39;s a problem in the source code that seems to contradict HIPAA, the 1996 law that, among other things, protects the privacy of patients&rsquo; sensitive data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hidden in the code, there is a sentence that says you waive any reasonable right to privacy of your personal information, the transiting of it or the storage of it,&quot; Barton said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to take a peek under healthcare.gov&rsquo;s hood to see if Barton, the chairman emeritus of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, was right that people are waiving their privacy rights if they use the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The source code</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barton&rsquo;s spokesman sent us the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/10/Barton-page-copy.pdf&amp;chrome=true\"><u>code</u></a> he referenced during the hearing. It&rsquo;s the same code the <em>Washington Post</em> published with their own <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/24/the-biggest-fight-at-the-obamacare-hearing-was-over-these-47-lines-of-code/\"><u>analysis</u></a>. This is the website&rsquo;s HTML markup, which is the main language developers use to write websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The line in question reads, &quot;You have no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of important HTML symbols around that section of the code, on lines 1406 and 1411. The section starts with a &lt;!-- and ends with --&gt;. That means all the content in between is &quot;commented out,&quot; a web development term that tells everything enclosed to not display on the user&rsquo;s screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clay Johnson, the founder of the company that built President Barack Obama&rsquo;s 2008 online campaign, said it&rsquo;s a common technique for developers who want to delete something from a site&rsquo;s appearance without permanently losing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The text is also a standard disclaimer for government websites, as an advanced <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%22you+have+no+reasonable+expectation+of+privacy+regarding+any+communication+or+data+transiting%22+site:.gov&amp;lr=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=1324&amp;ei=N7RuUv-nO8mGkQf794CgAQ&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N&amp;filter=0\"><u>Google search</u></a> Johnson ran pointed out. It could&rsquo;ve been easily copied by a developer as placeholder text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spokeswoman Linda Odorisio of CGI Federal, one of the main government contractors that built the site and was responsible for that portion of code, told us that line wasn&rsquo;t meant to be in the code at all. Rather, it was meant for exchange employees who have access to consumer data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It informs them that their interaction with data in the system is monitored and tracked to ensure consumer privacy,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Consumer privacy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barton pulled up the code at the hearing as a way of backing up his claim that healthcare.gov isn&rsquo;t compliant with HIPAA regulations on privacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parts of Obama&rsquo;s law must be compliant with <a href=\"http://www.hrsa.gov/healthit/toolbox/HealthITAdoptiontoolbox/PrivacyandSecurity/entityhipaa.html\"><u>HIPAA</u></a>, but not the website itself, since HIPAA covers health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean the site doesn&rsquo;t have privacy regulations in place, as we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/09/tom-cotton/aca-marketplaces-have-no-privacy-protections-cotto/\"><u>noted before</u></a>. The Affordable Care Act <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ148/pdf/PLAW-111publ148.pdf\"><u>outlines</u></a> processes for ensuring privacy and complying with existing privacy regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the &quot;hidden&quot; code, users can&rsquo;t legally accept a waiver they can&rsquo;t see, so they can&rsquo;t possibly be waiving their right to privacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department of Health and Human Services, the agency that oversees the marketplace, referred us to the site&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/privacy/\"><u>privacy policy</u></a>, which addresses what officials can and can&rsquo;t do with your sensitive information. They can use what you input only to confirm your eligibility to buy a marketplace premium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, the lines inserted in the code may be embarrassing, but they carry no legal weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s bizarre and kind of sad to see that that would even be put in there as a comment note because that doesn&rsquo;t accurately represent the privacy protections in place,&quot; said Christopher Rasmussen, a Health Privacy Project senior policy analyst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barton claimed healthcare.gov has &quot;hidden&quot; code indicating that consumers waive their rights to privacy when they apply for insurance. The website&rsquo;s markup does include a sentence along these lines that isn&rsquo;t visible to the user. But because it&rsquo;s not displayed to the public, it carries no legal weight and consumers can&rsquo;t consent to it. Bottom line, it doesn&rsquo;t change a thing about the privacy protections in place at healthcare.gov. We rate Barton&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-10-29T17:03:28.638403", "ruling_date": "2013-10-29T17:50:38", "ruling_headline": "Healthcare.gov users 'waive any reasonable right to privacy,' Rep.
