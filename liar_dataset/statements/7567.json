Carlos Trujillo, R-Miami, says he doesn&rsquo;t know why his &quot;parent trigger&quot; bill is creating a partisan fight in the Capitol.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes, it&rsquo;s supported by former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, but it&rsquo;s also popular with supporters of President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton, he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;This legislation was drafted by President Obama&#39;s top advisers. It was drafted by President Clinton&rsquo;s top advisers,&quot; he said on March 18, 2013, during the House Education Committee hearing on his bill. &quot;Gov. Bush is a big supporter of this, so it&rsquo;s not a partisan issue. I&rsquo;m not sure why it&rsquo;s turned into that.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe wondered if Trujillo was right about the roots of the parent trigger bill. Did state Democrats miss the bipartisanship memo? The bill in question is <a href=\"http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=50114\">HB 867</a>, &quot;Parent Empowerment in Education.&quot; The law allows parents at failing schools to demand changes, including asking for public schools to be turned into charter schools.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOpponents say this power already exists under state and federal law, and teachers unions don&rsquo;t like that public schools could be turned into charter schools. Supporters, like Bush&rsquo;s Foundation for Florida&rsquo;s Future, said it gives parents at those schools a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/jeb-bushs-education-foundation-debunks-myths-about-contentious/2111273\">legal seat at the table</a>&quot; in turning around a school.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCalifornia became the first state with a parent trigger law in 2010, and states including Texas and Indiana have followed in its footsteps. The nonprofit group <a href=\"http://parentrevolution.org/content/model-legislation\">Parent Revolution</a> launched the California initiative and is supporting Trujillo&rsquo;s bill.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAsked to support the claim, Trujillo&rsquo;s legislative aide Alex Miranda pointed us to the executive director of Parent Revolution, Ben Austin. Austin played a role in drafting the original California legislation, which was introduced by California Democratic Sen. Gloria Romero. That legislation was used as a model for Florida.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.parentrevolution.org/our-staff#ben-austin\">Austin&rsquo;s online biography</a> says he has worked on several Democratic presidential campaigns and inside Clinton&rsquo;s White House &quot;in a variety of roles.&quot; Plus, he was &quot;an early supporter of Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidential campaign,&quot; the website states.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe asked Parent Revolution for more details about Austin&rsquo;s working relationship with the presidents, as well as seven other <a href=\"http://www.parentrevolution.org/content/board-directors\">board members </a>and <a href=\"http://www.parentrevolution.org/our-staff\">staffers</a> whose bios included Obama or Clinton ties.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tParent Revolution spokesman David Phelps told us the group designed California&rsquo;s legislation to help that state qualify for a grant under Obama&rsquo;s Race to the Top initiative. But he also said &quot;the usual political definition of &lsquo;top adviser&rsquo; &quot; would not apply to their board members and staff.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;President Obama has spoken frequently (as has Education Secretary Duncan) about the need for parents to be full partners in the decision-making process around their children&#39;s education,&quot; Phelps said. &quot;Parent trigger and our work at Parent Revolution is a proactive response to those Obama administration calls.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPhelps was not aware of Obama or Clinton publicly endorsing the measure. He also stressed that Florida is not using a carbon copy of California&rsquo;s parent trigger law, as each state &quot;has its own specific priorities and educational needs, and state legislators write bills accordingly.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe caught up with Pat DeTemple, Parent Revolution senior strategist. DeTemple winced a little when we told him Trujillo&rsquo;s statement. &quot;I don&rsquo;t want to speak for Rep. Trujillo,&quot; he said. He touched on Austin&rsquo;s &quot;political&quot; role in Clinton&rsquo;s White House and ticked off a series of Austin&rsquo;s Democratic credentials.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOkay, but does that make him a top adviser to either Clinton or Obama?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;No, no,&quot; DeTemple said. &quot;I was a general election director for Barack, and I was not a top adviser to him either, you know?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStill, Trujillo has a point about the law attracting national Democratic support, even if Florida Democrats aren&rsquo;t into it, DeTemple said. He pointed to Newark Mayor Cory Booker and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa as examples of high-profile Democrats who support the concept, as well as Obama&#39;s former chief of staff, Chicago Mayor <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-04-14/news/ct-met-parent-trigger-20110413_1_charter-schools-pro-charter-group-parents-united\">Rahm Emanuel</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOpponents of the parent trigger movement, such as Orlando parent advocacy group <a href=\"http://www.fundeducationnow.org/resource-room/parent-trigger/\">Fund Education Now</a>, say talking up liberal credentials is an attempt by supporters of parent trigger &quot;to blur political lines and to declare support from Democrats for this conservative free-market effort.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tKathleen Oropeza, co-founder of Fund Education Now, stressed the parent trigger law was picked up as model legislation by the conservative, pro-business advocacy group American Legislative Exchange Council after California&rsquo;s parent trigger law survived a legal challenge.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tShe called Trujillo&rsquo;s Clinton/Obama claim an overreach.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Ben Austin and Mike Trujillo each worked on Obama and Clinton campaigns,&quot; she said. &quot;That does not mean that Obama asked to have the trigger law written, or that he supports it.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn trying to persuade Democrats to support his parent trigger bill, Trujillo said, &quot;This legislation was drafted by President Obama&#39;s top advisers. It was drafted by President Clinton&rsquo;s top advisers.&quot; He makes it sound as if the legislation were written in the West Wing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tParent groups, unions and activists may disagree vehemently on the bill, but they sound in agreement on one thing: The concept was not drafted by &quot;top advisers&quot; to Clinton and Obama. The people who had a hand in creating the legislation would more accurately be described as supporters of Obama and Clinton, not &quot;top advisers.&quot; We rate his statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-26T17:00:00.086670", "ruling_date": "2013-03-27T16:12:47", "ruling_headline": "Carlos Trujillo says 'top advisers' to Bill Clinton and Obama drafted parent trigger bill", "ruling_headline_slug": "carlos-trujillo-says-top-advisers-bill-clinton-and", "ruling_link_text": "West Wing writers?
