So Shkreli took to the airwaves to defend himself, insisting that the price hike was <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/turing-pharmaceuticals-ceo-martin-shkreli-defends-5000-percent-price-hike-on-daraprim-drug/\">altruistic</a> or, at the very least, not unique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You only need less than 100 pills so at the end of the day, the price for treatment &ndash; to save your life &ndash; was only $1,000,&quot; Shkreli <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-09-21/why-turing-increased-price-of-daraprim-over-500-\">told</a> Bloomberg TV on Sept. 21, 2015. &quot;These days, in modern pharmaceuticals, cancer drugs can cost $100,000 or more, rare disease drugs can cost half a million dollars. Daraprim is still underpriced, relative to its peers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daraprim is used to treat a parasitic infection known as toxoplasmosis, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/\" target=\"_blank\">considers</a>&nbsp;a leading cause of death attributed to food-borne illnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;<em>Toxoplasma</em>&nbsp;parasite can be transmitted through contaminated food, &nbsp;water, and kitchen utensils as well as contact with infected cat feces.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>While 60 million Americans carry the&nbsp;parasite with no symptoms, it can become deadly for&nbsp;those with weakened immune systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were curious about Shkreli&rsquo;s claim that Daraprim&rsquo;s new price was comparable to &quot;its peers.&quot; (Shkreli <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/drug-ceo-will-lower-price-daraprim-after-outrage-n431926\">has since said</a> that he would lower the price amid the outrage, but he did not reveal the new price.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither Shkreli nor Turing Pharmaceuticals got back to us for this fact-check, but we found that while other treatments are certainly <a href=\"http://jop.ascopubs.org/content/10/4/e208.full\">expensive</a>, Shkreli is committing a false equivalence when he compares them to Daraprim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shkreli is right that other treatments can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars: for example, the cancer drug Revlimid can cost $150,000 per year while Kalydeco, a drug for cystic fibrosis, can cost $300,000 a year, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/23/business/drug-companies-pushed-from-far-and-wide-to-explain-high-prices.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;gwh=2976780090B7D26946B33797E366620B&amp;gwt=pay&amp;assetType=nyt_now&amp;_r=0\">according to the <em>New York Times</em></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By Shkreli&rsquo;s calculations, the new price of treatment &ndash;100 pills of Daraprim for $750 a pop &ndash; is $75,000. But that&rsquo;s a low estimate, according to the Infectious Disease Societies of America. It <a href=\"http://www.hivma.org/uploadedFiles/HIVMA/HomePageContent/PyrimethamineLetterFINAL.pdf\">estimated</a> a new annual cost of $336,000 to $634,000, depending on dosage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond cancer and rare disease treatments, few drugs cost more than&nbsp;$100,000, said David Howard, a professor of health policy and management at Emory University. So the high price Shkreli cited &quot;isn&rsquo;t a good benchmark for deciding whether a drug is underpriced,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numbers aside, experts told us the real problem with Shkreli&rsquo;s claim is Daraprim and cancer drugs shouldn&rsquo;t be compared to each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They&#39;re not peers,&quot; said Amir Attaran, a professor of health law and policy at the University of Ottawa. &quot;He could have said, &lsquo;A bar of gold cost $1 million, so Daraprim is underpriced.&rsquo; He&#39;s comparing fish and fowl.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply put, cancer and rare disease drugs are almost always under patent, while Daraprim&rsquo;s expired in 1953. And unlike Daraprim, those drugs are the products of expensive, recent research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The comparison is irrelevant. Cancer drugs were developed by companies that invested hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars in research and development,&quot; said John Lamattina, a former senior vice president at pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who currently writes about the industry for <em>Forbes</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daraprim, meanwhile, &quot;is generic drug. There&rsquo;s no research and development they had to do,&quot; said Gerard Anderson, a professor of health economics and finance at Johns Hopkins University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The research and development for Daraprim happened long before Shkreli bought the rights. It&rsquo;s the trade name for <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/pyrimethamine-oral-route/description/drg-20065700\">pyrimethamine</a>, a drug created by Nobel Prize-winning scientist <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/23/us/gertrude-elion-drug-developer-dies-at-81.html\">Gertrude Elion</a> that can be used to treat malaria as well as toxoplasmosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though no generic drug company has taken up manufacturing Daraprim (there are only about 2,000 U.S. patients who use the drug every year), it&rsquo;s been available for reproduction for more than 60 years. That means its peers should be other generic drugs like ibuprofen, penicillin, and antibiotics, experts told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proposed 5,000 percent price increase on Daraprim is indicative of a larger trend among more niche generic drugs. A joint House and Senate investigation, partly led by Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, <a href=\"http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/face-sheet-on-generic-drug-price-increases?inline=file\">found</a> that the annual cost hikes for 10 generic drugs ranged from 390 to 8,200 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This &quot;anarchy pricing&quot; can be attributed to the failure of the free market and a lack of government regulation, says Alan Sager, a professor of health policy and management at Boston University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Essentially, this is an example of where the drug pricing system for generic drugs has totally failed,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;In the past, generic drugs have prices that are low because of competition. Anyone can make it with FDA approval. The only thing you can compete on is price. (Shkreli&rsquo;s) found something where there&#39;s no competitors.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone can legally make Daraprim, but for the time being, Turing&rsquo;s monopoly gives it&nbsp;free reign to impose very high prices. As for Shkreli&rsquo;s claims that the profits will go to research for a better version of Daraprim, experts aren&rsquo;t buying it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Turing has not got a single clinical trial underway. Shkreli&rsquo;s not testing new drugs of any kind for toxoplasmosis. He&#39;s got nothing registered,&quot; Attaran said. &quot;No one needs a new drug for toxoplasmosis anyways. It works so well bloody well.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shkreli, the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, said, &quot;Daraprim is still underpriced, relative to its peers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By his own estimates, Daraprim is cheaper than cancer and rare disease drugs, which he considers Daraprim&rsquo;s &quot;peers.&quot; By others, Daraprim costs about the same, if not more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet experts told us cancer and rare disease drugs are not Daraprim&rsquo;s peers. Daraprim&rsquo;s patent expired more than six decades ago and is a niche generic drug. The same cannot be said of cancer treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check misspelled&nbsp;Martin Shkreli&#39;s name.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-09-24T06:15:51.243016", "ruling_date": "2015-09-24T12:06:01", "ruling_headline": "Fact-checking Martin Shkreli's claim that Daraprim is 'underpriced, relative to its peers'", "ruling_headline_slug": "fact-checking-martin-shkrelis-claim-daraprim-under", "ruling_link_text": "\u201cHe could have said, \u2018A bar of gold cost $1 million, so Daraprim is underpriced' \"", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Bloomberg, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-09-21/why-turing-increased-price-of-daraprim-over-500-\">Drug Goes From $13.50 to $750 Overnight</a>,&quot;
