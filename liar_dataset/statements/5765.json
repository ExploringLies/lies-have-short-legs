Thompson meant to say Middle East when he referred to Saudi Arabia.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, right off the bat, Thompson&rsquo;s claim appears to be wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t2. A 50-cent increase in the price of gas costs U.S. consumers nearly $60 billion per year, according to a March 2012 <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/the-110-effect-what-higher-gas-prices-could-really-do-to-the-economy/254386/\">article</a> in The Atlantic magazine. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Atlantic article did say a 1-cent gas price increase would cost U.S. consumers $1.2 billion per year, which puts something of a time frame on Thompson&rsquo;s statement. But that&rsquo;s a different measure than $1 billion going from the U.S. economy to Saudi Arabia (or the Middle East, for that matter).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted four experts, each of whom used essentially the same math to evaluate Thompson&rsquo;s Saudi Arabia claim. They agreed that a 1-cent increase in the price of a gallon of gas indicates that the price of a barrel of crude oil had risen 42 cents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.jayhakes.com/\">Jay Hakes</a> </strong>is the former director of the U.S. Energy Information Administration under President Bill Clinton and author of A Declaration of Energy Independence. He &nbsp;said that on average, the U.S. imported 1,195,000 barrels of Saudi petroleum per day in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/sec3_10.pdf\">according</a> to the Energy Information Administration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf each barrel cost 42 cents more, the U.S. would pay Saudi Arabia $501,900 more per day -- or slightly more than $183 million per year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means it would take nearly 5 1/2 years for the U.S. to spend $1 billion more on Saudi oil.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>John Kingston </strong>is global director of news for the energy publication <a href=\"http://platts.com/AboutPlattsHome\">Platts</a>. He multiplied 42 cents by a slightly different number -- 1,422,000 -- the net number of barrels per day imported from Saudi Arabia in January 2012, which is the <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_neti_a_EP00_IMN_mbblpd_m.htm\">most recent figure</a> available.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat comes to an additional cost of $597,240 per day, or nearly $218 million per year. So it would take 4-1/2 years to reach $1 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Jim Williams</strong> is an energy economist and owner of <a href=\"http://www.wtrg.com/\">WTRG Economics</a> in Arkansas. He took the same approach Kingston did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/experts/ebingerc.aspx\">Charles Ebinger</a> </strong>is director of the energy security initiative at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C. think tank. He said that for years, many people have claimed that a 1-cent increase in the gasoline tax would cost motorists $1 billion a year. He said that is roughly accurate, depending on how much gas motorists consume in a given year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson didn&rsquo;t mention a gas tax increase in his statement, but let&rsquo;s take a look.<br />\r\n\tEbinger said that if a 1-cent increase in the cost of gas costs motorists $1 billion over one year, about $130 million of that money would go to Saudi Arabia, since about 13 percent of crude oil imports come from that country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt that rate, it would take nearly eight years for Saudi Arabia to collect an additional $1 billion from the United States.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn any case, although Thompson singled it out, Saudi Arabia isn&rsquo;t the largest provider of crude to the United States.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_neti_a_EP00_IMN_mbblpd_m.htm\">latest figures</a> show that in January 2012, net oil imports from Canada were 2.66 million barrels per day, nearly double the 1.42 million barrels from Saudi Arabia, which ranked second. <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Consumer-Energy-Report/2012/0412/Top-15-sources-of-US-crude-oil-imports\">For all of 2011</a>, Canada ranked first, Mexico second and Saudi Arabia third in the number of barrels imported per day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the balance of U.S. imports and exports is improving.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2011, U.S. exports of gasoline, diesel and other fuels exceeded imports for the first time since 1949, according to a claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/11/robert-menendez/robert-menendez-claims-us-oil-exports-surpassed-im/\">rated True</a> by PolitiFact New Jersey. The biggest contributing factor, however, was the increase in foreign purchases of distillate fuel, which includes diesel fuel and heating oil.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson said that every time the price of gasoline increases by 1 cent, &quot;it&#39;s a billion out of our economy that goes to Saudi Arabia.&quot; His campaign said Thompson meant to say Middle East and cited a statistic that covers a one-year period.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFour experts said it would take roughly four to eight years for a 1-cent increase in gas prices to result in an increase of $1 billion in what the U.S. spends to import Saudi oil.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Incidentally, we asked Williams, one of the experts, about the Middle East. He said it would take 3-1/2 years for $1 billion to flow from the U.S. to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar and United Arab Emirates as a result of a penny increase in gas. So, even if Thompson had said Middle East instead of Saudi Arabia, his statement would be inaccurate.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Thompson&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>(You can comment on this item on the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/politifact-testing-thompson-claim-on-gas-prices-money-to-saudi-arabia-o852imf-148091705.html\">Journal Sentinel&#39;s web site</a>)</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em><b style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); \">Editor&#39;s note:</b>&nbsp;On April 20, 2012 we revised this item to note that if the price of a barrel of oil rose by 42 cents, the U.S. would pay Saudi Arabia $501,900 more per day -- or slightly more than $183 million per year.
