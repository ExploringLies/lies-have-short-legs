You know, the Family Research Council, according to some government agencies, is a terrorist group. You know, so let&#39;s get away from the rhetoric and talk about the real problem.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reader asked us to check whether it&rsquo;s true that government agencies had labeled the Family Research Council a terrorist group. So we took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The council would seem like an odd group to be labeled &quot;terrorist.&quot; A prominent think tank for social conservatives, the council hardly lives in the shadows. Its experts appear regularly on television, it has a prominent headquarters building in downtown Washington, and its legislative affiliate sponsors a high-profile annual political conference called the <a href=\"http://www.valuesvotersummit.org/\">Value Voters Summit</a> that attracts a variety of top politicians, including such Republican presidential contenders as &hellip; Ben Carson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t find that any government agencies have labeled the council as a terrorist group. But the council has sparked condemnation from a high-profile civil rights group, and it seems possible that might be what Carson was thinking of. (Neither Carson&rsquo;s staff nor the Family Research Council responded to inquiries for this story.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/\">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> -- a nonprofit based in Montgomery, Ala., that monitors &quot;domestic hate groups and other extremists, including the Ku Klux Klan, the neo-Nazi movement, neo-Confederates, racist skinheads, black separatists, anti-government militias, Christian Identity adherents and others&quot; -- has labeled the Family Research Council <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/family-research-council\">an &quot;extremist group</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, the Southern Poverty Law Center writes on its website that the Family Research Council&rsquo;s &quot;specialty is defaming gays and lesbians. The FRC often makes false claims about the LGBT community based on discredited research and junk science. The intention is to denigrate LGBT people&quot; in various public-policy battles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The center separately lists several of the Family Research Council&rsquo;s leaders, including <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/tony-perkins\">president Tony Perkins</a> and <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/lieutenant-general-william-g-%E2%80%9Cjerry%E2%80%9D-boykin-ret\">retired Lt. Gen William G. (Jerry) Boykin</a>, the group&rsquo;s executive vice president, in its category for individual &quot;extremists.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such designations have <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/16/is-the-family-research-council-really-a-hate-group.html\">flummoxed</a> <a href=\"http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/17/shooting-sparks-controversy-over-hate-designation-for-conservative-group/\">some observers</a>, including some who generally lean liberal, such as <em>Washington Post </em>columnist Dana Milbank, who wrote, &quot;I disagree with the Family Research Council&#39;s views on gays and lesbians. But it&#39;s absurd to put the group, as the law center does, in the same category as Aryan Nations, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Stormfront and the Westboro Baptist Church.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s designation appears to have contributed to a violent incident when 28-year-old Floyd Corkins shot and wounded a security guard at the Family Research Council&rsquo;s headquarters in August 2012. The gunman told law enforcement that he was opposed to the council&rsquo;s socially conservative policies and had targeted the group after using the Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s website. Corkins later pleaded guilty to transporting a firearm over state lines, assault with intent to kill, and committing an act of terrorism while armed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We won&rsquo;t take a position on the Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s designation, but we should note that while calling the Family Research Council an &quot;extremist&quot; group is a serious charge, it&rsquo;s not the same thing as saying the council is a &quot;terrorist&quot; group. The former generally refers to someone who holds extreme views. The latter generally involves something more -- the <em>threat or use of violence </em>to advance such extreme views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, the Southern Poverty Law Center does not consider the Family Research Council a &quot;terrorist&quot; group, said Heidi Beirich, a spokeswoman for the group. &quot;We have no such list,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, there has been some blurring of the lines, at least linguistically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot; &#39;Terrorism&#39;&nbsp;and &#39;violent extremism&#39;&nbsp;are often used interchangeably -- the Obama administration&#39;s policy on countering &#39;violent extremism&#39;&nbsp;was explicitly intended to replace the term &lsquo;terrorism,&#39;&nbsp;&quot; said Charles Kurzman, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill who has studied terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More definitively for the purpose of gauging Carson&rsquo;s statement, the Southern Poverty Law Center is not a government agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So are there any federal agency lists that label the Family Research Council a terrorist group? The only official, public list of terrorist groups is maintained by the State Department, and the Family Research Council isn&rsquo;t on it. That list is designed to catalogue <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm\">foreign terrorist organizations</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, there is no equivalent list for domestic terrorist groups, though the FBI has <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2009/september/domterror_090709\">cited</a> some broad categories that it considers potential sources of domestic terrorism, including <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2008/june/ecoterror_063008\">eco-terrorists and animal rights extremists, </a><a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2010/april/sovereigncitizens_041310/domestic-terrorism-the-sovereign-citizen-movement\">sovereign citizens movements,</a><a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2010/november/anarchist_111610/anarchist_111610\"> anarchist extremism,</a> <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2011/september/militia_092211\">militia extremism</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2012/may/extremism_052212\">white supremacy extremism</a>. The Family Research Council is not mentioned by name in any of these categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security produced a report in April 2009 titled &quot;<a href=\"http://fas.org/irp/eprint/rightwing.pdf\">Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment</a>.&quot; When the report was leaked to the public, the newly installed Obama administration took significant heat from some conservatives who said the report unfairly labeled right-of-center groups as potential sources of violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, neither this report -- nor <a href=\"https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_UnderstandingLawEnforcementIntelligenceProcesses_July2014.pdf\">another Department of Homeland Security study</a> focusing on a broader range of potential ideologically driven threats -- lists the Family Research Council, or, for that matter, any other specific conservative groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I do not know of any source that lists the Family Research Council as a &lsquo;terrorist group,&rsquo; &quot; said Pete Simi, an associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, where he serves as director of radicalization and violent groups research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carson said, &quot;the Family Research Council, according to some government agencies, is a terrorist group.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Family Research Council has been labeled an &quot;extremist&quot; group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, but that&rsquo;s not the same as a &quot;terrorist&quot; group and, more importantly, the center is a private, non-profit group, not a government agency. We could find no government agency that singled out the Family Research Council as a terrorist group, and experts told us they were unaware of any government lists that did. We rate Carson&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-30T17:23:58.082918", "ruling_date": "2015-12-01T12:08:16", "ruling_headline": "Ben Carson incorrect that a government agency considers Family Research Council a terrorist group", "ruling_headline_slug": "ben-carson-incorrect-government-agency-considers-f", "ruling_link_text": "Not on any government list", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Ben Carson, <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1511/29/sotu.02.html\">interview with CNN</a>, Nov. 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/who-robert-dear-planned-parenthood-shooting-suspect-seemed-strange-not-n470896\">Who Is Robert Dear?
