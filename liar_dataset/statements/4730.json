But the vice president was happy to credit the Obama administration with a job well done.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In this case, America spent $2 billion total and didn&rsquo;t lose a single life,&quot; Biden told an audience at Plymouth State University.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;This is more the prescription for how we deal with the world going forward than we have in the past,&quot; he said, arguing that the cost of the operation in Libya was low, both in lives and dollars, compared to other military operations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBiden is right about the fatalities. Few American soldiers set foot in Libya during the seven-month campaign, led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and certainly no fatalities were reported, according to Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Elizabeth Robbins.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut is he correct about the $2 billion figure? We decided to take a look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReached for comment, Biden&rsquo;s office conceded that the vice president&rsquo;s numbers were on the high side, saying that he wanted to leave room for spending that might not be accounted for.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInstead, the VP&rsquo;s office deferred to the Department of Defense, which reports that total spending for the Libya intervention reached $1.1 billion through September 30, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Pentagon&rsquo;s estimate covers the costs of daily military operations, munitions used, humanitarian assistance and the draw-down of supplies, according to Robbins, the department spokeswoman. But that figure likely doesn&#39;t include diplomatic and intelligence operations, among other costs absorbed by the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and other federal agencies, according to military analysts and academics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn most military engagements, the U.S. State Department absorbs some costs, including jet fuel for travel to meetings, among other diplomatic efforts, according to John Pike, director of <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/index.html\">GlobalSecurity.org</a>, an online security information database. &quot;Any place that you are aware of that has uniformed military personnel, there were State Department personnel involved in getting them into it,&quot; Pike said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFurther, the CIA. regularly conducts classified intelligence missions that are often not included in Pentagon estimates, Pike said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese costs, among others associated with military efforts, are nearly impossible to track. Neither the <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/\">Congressional Budget Office</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/\">Government Accountability Office</a> nor the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/\">White House Office of Management and Budget</a> monitor these numbers, according agency media relations representatives. And the North Atlantic Treaty Organization does not differentiate costs by country, according to a NATO spokesman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven if there are many peripheral costs, however, they pale in comparison to the Defense Department totals, according to analysts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe operational costs of war are typically so high -- $330 billion so far in Afghanistan and $708 billion in Iraq, according to Pentagon estimates -- that diplomatic, intelligence and other supplementary costs barely make a drop in the budget, according to Todd Harrison, senior fellow for defense budget studies at the <a href=\"http://www.csbaonline.org/\">Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments</a>, a public policy research institute in Washington, D.C.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There could be additional costs to the operation outside the DoD budget. &hellip; However, these costs are likely to be small relative to the military costs of the operation,&quot; Harrison wrote in an email. &quot;I suspect they would only add a few percent to the total cost.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling:</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBiden&rsquo;s numbers were high to leave room for unaccounted costs, as his office acknowledges. The vice president&rsquo;s $2 billion figure is nearly double the $1.1 billion reported by the Pentagon and largely supported by military analysts. But, those same analysts note that there are other costs related to military actions that often are not reported.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNevertheless, even the higher number supports Biden&rsquo;s deeper point. The military intervention in Libya -- in addition to not resulting in a single American military fatality -- cost the country less than 1 percent what the Pentagon has spent in Iraq and Afghanistan. We rate Biden&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-03T12:31:09.529032", "ruling_date": "2011-11-03T15:24:40", "ruling_headline": "Biden calls Libya a job well done", "ruling_headline_slug": "biden-calls-libya-job-well-done", "ruling_link_text": "The costs were relatively low", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tE-mail exchange with the Vice President&rsquo;s Office, October 26, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Elizabeth Robbins, spokeswoman for the Department of Defense, October 26, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail exchange with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, October 26, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Charles Young, spokesman for the Government Accountability Office, November 1, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Deborah Kilroe, spokesperson for the Congressional Budget Office, November 1, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Meg Reilly, spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget, November 1, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Stuart Levey, senior fellow for national security and financial integrity at the Council on Foreign Relations, November 1, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Wendy Snyder, spokeswoman for the Department of Defense, November 2, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, November 2, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Todd Harrison, senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, November 2, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "U.S. senator", "false_count": 10, "first_name": "Joe", "half_true_count": 21, "home_state": "Delaware", "id": 11, "last_name": "Biden", "mostly_true_count": 16, "name_slug": "joe-biden", "pants_count": 4, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-joebiden.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/11/", "total_count": 78, "true_count": 13, "website": "http://www.joebiden.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tIn Libya, &quot;America spent $2 billion total and didn&rsquo;t lose a single life.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a talk at Plymouth State University in Plymouth, N.H.", "statement_date": "2011-10-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 30, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/30/", "subject": "Military", "subject_slug": "military", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 214, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/214/", "subject": "New Hampshire 2012", "subject_slug": "new-hampshire-2012", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
