Paul Broun wants you to reach for your checkbook. A Second Amendment rights group needs money to keep the United Nations from coming for your guns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Athens Republican made his pitch in a YouTube video posted by the National Association for Gun Rights.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If passed by the U.N. and ratified by the U.S. Senate, the U.N. Small Arms Treaty would almost certainly force the United States to &hellip; create an international gun registry, setting the stage for full-scale gun confiscation,&quot; Broun said during the video posted July 10.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTreaty negotiations fell apart in late July, but advocates are hopeful that a version will pass soon.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe therefore took a closer look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia asked Broun for more information, but his spokeswoman refused repeated requests for comment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe soldiered on. PolitiFact Georgia interviewed gun rights experts, especially those who, like Broun, are critical of gun control. We also consulted past PolitiFact coverage of the arms treaty.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe U.N. has mulled over a treaty to regulate the global arms trade for years. Backers say it would curtail mass killings and terrorism, and keep dictators from killing their own people.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Small arms are not the treaty&rsquo;s sole focus, as Broun&rsquo;s description suggests. Conventional weapons, including guns, missiles and attack helicopters, are.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe George W. Bush administration rebuffed the effort, but the Obama administration said in 2009 that it is open to negotiations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2010, PolitiFact National evaluated a claim that under the treaty, &quot;all U.S. citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the unlikely event that the president and two-thirds of the Senate agreed to a treaty that bans guns and requires their confiscation, long-standing Supreme Court precedent would make it unenforceable, it said in ruling the claim False.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn May, PolitiFact Texas tested a claim that &quot;Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are negotiating with the United Nations about doing a treaty that will ban the use of firearms.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt ruled Pants on Fire because an administration official recently said the U.S. will not back a treaty that infringes on the Second Amendment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo &quot;full-scale gun confiscation&quot; in the U.S. is out of the picture. What about an international gun registry?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGun control critics pointed us to a July 26 draft posted on the website of a pro-disarmament group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tArticle 2 states that each party &quot;shall establish or update, as appropriate, and maintain a national control list&quot; that would include battle tanks, attack helicopters and guns, among other things.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Even the most limited reading of the treaty suggests that, while it would not create an international registry of all guns, it seeks to create one of all imported guns,&quot; said Ted Bromund, a senior research fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut no treaty language establishes a worldwide registry of individuals who own guns or dealers who sell to customers in their own countries.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, the draft affirms the &quot;sovereign right and responsibility of any State to regulate and control transfers of conventional arms that take place exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional systems.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrior General Assembly resolutions contain similar language.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOfficial U.N. statements emphasize that a treaty would regulate international import, export and transfers of conventional arms only.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Nobody wants to control the transfer of weapons inside a country,&quot; said Tom Collina, the research director of the Arms Control Association.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf course, this version of the treaty failed in U.N. negotiations. Even if it had succeeded, U.S. ratification would be unlikely, our anti-gun control experts agreed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, we opted to take Broun&rsquo;s statement further. He posits an alternate political reality where leaders ratify a treaty that could lead the U.S. to create a registry to track -- and ultimately confiscate -- guns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia asked legal experts whether one would be constitutional.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey gave differing opinions. The Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, thinks registries would pass constitutional muster because they don&rsquo;t &quot;materially interfere with the ability to keep guns for self-defense.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDave Kopel, a legal expert with the pro-free market Independence Institute, called registration a &quot;gray area, legally speaking.&quot; &nbsp;A future court could overturn Second Amendment precedent, Kopel said. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Like so much else in constitutional law, the answer is &lsquo;it depends,&rsquo; &quot; said Brannon P. Denning, a professor at Samford University&rsquo;s Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow do we rule?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA draft of the U.N. treaty would require the U.S. to report information on international arms sales only -- not domestic sales. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut &quot;full-scale gun confiscation&quot; would not be constitutional. A domestic registry may not be. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis means that even in the unlikely event that the U.N. creates a treaty that provides for domestic registries and the U.S. Senate ratifies it, it would not &quot;almost certainly force&quot; the U.S. to create one.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBroun&rsquo;s statement contains the tiniest sliver of truth. The treaty would track international gun sales. But his claim makes it sound like the U.N. will keep a registry of all gun owners across the world. That&rsquo;s a bizarre distortion of the facts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis claim is False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-09T15:03:13.099392", "ruling_date": "2012-08-10T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Broun: U.N. treaty likely to lead to international gun registry", "ruling_headline_slug": "broun-un-treaty-likely-lead-international-gun-regi", "ruling_link_text": "Put a bullet in this claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tYouTube, National Association for Gun Rights, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cBMyx8PzO8&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Rep.
