Scott Walker&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf\">budget-repair bill</a>, which was introduced 10 days earlier. That measure would require most public employees to pay more for benefits, to help close a deficit in the state budget ending June 30, 2011. It would also eliminate collective bargaining rights for some public employees and sharply curtail them for others, a move Walker says is aimed at helping balance future state and local government budgets.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPaul, a freshman senator and <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/senate-tea-party-caucus-holds-first-meeting/\">co-founder</a> of the Senate Tea Party Caucus, responded to Letterman&rsquo;s question by saying:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;But I guess the argument is -- is, you have to look at the details and say: Have we been generous with (public school) teachers in Wisconsin? The average teacher in Wisconsin&rsquo;s making $89,000 a year to work nine months.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs Paul right?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe $89,000 claim prompted this <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=47326583374&amp;topic=16802\">comment</a> from a guy named Tom on the Wisconsin Unions page of the Facebook website: &quot;Holy cats, Batman, my wife is hiding $40,000 a year from her paychecks.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPaul made a similar claim, varying his wording a little, a day earlier on ABC-TV&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/\">&quot;Good Morning America.&quot;</a> He told host George Stephanopoulos that Wisconsin teachers &quot;are making $89,000 a year. Their benefits greatly exceed the private sector.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the Letterman interview, Paul seemed to be saying $89,000 was the average salary for a public school teacher in Wisconsin. But on &quot;Good Morning America,&quot; he seemed to suggest that the $89,000 included salary plus benefits, just as Fox Business Network anchor Eric Bolling did in making a similar <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/23/eric-bolling/fox-business-news-eric-bolling-says-wisconsin-teac/\">claim that was assessed</a> by our colleagues at PolitiFact National.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe left messages with two staffers in the senator&rsquo;s office, asking for clarification of Paul&rsquo;s statements and for evidence to back up the figure, but got no response.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the Wisconsin budget debate, both sides have said it&rsquo;s important to look at overall compensation -- pay and benefits. So, by that measure, is the average public school teacher in Wisconsin &quot;making $89,000 a year&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe latest figures available are for 2009-2010, according to a state Department of Public Instruction spokesman. Public school teachers in Wisconsin earned an average of $49,816 in salary plus $25,325 in benefits for a total of $75,141.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s about 16 percent less than the $89,000 claimed by Paul.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe $75,141 total compensation figure, of course, is a statewide average.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe figures vary across districts, according to <a href=\"http://dpi.state.wi.us/lbstat/newasr.html\">tallies</a> from the Department of Public Instruction. The average total compensation ranged from just over $55,000 in the <a href=\"http://www.linn6.k12.wi.us/\">Linn Joint 6 School </a><a href=\"http://www.linn6.k12.wi.us/\">District</a> in Lake Geneva near the Wisconsin-Illinois border to just over $103,000 in the <a href=\"http://www.nicolet.k12.wi.us/\">Nicolet </a><a href=\"http://www.nicolet.k12.wi.us/\">district</a> in suburban Milwaukee. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTime for the Truth-O-Meter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPaul said twice on national television that the average public school teacher in Wisconsin &quot;is making $89,000 a year.&quot; We&rsquo;re assuming his figure isn&rsquo;t just for salary, in which case his number would be too high by $40,000. But even if he meant salary plus benefits, his figure is too high by $14,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Paul&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Editor&rsquo;s note: On March 8, 2011, this item was changed to correct an error in information provided by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.
