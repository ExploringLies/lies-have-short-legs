Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, the co-leader of the latest get-tough push, recently confronted that critique head-on while arguing to make third-offense drunken-driving a felony in Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We can&rsquo;t just say, &lsquo;It costs too much,&rsquo;&quot; Darling <a href=\"http://www.wiseye.org/Programming/VideoArchive/EventDetail.aspx?evhdid=7880\">said in testimony</a> before an Assembly committee Aug. 15, 2013. &quot;What does that say to the victims and the victims&rsquo; families, that it costs too much to make a third do-over a felony? Why does it have to be a fourth offense as a felony?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then she made a geographical appeal, twice saying during the hearing that Wisconsin is &quot;way out of line&quot; with some Midwestern neighbors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The states surrounding us, Illinois, Iowa and Indiana, have the second offense as a felony,&quot; Darling said. &quot;That tells me that that is a reasonable public policy, that other states that are like-minded, that are Midwesterners with similar values, feel that&rsquo;s what is appropriate. To me that counts. We are way out of line, that you get three do-overs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s well known that Wisconsin is the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/lawmakers-consider-tougher-measures-for-drunken-drivers-dh5prbk-161287125.html\">only state</a> in which first-offense drunken driving is not charged as a crime; it&rsquo;s treated as a civil matter featuring stiff money forfeitures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the second is still a civil forfeiture if the new offense is more than 10 years after the first, though it&rsquo;s a criminal misdemeanor if it&rsquo;s within the decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we wondered if the gap between the Badger State and our close neighbors on felony OWI is as stark as Darling described.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we compared Wisconsin&rsquo;s law to that in the three states Darling mentioned, plus border states Minnesota and Michigan. Darling did not explicitly mention them, but they meet her definition of &quot;surrounding us&quot; (especially compared to Indiana, which doesn&rsquo;t touch Wisconsin).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll confine our review to incidents that involve no aggravating factors such as causing injury or having children in the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what we found:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wisconsin</strong>: The fourth offense here is a felony that carries a prison term of six months to six years -- but only if a previous offense was within the last five years. Otherwise, that fourth offense is a criminal misdemeanor with a 60 day to 1 year term, <a href=\"http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/safety/docs/owi-penchrt.pdf\">state penalty information</a> shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third offense is now a criminal misdemeanor. The <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2013/proposals/sb60\">bill</a> that Darling and Rep. Jim Ott, R-Mequon, have introduced with 13 co-sponsors would change that third offense to a Class H felony with a minimum of 45 days of imprisonment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the bill would make fourth offense OWI a felony regardless of the timing of prior convictions. Much stiffer sentences would apply if the fourth is within five years of a prior incident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Iowa</strong>: Drunken driving becomes a felony quicker than under current Wisconsin law, but upon the third offense, not the second as Darling said. The first and second offenses are both criminal misdemeanors -- an aggravated one in the case of second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Illinois: </strong>As in Iowa, it&rsquo;s the third offense that is a felony. The first two offenses are criminal misdemeanors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Michigan</strong>: The same as Iowa and Illinois -- third offense is a <a href=\"http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1627_8665-24488--,00.html\">felony in Michigan</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> The second offense is a felony if it&rsquo;s within 5 years of the prior conviction. If the time gap is wider, it gets charged as a misdemeanor -- and that holds true even if it&rsquo;s a third or fourth offense or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> As in Wisconsin, drunken driving without any aggravating factors is not charged as a crime until the fourth offense. Minnesota sweeps in offenses from the prior 10 years, though, compared with Wisconsin&rsquo;s five.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In sum, four out of our five closest neighbors clearly make drunken driving a felony faster than does Wisconsin. Minnesota, by contrast, is much like Wisconsin on this score.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So &quot;out of line&quot; clearly would apply. But &quot;way&quot; out of line?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a subjective phrase, but Darling defined it in a specific way -- that the others make drunken driving a felony on second offense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By that measure, Darling was wrong -- with one exception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the surrounding states, only in Indiana is OWI a felony at second offense, and only if the offense is within five years of the first episode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bob Delaporte, a Darling aide, told us Darling misspoke in saying some of Wisconsin&rsquo;s neighboring states make it a felony at second offense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we close, a disclaimer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This analysis was confined to a simple look at when a felony classification kicks in. We did not try to sort out here the many complexities involved in determining whether one state&rsquo;s law is truly &quot;tougher&quot; or &quot;weaker&quot; when factors such as plea bargaining and sentencing variations are considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, a felony conviction undeniably packs a special punch, in terms of the loss of rights and stigma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A felony is such a career killer,&quot; said Donald Ramsell, an Illinois attorney and national expert on drunken driving penalties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nationally, about half the states mirror Wisconsin&rsquo;s current approach or are more lenient in terms of when -- or if -- a felony charge enters the picture, various state surveys show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Darling said Wisconsin&rsquo;s drunken-driving penalties are &quot;way out of line&quot; with &quot;states surrounding us,&quot; which &quot;have the second offense as a felony.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to Wisconsin, where fourth offense can be a felony, four out of five of the state&rsquo;s closest neighbors make it a felony faster than Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But only one does so at the second offense as Darling said. Three put the threshold at third offense, and another puts it at fourth, as in Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a gap between Wisconsin and neighboring states, so there&rsquo;s an element of truth here, but for the most part that gap is not as wide as Darling said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate her claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-08-21T18:06:48.172494", "ruling_date": "2013-08-25T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Alberta Darling says Wisconsin\u2019s neighbors make a felony of second-offense drunken-driving", "ruling_headline_slug": "alberta-darling-says-wisconsins-neighbors-make-fel", "ruling_link_text": "Third offense is a felony, in most", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wisconsin Eye, video archive, <a href=\"http://www.wiseye.org/Programming/VideoArchive/EventDetail.aspx?evhdid=7880\">Assembly Judiciary Committee hearing on OWI bills</a>, Aug. 15, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Bob Delaporte, aide to Sen.
