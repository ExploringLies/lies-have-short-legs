Yet on Nov. 15, 2011, she hit the brakes: Texas would not disburse $25 million in advance of the first race, <a href=\"http://www.window.state.tx.us/newsinfo/columns/111115-formula1.html\">she announced</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe put her statement through PolitiFact&rsquo;s Flip-O-Meter.

Rick Perry praised her efforts. In the<a href=\"http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Bill_81/6_FSU/Bill-81-6_FSU_0909.pdf\"> 2010-11 budget</a>, approved in 2009, lawmakers <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/texas-politics/texas-taxpayers-would-foot-1st-formula-one-bill-721621.html\">sent $25 million to Combs</a> to be placed in the Major Events Trust Fund, whence she could distribute the money under the terms of a <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CV/htm/CV.83.10.htm#5190.14\">2003 statute</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCombs&rsquo; agreement to pay in advance was spelled out in <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/pdf/11/combsmay102010letter.pdf\">a May 10, 2010, letter</a>:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;With the understanding that the first Formula 1 United States Grand Prix race will be held in Texas in 2012, full funding on the entire sanction for 2012 will be paid to Formula OneWorld Championship Limited (&lsquo;FOWC&rsquo;) no later than July 31st, 2011.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe sanction, <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/sports/formula1/circuit-of-americas-official-says-revised-f1-contract-1993437.html\">reported by the Statesman</a> to be $25 million under the original contract, is the first of ten $25 million annual payments Texas committed to in writing. Payment was delayed when Austin&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2011/08/31/fia_confirms_inaugural_austin.html?cxntfid=blogs_formula_austin\">race date was put back</a> from June 17, 2012, to Nov. 18, 2012.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut Combs&rsquo; <a href=\"http://www.window.state.tx.us/newsinfo/columns/111115-formula1.html\">Nov. 15 statement</a> was the first official notice that Texas would not pay until after the race was held.

Specifically, Combs spokeswoman Brooke Botello told us, &quot;It is not a change of position; rather, it&rsquo;s adhering to the statute.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The ability to advance funds, according to the statute, is discretionary,&quot; Botello emailed us Nov. 22. &quot;Considering the events of late, we used that discretion and decided &ndash; due to the events outlined in the attached &ndash; it would not be prudent to advance the funds.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the attachment Botello mentions, which is <a href=\"http://www.window.state.tx.us/newsinfo/columns/111115-formula1.html\">Combs&rsquo; Nov. 15 statement</a>, the comptroller lists the recently announced <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/sports/formula1/new-jersey-will-host-second-f1-event-in-1934006.html\">Formula One race in New Jersey</a>, set for 2013; <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/local/slowdown-raises-questions-about-future-of-f1-1887471.html\">slowed construction</a> at the Central Texas site; and <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2011/11/17/combs_joins_list_of_austin_f1.html\">disagreements between Formula One and race promoters</a> that &quot;prompted speculation about whether the Austin race will even occur.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur ruling: Combs may have been justified in her recent statement that no state money would go to the race in advance. Still, it&rsquo;s a reversal of her earlier promise.
