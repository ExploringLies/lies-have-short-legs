By that measure, Leibham and Grothman each got between 98 and 99 percent from Badger State residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Concentration of small givers: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slightly more than 76 percent of Grothman&rsquo;s individual donations were $100 or less. The comparable figure for Leibham: just over 75 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, basically even.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On donations of under $200 -- the threshold at which the Federal Election Commission allows candidates not to itemize donors by name -- Grothman had a larger advantage: 79 percent to 74 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Leibham discloses names and other information on all donations; Grothman, as is true for many candidates, discloses smaller donations only as a lump-sum number, as the FEC allows. He shared additional detail with us for this story. The candidates&rsquo; fundraising reports are on the<a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/candcmte_info.shtml\"> FEC website</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Money total from small givers:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leibham ran ahead of Grothman on total funds from those giving $100 or less per donation, $46,000 to $41,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Number of small and in-state donations:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leibham attracted almost 200 more sub-$101 contributions than Grothman, and about 300 more total donations from Wisconsinites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Big money donations:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leibham gets a slightly larger share of his contributions from people giving $1,000 or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, the pair get basically the same, very large share of their support from in-state donors and from small donations, but Leibham does more volume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grothman campaign spokesman Brandon VerVelde told us Grothman should get credit for winning straw polls at GOP events. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps he should, but the candidate&rsquo;s statement was about fundraising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grothman boasted that, &quot;The fundraising numbers are in, and our grassroots support is unmatched!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the numbers show that Leibham matched or out-did Grothman on most measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That reads as pretty matched to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Grothman&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-07-25T16:16:10.770637", "ruling_date": "2014-07-27T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Glenn Grothman says he leads in grassroots financial backing", "ruling_headline_slug": "glenn-grothman-says-he-leads-grassroots-financial-", "ruling_link_text": "Except by rival Joe Leibham", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview with Brandon VerVelde, Grothman campaign spokesman, July 24, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Ryan Terrill, spokesman for Leibham campaign, July 24, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Judith Ingram, FEC press officer, July 24, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Christian Hilland, FEC spokesman, July 24, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grothman campaign <a href=\"http://www.glenngrothman.com/grothman_campaign_has_strongest_grassroots_support_in_race\">press release,</a> July 15, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leibham campaign <a href=\"http://www.leibham.com/#!Leibham-Campaign-Raises-over-300000-/c1dqg/28DE8770-63DB-419D-ADC3-FECD685346FD\">press release,</a> July 15, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "U.S. representative", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "Glenn", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 874, "last_name": "Grothman", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "glenn-grothman", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Glenn_Grothman.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/874/", "total_count": 13, "true_count": 4, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The fundraising numbers are in, and our grassroots support is unmatched!&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in a Facebook posting", "statement_date": "2014-07-15", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
