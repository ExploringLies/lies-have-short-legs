Raimondo did not claim that she created those jobs in Rhode Island -- though many people have taken away that impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So do more people work in Pell&rsquo;s campaign than at Narragansett Beer?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, we checked with Pell&rsquo;s campaign manager, Devin Driscoll. Driscoll said the campaign has 40 paid employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driscoll listed those jobs in an email:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Team Pell has a field staff of thirty: three deputy field organizers (DFOs); twenty-three field organizers (FOs); two regional field directors (RFD); a deputy field director (DFD) and a field director.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driscoll said the field organizers are paid an entry-level salary equivalent to $36,000 a year. He declined to enumerate other salaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We also have a headquarters staff of ten: a driver, training director, policy director, digital director, GOTV director, Women for Pell director, operations director, scheduling director, deputy campaign manager and campaign manager.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All 40 of these folks are full-time and salaried, with the exception of three DFOs, who are stipended. Our FOs make a very competitive salary for organizers -- $36,000 a year, plus benefits (we offer healthcare through HealthSource RI to all salaried employees).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driscoll said he started on January 1, and &quot;we started onboarding field staff in May.&quot; The last workers joined the campaign in June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The campaign also has a Rhode Island-based finance director, Driscoll said, who is a consultant. Three people have left in the past two weeks to go to college or graduate school: a driver, a press assistant, and our data director, Driscoll said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be fair, these jobs are not permanent. Should Pell become the next governor, it is fair to say that the entire campaign staff won&rsquo;t join him at the State House. Should Pell lose the election, Team Pell would be disbanded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, we checked with Mark Hellendrung, president of Narragansett Beer, which was brewed in Rhode Island from 1890 through 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hellendrung said that, in addition to himself, there are six Rhode Island residents and two Massachusetts residents working full-time for the company in Rhode Island, for a total of nine. Four people work full-time out of state in sales and marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said there are about 50 part-time employees who work at promotions events all over the East Coast; 20 of them live and work in Rhode Island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company is headquartered &nbsp;in Providence, but Hellendrung said the beer is now brewed in Rochester, N.Y., Pawcatuck, Conn., and Westport, Mass. Test batches have been brewed locally in Rhode Island; ultimately, the company hopes to open a brewery here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clay Pell says that his campaign has created &quot;more jobs in the state of Rhode Island than Narragansett Beer,&quot; a poke at Gina Raimondo&rsquo;s claim that she helped bring Narragansett Beer back to Rhode Island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pell campaign provided a list of 40 campaign jobs; Narragansett Beer said it has 9 full-time employees in Rhode Island; 20 part-time people who work promotional events in Rhode Island; and four full-time employees out of state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A major difference is that the Pell jobs are short-term and, one way or the other, most or all will be gone no later than November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we hoist a pint to Pell and rate it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mostly True</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>PolitiFact Rhode Island</u></a> to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
