Mayor Sam Adams, who orchestrated the plan, was on OPB&rsquo;s Think Out Loud last week touting the proposal as a way to boost music and arts education for children.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the other side was veteran tax activist Don McIntire. He called the plan &quot;cockamamie&quot; and &quot;frivolous,&quot; and one which Adams and the city had no business promoting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We&rsquo;re spending $12,000 bucks a kid a year in the school system. If they&rsquo;re not getting art training that&rsquo;s the fault of the school system and that needs to be rectified,&quot; McIntire said on <a href=\"http://www.opb.org/thinkoutloud/shows/proposed-portland-arts-tax/\">Think Out Loud</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPolitiFact Oregon rang up McIntire for his source. He didn&#39;t specify Portland Public Schools on the radio, but he made clear to us that he was talking about the state&#39;s largest school district. He said it&rsquo;s a national average, and he suspects PPS is even higher. In getting back to us with more information, McIntire upped the ante to $15,000 per student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His math is terrifically simple. Follow along.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe adopted budget for <a href=\"http://www.pps.k12.or.us/files/budget/1213_Approved_Budget_%28Final%29.pdf\">Portland Public Schools is $678 million for 2012-13</a>. Resources include a beginning balance, food service sales and government funding. The expenditures category includes salaries, materials and debt service. McIntire subtracted about $11 million for fund transfers, which leaves roughly $667 million.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDivide that by<a href=\"http://www.pps.k12.or.us/about-us/index.htm\"> 47,288 students -- which is current enrollment </a>-- and voila, $14,100 per student. McIntire also said we should add $900 per student for education service district support. That, he said, gets us to $15,000.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe asked him if it was fair to include building costs or debt service. Obviously those are not dollars going toward student instruction. McIntire said that it&rsquo;s entirely fair &quot;if money is taken and derived from the taxpaying public, and it goes into the system somewhere and it&rsquo;s spent.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOK, let&rsquo;s move on. Next we asked Matt Shelby, spokesman for Portland Public Schools, to ask his people for a figure. He said he&rsquo;d get back to us. Because PolitiFact Oregon is always on the move, we started looking online and found that the<a href=\"http://www2.census.gov/govs/school/10f33pub.pdf\"> U.S. average in per pupil spending was $10,615 in 2009-10, according to the U.S. Census Bureau</a>. So, there&rsquo;s some context.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Oregon, according to the bureau, the number was lower: $9,624 per pupil (page 8). In Portland Public Schools, however, the number was higher: $10,949 (page 106). The averages included salaries and support services, with a portion for school and general administration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe turned to the Oregon Department of Education, <a href=\"http://www.ode.state.or.us/data/reports/toc.aspx#finance/funding\">which tracks spending by school district</a>. We zeroed in on a report called operating versus capital expenditures per student. This looked like the report we needed. Hurray!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere we found that the actual amount of money spent statewide per student, on average, in 2010-11 was $9,362. In Portland Public Schools, the per student spending was higher at $11,830. That is very close to $12,000. To short-circuit the process, we asked Shelby the spokesman if Portland Public Schools officials were comfortable with that breakdown. He said they were.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe will not rule on McIntire&rsquo;s revised statement that the district spends about $15,000 on each student a year. He and others may think that&rsquo;s a better estimate of how much money the district has -- and therefore, what it can afford to spend on arts education -- but that&rsquo;s not what he said publicly. We will rule on the $12,000 per student figure instead.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe best historical numbers we have are state figures that show that Portland Public Schools in 2010-11 spent $11,830 per pupil. (The same report shows capital outlay per student was about $400, and $777 statewide.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, let&rsquo;s go back to Portland Public Schools&rsquo; 2012-13 adopted budget. If you add together salaries, benefits, materials and services -- in other words, take out debt, capital and contingencies-- you get nearly $542 million. Divide that by the number of students and we end up at $11,459 per student. Again, we think that&rsquo;s pretty close to $12,000.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith debt and capital -- the way McIntire and some others think is more accurate -- the number would be more than $12,000. It would be anywhere from $13,200 (without contingency and ending fund balance) to $14,100 (if those categories are included) to $15,000 (if he is correctly adding education service district costs to the budget).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis larger point is that the district, spending roughly $12,000 a student, has enough money to pay for arts and music classes. A higher number just makes his point stronger.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhether any of that is enough for Portland Public Schools to offer art and music instruction without a $35 per-person income tax is not for us to decide. McIntire&rsquo;s statement is accurate and we rule it True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-03T20:43:10.395748", "ruling_date": "2012-07-03T17:32:39", "ruling_headline": "Does Portland Public Schools spend $12,000 a year per student?
