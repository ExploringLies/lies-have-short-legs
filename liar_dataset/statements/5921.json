Obama&#39;s plan is to sneak it in after the November elections to keep it under the radar,&quot; the e-mail, which was sent to PolitiFact New Jersey on May 12, said. &quot;This is a 1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution - banks, credit unions, savings and loans, etc. Any deposit you make, or even a transfer within your own bank from one account to another, will have a 1% tax charged.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If your paycheck or your Social Security or whatever is direct deposit, it will get a 1% tax charged for the transaction,&quot; the e-mail claims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDon&rsquo;t empty your bank accounts and plan a life off the grid quite yet. Neither the president nor his financial team are recommending such a measure, PolitiFact New Jersey found. The idea comes from a Pennsylvania congressman&rsquo;s proposal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah, a Democrat, first advanced the concept in the House in 2004 when he introduced a bill that would have required a study on eliminating all federal taxes on individuals and corporations and replacing that revenue stream with transaction fees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill had no co-sponsors and died in committee. Fattah introduced similar legislation several times after his first attempt calling for a study. Only one of those bills gained a co-sponsor, but none of them made it out of committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2010, Fattah ditched the calls for a study and introduced a bill -- called the &quot;Debt Free America Act&quot; -- to implement a one-percent transaction fee on &quot;any transaction that uses a payment instrument, including any check, cash, credit card, transfer of stock, bonds, or other financial instrument.&quot; &nbsp;Any transactions involving stocks were excluded from the fee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith the fee, the bill &quot;intended to raise sufficient revenue to eliminate the national debt&quot; and &quot;phase out the income tax on individuals.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Debt Free America Act is the legislation the e-mail claims Obama and his financial team are recommending, though it&rsquo;s the work of one congressman and the proposal never left committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince the e-mail, a version of which <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2010/nov/12/chain-email/e-mail-claims-obamas-financial-team-wants-1-percen/\">PolitiFact Rhode Island deemed Pants on Fire</a> in November 2010, started circulating, Fattah reintroduced the legislation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe most recent bill, introduced in March 2011, still applies a one-percent transaction fee, but excludes personal bank account transactions in addition to transactions involving stocks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt has no co-sponsors and was again referred to committee, where it remains.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn e-mail claims that the president&rsquo;s finance team recommends a &quot;1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s ridiculous. A Pennsylvania congressman has sponsored a bill that would levy a one-percent fee on some financial transactions. But nearly every year he has introduced the legislation it gained no support. And none of the bills have ever left committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama -- and his financial team -- have nothing to do with the legislation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe set this e-mail claim ablaze.
