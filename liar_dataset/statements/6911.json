Tommy Thompson won the bruising Republican primary for U.S. Senate. And the general election race against Democrat Tammy Baldwin has featured plenty of punches from both sides.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson was asked about negative advertising during an Oct. 5, 2012, appearance at a Milwaukee Press Club Newsmaker Luncheon. He expressed disappointment, and said the tone didn&rsquo;t reflect his personality.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&rsquo;m very sad about the negative ads,&quot; Thompson said. &quot;I&rsquo;m a positive guy. I&rsquo;m optimistic.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe noted that when he successfully challenged Democrat Gov. Anthony Earl in 1986, the two &quot;ran a fantastic election, we ran an election all over the state and that always was positive.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd then Thompson turned the blame on his opponent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Congresswoman Baldwin has had not one positive ad. Not one.... Not one positive ad. Why? Because she hasn&rsquo;t done anything.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA few days after the statement, the Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s Craig Gilbert <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/173221301.html\">wrote about </a><br />\r\n\ta report by Kantar Media CMAG, a D.C. firm that tracks political ads, that found in the 30 days that ended Oct. 2, 2012, 92% of the ads aired in the race were &quot;negative.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s more, the report showed that in the weeks after the primary, between Aug. 19 and Sept. 17, 2012, Baldwin and her allies outspent Thompson and his allies almost 3-to-1 on broadcast television.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tComplaining and finger-pointing about the tone of the race is nothing new in politics. But Thompson made a very specific claim about Baldwin, and suggested she is to blame for the negativity.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs he on the money?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be sure, the battle for the U.S. Senate seat was bitter long before the general election, but only on the Republican side. Thompson topped three opponents in the August primary, while Baldwin faced no opponent, though she has been on television since early summer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat split nature of the race creates a bit of a problem when it comes to evaluating Thompson&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWas Thompson talking about the entirety of the campaign or was he referring to the head-to-head battle with Baldwin?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom the context of the specific question, about how negative ads had erased Thompson&rsquo;s lead in the polls, it&rsquo;s reasonable to believe Thompson was speaking about ads in the general election race. And he referred to the general election campaign that he waged against former Gov. Earl.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that&rsquo;s not what he said -- Thompson said all of Baldwin&rsquo;s ads had been negative.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked his campaign to provide backup for his statement and was told they would get back to us but didn&rsquo;t.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, let&rsquo;s start with the primary season.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s when Baldwin was able to play Rock-Paper-Engines. Those were the titles of her TV ads.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA June 17, 2012, ad, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnA721TRjl0\">&quot;Paper&quot;</a>, discussed Baldwin&rsquo;s efforts to sanction China for breaking trade rules and hurting the U.S. paper industry. The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3uX1neKHLM&amp;feature=youtu.be\">&quot;Rock,&quot;</a>ad, which began running July 9, was biographical in nature. On July 30, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PuH0ynsRHM\">&quot;Engines&quot;</a>began, claiming Baldwin &quot;led the fight&quot; to force the Coast Guard to buy engines from American manufacturers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNone of those ads mentioned Thompson or the other Republican contenders.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat tone changed after the Aug. 14, 2012, primary, starting the following week with an ad called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEgKPv3nFiM\">&quot;Choice.&quot;</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn it, Baldwin talks about three tax-cut votes of her own, and then turns her sights on Thompson, calling him &quot;the guy who&rsquo;s gotten rich working for D.C. lobbyists&quot; and saying he &quot;wants to give a $265,000 tax cut to millionaires like himself while raising taxes on the middle class.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe followed up a few days later with another ad criticizing Thompson for refusing to release his tax returns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ihWIy1YiSg&amp;feature=em-uploademail\">early September ad</a>, Baldwin attacked Thompson&rsquo;s record as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The ad said Thompson &quot;cut a sweetheart deal with drug companies making it illegal for them to negotiate lower prescription drug prices.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, since the primary, the ads have been negative. The same can be said of Thompson&rsquo;s ads.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus noted Thompson vowed numerous times that he would run a positive campaign. He argued Thompson was the first to go negative against Baldwin, even before the primary and cited a July ad, <a href=\"http://althouse.blogspot.com/2012/07/tommy-thompson-coming-at-you-on-his.html\">&quot;Repeal&quot;</a>showing Thompson on a Harley.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn it, Thompson pledges to be the &quot;51st vote&quot; to repeal &quot;Obamacare.&quot; Baldwin&rsquo;s face appears briefly superimposed on the road, with the note she supports the federal health care law. (There is no question about that. She voted for it and has even suggested going further.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs with the Baldwin side, the negative lines become much clearer after the primary.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn other ads, Thompson has said Baldwin supports a massive tax increase, describes her as &quot;too extreme for Wisconsin,&quot; and says she&rsquo;s more liberal than Nancy Pelosi and President Barack Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGroups on both sides of the race have also ran negative ads, contributing to the all-negative sense about the race.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the Press Club event, Thompson said Baldwin had not aired &quot;one positive ad&quot; in the campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat is certainly true for the general election, and it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that&rsquo;s what he was referring to. But a longer view of the campaign, extending before the primary, provides a very different picture.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-12T18:36:42.747998", "ruling_date": "2012-10-15T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Thompson says Baldwin has not run any positive ads in Senate campaign", "ruling_headline_slug": "thompson-says-baldwin-has-not-run-any-positive-ads", "ruling_link_text": "The mud didn't fly until after the primary", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ihWIy1YiSg&amp;feature=em-uploademail\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.5433932799903778\">Baldwin campaign ad &quot;Boy Did He, </a>&quot;Sept. 10, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvpAsrw0DYs&amp;feature=player_embedded#%21\">Baldwin campaign ad, &quot;No&quot;</a>, Aug. 23, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEgKPv3nFiM\">Baldwin campaign ad, &quot;Choice,&quot;</a>Aug. 17, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PuH0ynsRHM\">Baldwin campaign ad, &quot;Engines,&quot; </a>July 30, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3uX1neKHLM&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Baldwin campaign ad, &quot;Rock,&quot; </a>July 9, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnA721TRjl0\">Baldwin campaign ad, &quot;Paper,&quot; </a>June 21, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FMKRDJutn8&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=et&amp;utm_content=lying&amp;utm_campaign=1851650_285487_Tommy%20Thompson%20for%20Senate\">Thompson campaign ad, &quot;Lying,&quot; </a>Oct. 8, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://althouse.blogspot.com/2012/07/tommy-thompson-coming-at-you-on-his.html\">Thompson campaign ad, &quot;Repeal&quot;,</a>July 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEmails, John Kraus, Baldwin campaign, Oct. 8, 9, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEmails, Brian Nemoir, Thompson campaign, Oct. 5, 8, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTommy Thompson appearance, Milwaukee Press Club, Oct. 5, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/173221301.html\">&quot;Negative attacks fill airwaves in Thompson-Baldwin race,&quot;</a>Oct. 9, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "Tommy", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 14, "last_name": "Thompson", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "tommy-thompson", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-tommythompson.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/14/", "total_count": 29, "true_count": 3, "website": "https://www.tommyforwisconsin.com/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=2&gclid=CPiG95D88qwCFUJjTAodElamlg"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays opponent Tammy Baldwin &lsquo;has had not one positive ad&rsquo; in the campaign for U.S. Senate.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Milwaukee Press Club appearance", "statement_date": "2012-10-05", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 165, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/165/", "subject": "Negative Campaigning", "subject_slug": "campaign-advertising", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "U.S. Representative", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "Tammy", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 1410, "last_name": "Baldwin", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "tammy-baldwin", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PFACT_Tammy_Baldwin.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1410/", "total_count": 49, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://www.baldwin.senate.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
