Romney acknowledged that he voted for Tsongas in the 1992 presidential primary; he could have voted in the Republican primary instead.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this fact-check, we will focus on whether Romney gave money to Democrats running for Congress in 1992.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe emailed Romney spokespersons and did not get a response. But we found plenty of news articles and data that related to Gingrich&rsquo;s claim.</b><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Romney mostly donated to Republicans</b><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b style=\"font-weight: normal\">When we searched the Federal Election Commission website we found Romney donations only going back to 1997. At our request, the FEC <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/tampabay.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoEP9bzAFvYedHczSE9EdmVrYUlkblFwcnRHc29ReVE#gid=0\">ran a report</a> for us that included donations from 1998 back to 1988.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat data showed three donations to Democrats in 1992: $1,000 to Douglas Anderson, $250 to John LaFalce and $250 to Richard Swett. (More on these candidates in a bit.) That information was in line with what the Gingrich campaign provided us, as well as election contributions gathered by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe couldn&rsquo;t help but notice, however, that during the past 20 years the bulk of donations made by Romney were to Republican candidates or committees. We found the easiest way to search his donations was by looking at the Center for Responsive Politics&rsquo; <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/indivs/search.php?name=romney%2C+willard&amp;state=&amp;zip=&amp;employ=&amp;cand=&amp;old=Y&amp;sort=N&amp;capcode=4x3hb&amp;submit=Submit+your+Donor+Query\">Open Secrets</a> website -- searching both by Mitt Romney and his actual first name, Willard Romney.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSearching this way, we found donations to about 23 individuals, and only three were Democrats. Sometimes Romney gave to the same individual more than once so ultimately there were far more than two dozen donations to candidates. Romney also gave thousands to state and national Republican committees. Interestingly, he also made donations to one of his current rivals for the Republican nomination -- Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. </b><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>What the three Democrats said about Romney</b><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Even though the donations to Democrats were exceptions to the rule, let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the three Democratic candidates:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t</b>&bull;<b style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> <a href=\"http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=S001113\">U.
