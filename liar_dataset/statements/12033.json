So before you promise your vote to Hillary, don&rsquo;t you deserve to know what she promised them?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most common critiques of Clinton is her connection to Wall Street &mdash; though usually from her Democratic opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders &mdash; so we decided to head to the Truth-O-Meter with the ad&rsquo;s claim that Clinton gave speeches to banks &quot;who paid her over $1 million and are contributing millions more to elect her.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgave2.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00574533\">Future45</a> has taken in hundreds of thousands of dollars from individuals in the financial industry &mdash; including a $250,000 donation from Kenneth Griffin, CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and another $250,000 from Paul Singer, founder of hedge fund Elliott Associates. The PAC has spent more than $600,000 against Clinton so far this cycle, according to the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/indexpend.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00574533\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>&rsquo; OpenSecrets website. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Speaking fees</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has delivered several dozen paid speeches for various corporations, professional associations and financial institutions since she left the State Department in 2013, making upwards of $200,000 for nearly every appearance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/tax-returns/\">records released by her campaign</a>, we found that she made nearly $4 million speaking to financial services firms. She earned about half of that money speaking to big Wall Street banks like Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, UBS, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs, where she spoke three times in 2013, each appearance raking in $225,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t have many details regarding what Clinton talked about in those speeches. As the Future45 ad points out, she has declined to release transcripts until other candidates release transcripts from their own paid speeches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, she has earned several million dollars in speaking fees from banks. Now on to her campaign contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Campaign contributions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s campaign and outside groups working on her behalf have received millions of dollars from Wall Street, $23.5 million to be exact, according to her <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/indus.php?cycle=2016&amp;id=N00000019&amp;type=f\">OpenSecrets file</a>. (If you&rsquo;re browsing the file yourself, we combined donations from securities and investment with miscellaneous finance.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In total, almost $190 million has been raised to support her election, so the amount coming from the financial sector accounts for about 12 percent of all campaign and outside group funds. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of that money goes to outside groups working on Clinton&rsquo;s behalf. <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/contrib.php?id=N00000019&amp;cycle=2016&amp;type=f&amp;src=o\">The top-five&nbsp;organizations</a> contributing to those groups are in the financial sector: Soros Fund Management ($7 million), Euclidian Capital ($3.5 million), Pritzker Group ($2.8 million), Paloma Partners ($2.5 million)&nbsp;and Saban Capital Group ($2.5 million).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/include/contribmethod_pop.php\">To be clear:</a> The money doesn&rsquo;t come from the firms themselves. Rather it comes from individual employees or members of the organizations, or the organizations&rsquo; political action committees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Future45 ad, though, makes it seem like the big banks that paid Clinton for speeches are the same ones that are donating millions to elect her. Not so, at least not yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OpenSecrets ran some numbers for us and found that donors from these five big Wall Street banks &mdash; Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, UBS, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs &mdash; have contributed a combined $628,435 to her campaign and allied outside groups so far. That&rsquo;s far less than &quot;millions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has received more money from the financial sector than any of the remaining candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:720px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Candidate</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Total money raised (campaign and outside groups)</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Total money raised from the financial sector</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?id=N00000019\">Clinton</a></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$188,192,044</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$23,550,697</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?cycle=2016&amp;id=N00000528&amp;type=f\">Sanders</a></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$96,356,657</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$125,665</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?cycle=2016&amp;id=N00033085&amp;type=f\">Sen.
