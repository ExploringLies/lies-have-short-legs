Scott Walker, both Republicans, for their lack of truthfulness. But in the process, she distorted some facts of her own.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Politifact listed Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin as the Governor who told the most lies,&quot; Weinberg wrote. &quot;Well not to be [outdone], our own &lsquo;untruthful&rsquo; Governor Chris Christie made it into Politifact&#39;s top five of &lsquo;Lie - en Governors.&rsquo; We&rsquo;re so proud Mr. Christie. &nbsp;You should really put that accolade right under your &lsquo;Jersey Comeback&rsquo; banner.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis claim surprised us: PolitiFact New Jersey never compiled such a list -- and neither did any of our fact-checking colleagues.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what is Weinberg talking about?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state senator&rsquo;s statement was based on a list posted on the liberal blog Uppity Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe list ranked governors fact-checked at least five times by PolitiFact by the percentage of True and Mostly True ratings they received.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker had the lowest combined percentage of those two rulings, according to the June 1 blog post. The post concluded that &quot;Walker is the #1 most dishonest governor in America.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie took fourth place among the &quot;top five most dishonest governors in America&quot; with 38 percent of his PolitiFact rulings earning True or Mostly True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe blog&rsquo;s tally of percentages of True and Mostly True rulings for governors in its top five list was mostly accurate at the time, but there&rsquo;s several problems with the conclusions made from that data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Editor Bill Adair called suggestions that a governor is &quot;in the top five&quot; for falsehoods &quot;inaccurate -- and meaningless.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOverall, PolitiFact has checked 22 sitting governors. Only 10 of those governors have faced the Truth-O-Meter at least five times.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a pool of 10, it&rsquo;s not difficult to land a spot in the top five.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s fine if people want to use our report cards to compare the records of people we fact-check. But it&#39;s important to be accurate about what those report cards say and what they don&#39;t,&quot; Adair said. &quot;The report cards provide a tally of the claims we chose to check. But it&#39;s not accurate to say the report cards indicate who &lsquo;told the most lies.&rsquo; We are journalists who choose our fact-checks based on what is newsworthy. We are not social scientists and are not using any kind of random sample to select statements to check.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJason Butkowski, a spokesman for the New Jersey Senate Democrats, acknowledged Weinberg erred in citing PolitiFact as the source of the ranking, but, he said in an e-mail, &quot;that does not take away from the larger issue &ndash; that Governor Christie, who prides himself on his straight-talking Jersey guy demeanor, only scored truthful or mostly truthful an abysmal 38% of the time in the 37 statements analyzed by PolitiFact.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObviously, PolitiFact doesn&rsquo;t track every statement, nor do they track every Governor on an even playing field, so issuing any kind of quantitative ranking of public officials based on PolitiFact&rsquo;s information doesn&rsquo;t work. &nbsp;However, the people of New Jersey can, and should, expect more from Governor Christie when it comes to leveling with them on the big issues that matter most to our State.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWeinberg claimed PolitiFact listed Walker as the governor &quot;who told the most lies&quot; and Christie made it into PolitiFact&rsquo;s &quot;top five of &lsquo;Lie - en Governors&rsquo;.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWeinberg is wrong on both counts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact never ranked governors by their falsehoods.
