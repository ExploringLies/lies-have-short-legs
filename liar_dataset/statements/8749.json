Bill Young&rsquo;s House seat, Kathleen Peters is clarifying her platform and trumpeting her achievements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What can one mother and grandmother from Pinellas do to stop gridlock and fix Washington?&quot; asked Peters in a mailer we received on Jan. 8. Her answer: &quot;Lower taxes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When I was Mayor of South Pasadena, we actually reduced the property taxes we collected,&quot; the flier read. It then added, &quot;In fact, my city had the third lowest property tax rate of the 24 cities in Pinellas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talking about reducing taxes is a surefire way for a candidate to get voters to pay attention, but the wording seemed curious to us. Can Peters take credit for South Pasadena&rsquo;s lower tax collections? It&rsquo;s time for an audit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A taxing campaign</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peters served as mayor of South Pasadena from 2008 to 2012, when she left before the end of her term to become a state representative. Before that, she was on the South Pasadena Planning and Zoning Board for two years, serving on the Charter Review Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Property taxes are a subject Peters knows well. During her state House run, Democratic opponent Josh Shulman brought up the fact that she had a history of being late paying the taxes on her former St. Pete Beach business, Captain&rsquo;s Convenience Mart. Records show she paid <a href=\"https://www.pinellas.county-taxes.com/public/tangible/parcels/T73522/bills\"><u>almost $900 in late fees and penalties</u></a> between 2000 and 2007. She also was late paying the property taxes on her house in <a href=\"https://www.pinellas.county-taxes.com/public/real_estate/parcels/R349860/bills/3502426\"><u>2007</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.pinellas.county-taxes.com/public/real_estate/parcels/R349860/bills/6772865\"><u>2012</u></a>, drawing just more than $200 in fees and penalties. Her campaign has noted there was never a lien on the properties, however, and all taxes and fines were paid within the calendar year they were due.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She&rsquo;s arguing that her city of about 5,000 took in less than before she was mayor, though. A review of South Pasadena&rsquo;s annual financial reports provided the amount of property taxes the city collected during Peters&#39; tenure. Per year, collections totaled:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2009:</strong> $790,739</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2010:</strong> $782,473</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2011:</strong> $717,208</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2012:</strong> $694,645</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that these years coincided with the Great Recession and the subsequent recovery, which brought down property values across the state following the housing bust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collections in 2009 actually went up slightly from the prior year, from $789,282 to $790,739, but the reason isn&rsquo;t because property values increased. The City Commission in fiscal year 2009 actually raised South Pasadena&rsquo;s millage rate (dollars per thousand) to 1.4886 from the previous year&rsquo;s rate of 1.2749 mills. The financial report says 2009 taxable property values were almost $91 million lower than 2008, down from $639.4 million to $548.6 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2010, the city&rsquo;s millage rate went up again, to 1.6985 mills (that was the third-lowest rate in the county, behind North Redington Beach and Belleair Shore). Taxable property values fell another $73 million that fiscal year, to $475.6 million. The millage rate stayed at that level for 2011 and 2012, but taxable property values continued to fall, down to $437.2 million in 2011 and $424.2 million in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of her term as mayor, Peters had overseen a significant decrease in property tax collections, to the tune of just more than $96,000 per year. The City Commission had actually increased the millage rate during her time, however, and she was mayor during a time taxable property values fell more than $215 million from 2008 levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, taxes fell because property values fell, not because of any specific action Peters took.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peters attempted to tout her record on property taxes, saying in her mailer that as mayor of South Pasadena &quot;we actually reduced the property taxes we collected.&quot; As a campaign promise, that implies she had a part in lowering taxes in her city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we looked at the city&rsquo;s annual financial reports, we found she actually presided over an increase in the millage rate, and tax collections fell because of a drastic reduction in taxable property values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-01-10T11:23:57.371433", "ruling_date": "2014-01-10T14:04:13", "ruling_headline": "Kathleen Peters says South Pasadena 'reduced the amount of taxes we collected' while she was mayor", "ruling_headline_slug": "kathleen-peters-says-south-pasadena-reduced-amount", "ruling_link_text": "Only because property values cratered", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Campaign mailer, &quot;What can one mother and grandmother from Pinellas do to stop gridlock and fix Washington?,&quot; received Jan. 8, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campaign mailer (2012), &quot;As the Mayor of South Pasadena, Kathleen Peters has proven how to make government work in tight economic times without raising taxes!,&quot; accessed Jan. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://174.129.77.10/news/politics/bios-for-beach-south-pasadena-races-fire-fee-details/414007\"><u>Bios for beach, South Pasadena races; fire fee details</u></a>,&quot; March 8, 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hill, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/193128-gop-house-hopeful-has-history-of-late-tax-payments\"><u>GOP House hopeful has history of late tax payments</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 13, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Political Hurricane, &quot;<a href=\"http://thepoliticalhurricane.com/2012/10/06/hd-69-race-turning-nasty-effective-fdp-mailerstv-ads/\"><u>HD-69 Race Turning Nasty; Effective FDP Mailers/TV Ads</u></a>,&quot; Oct. 6, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pinellas County Tax Collector, <a href=\"https://www.pinellas.county-taxes.com/public/tangible/parcels/T73522/bills\"><u>Bill History for 6880 Gulf Blvd</u></a>, accessed Jan. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pinellas County Tax Collector, <a href=\"https://www.pinellas.county-taxes.com/public/real_estate/parcels/R349860/bills/3502426\"><u>Real Estate 2007 Annual Bill</u></a>, accessed Jan. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pinellas County Tax Collector, <a href=\"https://www.pinellas.county-taxes.com/public/real_estate/parcels/R349860/bills/6772865\"><u>Real Estate 2012 Annual Bill</u></a>, accessed Jan. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pinellas County Tax Collector, <a href=\"http://198.20.177.40/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2012-Millage-Sheet.pdf\"><u>Millage rates levied for 2012 taxes</u></a>, accessed Jan. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>City of South Pasadena, <a href=\"http://www.myflorida.com/audgen/pages/mun_efile%20rpts/2009%20south%20pasadena.pdf\"><u>2009 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,</u></a> accessed Jan. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>City of South Pasadena, <a href=\"http://www.myflorida.com/audgen/pages/mun_efile%20rpts/2010%20south%20pasadena.pdf\"><u>2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,</u></a> accessed Jan. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>City of South Pasadena, <a href=\"http://www.myflorida.com/audgen/pages/mun_efile%20rpts/2011%20south%20pasadena.pdf\"><u>2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,</u></a> accessed Jan. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>City of South Pasadena, <a href=\"http://www.myflorida.com/audgen/pages/mun_efile%20rpts/2011%20south%20pasadena.pdf\"><u>2012 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,</u></a> accessed Jan. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Mark Zubaly, Kathleen Peters campaign consultant, Jan. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Gerald Schuster, South Pasadena assistant finance director, Jan. 10, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "District 69 state representative", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Kathleen", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 2560, "last_name": "Peters", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "kathleen-peters", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/kathleenpeters.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2560/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.kathleenpeters.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;When I was Mayor of South Pasadena, we actually reduced the property taxes we collected.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign mailer", "statement_date": "2014-01-08", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
