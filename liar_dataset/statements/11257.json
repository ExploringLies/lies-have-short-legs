Also running is Glen Sturtevant, a Republican who serves on the Richmond School Board; Marleen Durfee, an independent who is a former Chesterfield supervisor; and Carl Loser, a Libertarian from Powhatan County.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gecker, in his comment, was referring to universal coverage, in which all citizens get national help in paying for health costs. We wondered if he was right about about the United States&rsquo; exceptional status among the wealthiest nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gecker pointed us to a report last year issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 nations -- mostly with industrialized economies -- seeking to improve trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/soc_glance-2014-en/06/05/index.html?contentType=%2fns%2fChapter%2c%2fns%2fStatisticalPublication&amp;itemId=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2fsoc_glance-2014-26-en&amp;mimeType=text%2fhtml&amp;containerItemId=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f19991290&amp;accessItemIds=\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>report</u></a> says only two OECD countries -- the U.S. and Mexico -- do not offer universal care.

Gecker also directed us to the World Bank&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD/countries/1W?order=wbapi_data_value_2014%20wbapi_data_value%20wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=desc&amp;display=default\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>ranking</u></a> of the wealthiest nations based on each country&rsquo;s gross domestic product divided by its population -- a figure called GDP per capita. About two-thirds of the nations on the World Bank&rsquo;s 25-richest list belong to the OECD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sought to compare that ranking with a list of all nations that provide universal health care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found two organizations that try to keep tabs on nations that provide universal coverage. One is the New York State Department of Health, which compiled a 2011 <a href=\"http://www.health.ny.gov/regulations/hcra/univ_hlth_care.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>list</u></a> to give medical providers guidance on billing practices when they treat foreign patients. The other resource is a 2010 <a href=\"http://www.pacifichealthsummit.org/downloads/UHC/the%20political%20economy%20of%20uhc.PDF\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>study</u></a> by researchers in the United Kingdom and the U.S. examining universal health care around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among high GDP-per-capita nations, universal care coverage is the norm. Only three of the 25 wealthiest -- the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Qatar -- weren&rsquo;t listed as having universal health care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The embassy for Qatar told us that the country does provide universal health care. Saudi Arabia is listed as providing universal health care in a June 28, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/06/heres-a-map-of-the-countries-that-provide-universal-health-care-americas-still-not-on-it/259153/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>story</u></a> from The Atlantic magazine. We reached out to the Saudi Arabian embassy several times to confirm that&rsquo;s the case, but did not hear back. A 1998 <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3437117/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>study </u></a>published in the Journal of Family Community Medicine says &quot;Saudi Arabian policy is to provide free, comprehensive and universal health care services to all citizens.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final source Gecker cited is a 2012 op-ed by David de Ferranti, former vice president of the World Bank, and Julio Frenk, the former dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, about universal health care coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Except for the United States, the 25 wealthiest nations have some form of it (universal coverage),&quot; de Ferranti and Frenk <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/06/opinion/toward-universal-health-coverage.html?_r=3\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>wrote</u></a> in their op-ed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We got a similar take from two other health care analysts we contacted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andrea Feigl, a visiting scientist at Harvard who co-wrote the 2010 U.K.-U.S. report,&nbsp;told us in an email that &quot;The United States is still on its way towards UHC (Universal Health Coverage), and it is the last developed country to do so.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The World Health Organization said in a September 2014 <a href=\"http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/92/12/14-141762.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>report </u></a>that the United States is &quot;currently the only high-income country without nearly universal health-care coverage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gecker said that &quot;of the 25 wealthiest nations, we&rsquo;re the only one that doesn&rsquo;t provide basic health coverage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gecker was referring to rich nations that provide coverage to all of their citizens. We can&rsquo;t say definitively that the U.S. is the only one that doesn&rsquo;t provide universal coverage, but evidence strongly points that way.
