Charlie Crist, now a Democrat and a 2014 candidate for governor, <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/charlie-crist-thank-you-senator-rubio-for-your-endorsement-of-the-new/2156929\"><u>wrote an op-ed</u></a> thanking U.S.<strong> </strong>Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a one-time Senate race opponent of his.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sound nice? It isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a thinly veiled dig at Rubio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Senator Marco Rubio&rsquo;s endorsement of Obamacare for his own family should end the rhetoric coming from Governor Rick Scott and other tea party groups,&quot; Crist wrote, adding, &quot;The rollout of the Affordable Health Care Act has clearly been flawed, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that our work towards affordable health care should end. It should continue.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to sort through the rhetoric and clarify Rubio&rsquo;s stance on President Barack Obama&rsquo;s signature health care law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First things first: Rubio <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/rubio-enrolls-in-obamacare-takes-federal-subsidy/2156529\"><u>did purchase insurance</u></a> for his family on the Washington&nbsp;marketplace. Rubio and others are signing up for insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces to comply with the law&rsquo;s individual mandate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal lawmakers <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/14/ted-cruz/sen-ted-cruz-says-obama-just-granted-all-congress-/\"><u>will stop getting government-provided coverage.</u></a> Instead, they&rsquo;ll purchase insurance alongside small businesses and the uninsured. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced that rule in an amendment to the law so that legislators would see firsthand what average Americans would experience on the marketplaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal legislators make up the only group of people to get kicked off employer-provided insurance. When they sign up on the marketplaces, they&rsquo;ll get a subsidy that covers up to 75 percent of their premium costs. That subsidy they get is similar to<strong> </strong>the deal many Americans get through employer-provided benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of Rubio&rsquo;s fellow Republicans have refused the federal subsidy, or refused insurance on the marketplaces altogether in favor of choosing a policy directly through a private insurer. Crist is highlighting that Rubio didn&rsquo;t do the same. But does taking the subsidy mean&nbsp;Rubio endorsed Obamacare for his family?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crist&rsquo;s spokesman offered us one <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/endorse\"><u>Merriam-Webster definition</u></a> of &quot;endorse&quot; to support<strong> </strong>his point: &quot;to publicly say that you like or use (a product or service) in exchange for money.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s another definition that applies here, one that&rsquo;s at least equally common: &quot;to publicly or officially say that you support or approve of (someone or something).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio is publicly saying he&rsquo;s using a product, but it&rsquo;s not quite right to say it&rsquo;s in exchange for money. The money is awarded to any U.S. legislator who buys insurance on the exchanges, whether or not they make that decision public. He&rsquo;s getting the money because that&rsquo;s what the law stipulates, not because he&rsquo;s promoting Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that second definition of &quot;endorse&quot; rings false. Rubio has been vocal in his criticism of Obamacare, as Crist&rsquo;s column itself acknowledges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Senator Rubio is following the law, even though he opposes it,&quot; said Brooke Sammon, Rubio&rsquo;s spokeswoman, after the senator enrolled in Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio has even called the individual mandate a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/rubio-delay-individual-mandate-while-obamacare-website-problems-addressed/2148349\"><u>disaster</u></a>,&quot; and pushed for getting the entire law repealed and replaced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to Crist&rsquo;s column, Rubio said Monday, &quot;I don&rsquo;t endorse Obamacare. I much rather would have a vibrant private market where individuals like myself and others can buy health insurance from any company that will sell it to us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is worth repeating the <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/12/16/3822282/marco-rubio-defends-10k-subsidy.html\"><em><u>Miami Herald</u></em><u><em>&rsquo;s</em> observation</u></a>, though, that when Rubio served as Florida House speaker while Crist was governor, Rubio pushed to open an exchange that would help small businesses offer insurance. So he&rsquo;s supported that sort of concept before, even if he emphatically doesn&rsquo;t support something similar on the federal level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crist said Rubio endorsed Obamacare for his family. He did sign up for insurance on the Washington&nbsp;marketplace, but we think calling that an endorsement is too strong. Rubio certainly doesn&rsquo;t support Obamacare, and has pushed for its&nbsp;repeal. He&rsquo;s signed up through the marketplace simply to abide by the law. We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-12-18T14:29:45.724002", "ruling_date": "2013-12-18T16:55:50", "ruling_headline": "Marco Rubio endorsed Obamacare for his family, Charlie Crist says", "ruling_headline_slug": "marco-rubio-endorsed-obamacare-his-family-charlie-", "ruling_link_text": "He's just following the law", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Brooke Sammon, Marco Rubio spokeswoman, Dec. 16, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Merriam-Webster, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/endorse\"><u>endorse</u></a>,&quot; accessed Dec. 17, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Miami Herald</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/12/16/3822282/marco-rubio-defends-10k-subsidy.html\"><u>Marco Rubio defends $10K subsidy after Obamacare signup</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 16, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone and email interviews with Kevin Cate, Charlie Crist spokesman, Dec. 17, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/14/ted-cruz/sen-ted-cruz-says-obama-just-granted-all-congress-/\"><u>Sen.
