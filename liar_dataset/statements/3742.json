John Kasich touted the concept this month when he spoke to the Ohio Chamber of Commerce about making Ohio more competitive for business growth:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We&#39;re to the point now where location matters because logistics matters again,&quot; he said. &quot;Cost of shipping things matters again. We&#39;re within 600 miles of 60 percent of America. We&#39;re in a perfect location.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGiven our Buckeye bias, PolitiFact Ohio wanted to believe it. But we have examined similar claims before and found them wanting. We knew that population has shifted since the 1940s, when the population center point of the entire nation (now in Missouri) was still in Ohio. But we also noted that Kasich moved the measuring stick from 500 miles cited in those previous claims to 600 miles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing the tools we employed before, <a href=\"http://media.cleveland.com/datacentral/photo/600-miles-of-ohiojpg-95bade4b893a3bd3.jpg\">we built a map including all U.S. counties whose seats are located within 600 miles of Ohio&#39;s borders</a>. We used U.S. Census Bureau data to calculate the aggregate population.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found that 184,900,000 people live within 600 miles of Ohio, or 59.9 percent of the U.S. population of 308.7 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s 60 percent, whether you round off by a number that is not statistically significant or factor a margin of error.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe 600-mile reach would include nearly all of the Eastern Seaboard, the upper Midwest, much of the Deep South and some states west of the Mississippi River.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne additional note: In addition to 60 percent of the U.S. population, Kasich&rsquo;s claim also would encompass the most populous parts of Ontario and Quebec.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Kasich&#39;s statement as True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-12T16:43:18.928878", "ruling_date": "2011-05-13T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Gov.
