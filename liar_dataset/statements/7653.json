Advocates spend a lot of time talking about how a higher per-pack price would cut the number of youth smokers -- and the various health benefits that would come with never starting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Rep. Nancy Nathanson, D-Eugene, took a slightly different tack during a House floor speech earlier this month: Not only would an increased tax save some lungs, but if smokers quit as a result of the increase, their wallets would thank them, too.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;A pack-a-day smoker who quits because of the tax increase will save about $1,650 a year to spend on other essential household goods and services, a not insubstantial number for that family,&quot; Nathanson said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe started thinking about everything we&rsquo;d buy with that $1,600 -- some shoes, maybe, definitely a few new records, a new computer even. Then we remembered nobody at PolitiFact Oregon smokes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, we couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder if Nathanson&rsquo;s math added up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe gave her office a call and they told us the figures came from a study done by the Multnomah County Health Department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe department found that a pack ran between $4.37 to $4.97 with brands ranging from Marlboro, Lucky Strike, American Legend and Newport. That meant a pack-a-day smoker would save between $1,600 and $1,800.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNathanson&rsquo;s $1,650 figure came from the cost of L&amp;M cigarettes at WinCo, which was $4.51 a pack.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report&rsquo;s figures came from this March and April but PolitiFact Oregon likes to do a little independent research for any given claim. We set out on our own and hit up a Safeway in downtown Portland for a price survey of our own.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCigarettes at Safeway do not come cheap. A pack of Marlboros came in at $6.20 and you&rsquo;d have to fork over $8 for American Spirits. That&rsquo;d put you at a yearly savings of anywhere between $2,250 and $2,900. (We&rsquo;d buy two computers with that bonus.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were about to check on the price of a carton of cigarettes because our moms taught us to shop in bulk, when the kind woman behind the counter said we ought to just walk a block to the nearest Plaid Pantry.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere, you could get a pack for anywhere between $4.98 and $6.25. A carton of Marlboro reds came in at $50 for 10 packs, which seemed about right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ruling: Nathanson said that a pack-a-day smoker would save $1,650 a year. Her numbers were based on a report from the Multnomah County Health Department, but it turns out that&rsquo;s a pretty conservative estimate, at least for Portland.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, her point is that quitting will save a hefty chunk of change and we rate that claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-04-15T19:38:12.505900", "ruling_date": "2013-04-15T16:37:40", "ruling_headline": "Would a pack-a-day smoker save $1650 a year if they quit smoking?", "ruling_headline_slug": "would-pack-day-smoker-save-1650-year-if-they-quit-", "ruling_link_text": "Depending on where you shop you might save more", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRep.
