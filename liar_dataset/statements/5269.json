Stegmaier wants folks to know he oversees a lean government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Chesterfield has eliminated more positions from its general government operations than the Commonwealth has from the entire state government since (fiscal) 2009,&quot; Stegmaier said in an outline of a Dec. 14, 2011 speech he made to the Chesterfield Chamber of Commerce.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were struck by this statement. The state government has 33 full-time equivalent workers for every one in Chesterfield&rsquo;s central government. Is it true that the county, in raw numbers, eliminated more jobs than the much larger state?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe ran a check.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChesterfield&rsquo;s general government operations include workers in all services except education. Stegmaier said that if education was included, the numbers would only grow in Chesterfield&rsquo;s favor since the county has trimmed employment in that department as well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStegmaier, to support his claim that Chesterfield&rsquo;s central government has shed more jobs than the state, pointed us to two sets of statistics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe cited county budgets that detail Chesterfield&rsquo;s authorized full-time employment levels in general government. In fiscal 2009, there were 3,697 authorized jobs. In fiscal 2012, which ends June 30, there were 3,516 such positions. That&rsquo;s a decrease of 181 approved jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor state figures, Stegmaier relied on data from Virginia&rsquo;s Department of Planning and Budget that detail authorized employment levels for all agencies. The state lists the number of employees as &quot;full time equivalents&quot; -- a figure that lumps together full-time and part-time employees. That&rsquo;s why the overall number ends in a decimal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fiscal 2009, the state had a maximum employment level 114,724.44 jobs. This fiscal year, the maximum is set at 114,566.73.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the state&rsquo;s drop of about 157 authorized employees falls 24 short of Chesterfield&rsquo;s reduction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we had some issues with Stegmaier&rsquo;s proof. He had not made an apples-to-apples comparison because Chesterfield only tallied full-time employees while the state counted full-timers and part-timers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, the state and county numbers Stegmaier compared are maximum employment levels in budgets. Not all of those jobs were filled.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe think the acid test for Stegmaier&rsquo;s statement is measuring the change in the number of people who actually worked for Chesterfield County and the state. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe turned to the Virginia Department of Human Resource Management&rsquo;s website, which lists the number of state employees for any given month over the past 21 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn June 30, 2009 -- the end of fiscal 2009 -- , the state had 119,850.81 full-time equivalent employees. By Oct. 31, 2011, the latest date for which statistics were available, the number &nbsp;rose to 120,465.97. The state had gained 615.16 full-time equivalent workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen we turned to Chesterfield. Matt Harris, the county&rsquo;s senior budget analyst, told us Chesterfield had 3,816 full-time equivalent employees on July 1, 2009. The number dropped to 3,664 on Nov. 1, 2011. The county lost 152 full-time equivalent workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling:</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo matter which set of numbers you use, Chesterfield has eliminated more jobs from its general government operations than Virginia has from its entire state government since fiscal 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Stegmaier&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-27T19:22:33.946145", "ruling_date": "2012-01-29T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Stegmaier says Chesterfield County has cut more government jobs than state of Virginia ", "ruling_headline_slug": "stegmaier-says-chesterfield-county-has-cut-more-go", "ruling_link_text": "Who would have guessed?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tJames J.L.
