According to the New Jersey Department of the Treasury, taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective income tax rate of 6.88 percent, compared with 1.73 percent for people earning $100,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tO&rsquo;Scanlon told us his point was that those earning $1 million already pay their fair share. An increase in income taxes could drive people out of the state or discourage them from moving to New Jersey, O&rsquo;Scanlon said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s wonderful politics,&quot; O&rsquo;Scanlon said. &quot;It&rsquo;s lousy policy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s explain what an &quot;effective tax rate&quot; is.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey currently imposes state income tax rates ranging from 1.4 percent on income of $20,000 or less to a top rate of 8.97 percent on income of $500,001 or greater.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut those rates don&rsquo;t represent what individuals actually pay in total income taxes, because a person&rsquo;s income faces different rates as his income increases. Also, taxpayers can receive various exemptions and deductions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the &quot;effective tax rate&quot; represents the percentage of one&rsquo;s gross income that actually goes toward income taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAndrew Pratt, a Treasury Department spokesman, told us the department calculated effective tax rates for O&rsquo;Scanlon, per the following income levels:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t$100,000: 1.73 percent<br />\r\n\t$1 million: 6.88 percent<br />\r\n\t$5 million: 8.5 percent<br />\r\n\t$10 million: 8.72 percent<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBased on those numbers, someone earning $1 million is paying $68,800 in state income taxes, compared to $1,730 for taxpayers earning $100,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor individuals with smaller incomes, the effective tax rate is even less. Taxpayers earning between $20,001 and $50,000 pay an effective tax rate of 0.7 percent, according to the state Treasury department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPratt also noted how higher-income earners represent a small percentage of taxpayers, but provide a significant portion of the tax revenue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Notice that income over $500,000 represents an infinitesimal 0.2 percent of taxpayers, yet brings in 34.1 percent of tax revenue,&quot; Pratt said in an email. &quot;Throw in the rest of the top 1 percent of taxpayers, and you get 37 percent of total tax collections.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRoberton Williams, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, told us an effective tax rate is the &quot;appropriate measure to assess tax burden.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That&#39;s the share of income going to taxes. A person&#39;s effective tax rate equals her tax liability divided by her pretax income,&quot; Williams said in an email. &quot;Thus a person making $100,000 and paying a total of $15,000 in tax(es) faces an effective tax rate of 15%.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an opinion piece in the Star-Ledger, O&rsquo;Scanlon wrote: &quot;Taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective tax rate that is about four times what taxpayers earning $100,000 pay.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBased on data from the state Treasury department, O&rsquo;Scanlon is correct.
