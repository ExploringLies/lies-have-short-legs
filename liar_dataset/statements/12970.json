Reynolds. Its campaign says online and in radio ads that the measure &quot;cheats schools out of at least $600 million a year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The industry attacks are not surprising. And they&rsquo;ll likely continue as opponents of the measure have raised more than $35 million, while supporters have collected about $17 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether there&rsquo;s any truth to the claim that Prop 56 &lsquo;cheats&rsquo; schools out of all that money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly three decades ago, voters in California approved Proposition 98 requiring a minimum level of funding for public education. It requires the state to dedicate roughly 40 percent of new General Fund revenues to K-12 schools and community colleges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prop 56 would generate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://webmail.saclink.csus.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=ClAjxrMIwQe8WxH54i_4M7eYH-JUAZNmACxYKKFwwn6FabWCMM3TCA..&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lao.ca.gov%2fballot%2f2016%2fProp56-110816.pdf\">up to $1.4 billion</a> in tax revenue its first year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But instead of sending that revenue to the General Fund, Prop 56 would place it in a special fund to help pay for Medi-Cal, which provides health coverage for millions of low-income Californians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the No on 56 campaign for evidence that the tobacco tax measure &lsquo;cheats&rsquo; schools. A spokeswoman pointed to language in the measure that exempts Prop 56 from the school funding guarantee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The campaign said this exemption is proof that the measure undermines the funding guarantee and &lsquo;cheats&rsquo; schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the experts we spoke with say there&rsquo;s nothing new about this proposal. Past tobacco taxes, in 1988 and 1998, also established special funds rather than sending money to the General Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the experts said the opponents&rsquo; claim is misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When I think of this claim that the schools are going to be cheated -- particularly that word &lsquo;cheated&rsquo; out of this money -- that suggests something that&rsquo;s wrong or illegal. And this is not the case,&quot; said Steve Boilard, executive director of Sacramento State University&rsquo;s Center for California Studies. &quot;There&rsquo;s plenty of examples where new revenue is raised that is not subject to the Prop 98 funding guarantee.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boilard pointed to Proposition 63, a tax on wealthy Californians that funds mental health services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/6411957/CigarettesP.jpg\" style=\"height:600px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Curran Kelleher / Flickr</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Others reject claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson rejected the claim that the new tax measure &lsquo;cheats&rsquo; schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://webmail.saclink.csus.edu/owa/redir.aspx?C=P-ypM5oL_1y_6KjEtdLS0kDSTbn0eFKAP5KVXXoDb_GFabWCMM3TCA..&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.yeson56.org%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2016%2f08%2fTorlakson-Letter.pdf\">recent letter</a> circulated by the Yes on 56 campaign, he wrote: &quot;Make no mistake, Proposition 56 will not divert a dime away from schools.

Nothing in the measure reduces school funding. If the measure passes, the budget for schools does not decrease.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The No on 56 campaign is running ads that say the proposed&nbsp;tobacco tax &quot;cheats schools out of at least $600 million a year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The measure includes an exemption from the state&rsquo;s school funding&nbsp;guarantee. A portion of its revenues, estimated at up to $1.4 billion, could otherwise have been directed toward school funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But past tobacco taxes and a tax to fund mental health services have also legally avoided this guarantee. Those had exemptions allowing their revenues to fund health services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This doesn&#39;t mean, however, that money will be taken from schools or community colleges under Prop 56. The measure, in fact, sends about $20 million to schools for tobacco prevention programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim that Prop 56 &quot;cheats&quot; schools goes too far. It might have been accurate to say the measure exempts most all revenue from going to schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the term chosen by No on 56 is misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY FALSE</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>&ndash; The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\">&nbsp;more&nbsp;</a>on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/aabdc989-5155-4716-837a-cae1783eac21\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/aabdc989-5155-4716-837a-cae1783eac21</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-25T19:40:14.234847", "ruling_date": "2016-08-26T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Big Tobacco blowing smoke in claim about California's Prop 56", "ruling_headline_slug": "big-tobacco-misleads-mostly-false-claim-prop-56-ch", "ruling_link_text": "This claim is blowing smoke", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>No On 56 campaign <a href=\"http://www.noonproposition56.com/?gclid=CjwKEAjwrvq9BRD5gLyrufTqg0YSJACcuF81qY2nDrT2X3JJjwpv6OUg0t8FDEY7t0nVNQKG-IpweRoCRpzw_wcB\">website</a>, accessed August 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No On 56 campaign, <a href=\"http://millerpublicaffairsgroup.cmail19.com/t/ViewEmail/i/1BD7350E6D04E6FA/EDD836EAEA112C4320B193FBA00ED1DB\">No on 56 Launches First Radio Advertisements</a>, August 16, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes On 56 campaign <a href=\"http://www.yeson56.org/\">website</a>, accessed August 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Beth Miller, spokeswoman for No on 56 campaign, August 18, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Mike Roth, spokesman for Yes on 56 campaign, August 18, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Steve Boilard, executive director, Sacramento State University&rsquo;s Center for California Studies, August 23, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Ken Kapphahn, senior fiscal and policy analyst, Legislative Analyst&rsquo;s Office, August 25, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Torlakson, <a href=\"http://www.yeson56.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Torlakson-Letter.pdf\">letter</a> on claims by No on Prop 56, August 9, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legislative Analyst&rsquo;s Office, <a href=\"http://www.lao.ca.gov/ballot/2016/Prop56-110816.pdf\">analysis of Prop 56</a>, July 18, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sacramento Bee</em>, PoliGRAPH fact check, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article97238827.html\">Tobacco companies mislead voters in radio ad</a>,&quot; August 23, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "No on 56 ", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3662, "last_name": "campaign ", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "no-56-campaign", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-mugs-politifact-mugs-politifact-mugs-PolitiFact_silhouettes_19.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "California", "edition": "California", "edition_slug": "california", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 49, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The California Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/49/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3662/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Prop 56 cheats schools out of at least $600 million.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "radio and online advertisements", "statement_date": "2016-08-16", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 202, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/202/", "subject": "Public Health", "subject_slug": "public-health", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Big Tobacco misleads with Mostly False claim Prop 56 \u2018cheats\u2019 CA schools out of $600M"}
