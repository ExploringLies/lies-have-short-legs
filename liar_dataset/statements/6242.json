Chris Christie didn&rsquo;t get everything he had proposed from a tenure reform bill the state Legislature passed recently. But the Republican governor told a national audience this week teachers will lose tenure after receiving negative evaluations, one element of his education reform plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;d be a win for the governor, if it were true.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it&rsquo;s not that simple.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie said after the New Jersey Education Association, the state&rsquo;s largest teachers union, spent two years campaigning against his tenure reform proposals, they finally &quot;came to the table. And we negotiated New Jersey&#39;s tenure law, which is over 100 years old, the oldest tenure law for K to 12 education in the country, has now been reformed to say that if teachers get two years of partially effective or ineffective ratings they lose tenure,&quot; Christie said during a July 9 speech at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. &quot;We&#39;re putting accountability back into the system.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey found teachers who receive negative evaluations may be fired, but under the legislation -- passed by both houses of the Legislature on June 25 but not yet signed by the governor -- teachers still have the right to appeal, the core job protection afforded by tenure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie has described tenure as a job for life, but a process through which districts can fire teachers has always existed. Critics, however, argue the system is so costly and time-consuming that it deters districts from using it except in extreme cases of misconduct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState law says tenured teachers cannot have their pay reduced or be fired except for inefficiency, incapacity, unbecoming conduct or other just cause, and then only after a hearing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat does not change with the new legislation. Tenure charges are still subject to a hearing, though the process has been overhauled in an effort to make it easier to dismiss teachers. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMichael Drewniak, a spokesman for Christie, said the governor &quot;did not go into full detail and, for the sake of brevity in a speech, merely abbreviated the process which clears the way for revocation of tenure.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This is a sea change in the law,&quot; Drewniak said. &quot;Prior to the tenure bill, teachers could be removed for only a handful of reasons in a process that was massively expensive for school districts and ridiculously time consuming. For the first time, there is a statewide evaluation system that can be used to remove poor-performing teachers through a more streamlined process.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe legislation creates an evaluation system with four possible ratings: ineffective, partially effective, effective and highly effective.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSuperintendents will be required to file a charge of inefficiency against a teacher who receives either two consecutive ineffective ratings or a partially effective rating and then an ineffective rating the next year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSuperintendents, under exceptional circumstances, may defer filing tenure charges for a year against a teacher who receives two consecutive partially effective ratings or an ineffective rating and then a partially effective rating the next year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the charges must be filed if the teacher does not receive a positive evaluation the next year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, tenured teachers facing a charge of inefficiency maintain the right to dispute those charges with a third-party, though the process has been changed. For instance, arbitrators, rather than administrative law judges, will now hear cases involving tenure charges.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe can&rsquo;t know now whether that process will definitely make firing inefficient teachers easier, but what is clear is that tenure isn&rsquo;t immediately revoked after two negative evaluations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie said New Jersey&rsquo;s teacher tenure law &quot;has now been reformed to say that if teachers get two years of partially effective or ineffective ratings they lose tenure.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor the large part, superintendents must file tenure charges against teachers who receive two consecutive negative ratings on annual evaluations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn those cases, teachers may ultimately be fired, but they don&rsquo;t automatically lose their tenure and, therefore, maintain the right to appeal the charges levied against them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/07/chris_christie_teacher_tenure.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-11T10:18:22.141911", "ruling_date": "2012-07-12T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie says under new bill teachers who receive two negative evaluations lose tenure", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-says-state-reformed-its-tenure-law-", "ruling_link_text": "Expedites process, doesn't eliminate it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBrookings Institution, <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/events/2012/07/09-christie-fiscal-integrity\">Restoring Fiscal Integrity and Accountability: A Discussion with Governor Chris Christie (R-NJ)</a>, July 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/09/stephen-sweeney/steve-sweeney-claims-new-legislation-doesnt-elimin/\">Steve Sweeney claims new legislation doesn&rsquo;t eliminate teacher tenure</a>, July 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Michael Drewniak, spokesman for <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/governor/\">Gov.
