Despite the well-publicized woes, however, state officials say they are making progress toward getting people enrolled in time to avoid federal penalties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of which makes Cover Oregon a prime target for critics who say the state&rsquo;s new health-insurance marketplace is too expensive, too intrusive and too restrictive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., took a shot at Cover Oregon in his new &quot;Wastebook 2013&quot; -- a comic-book-style tome he puts out each year highlighting what he calls 100 examples of wasted taxpayer dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter Nine, &quot;Millions Spent Building, Promoting an Insurance Plan Few Want and a Website that Doesn&rsquo;t Work,&quot; said this: &quot;Oregon is spending $10 million advertising Obamacare with advertisements that don&rsquo;t even mention the program or how to enroll in it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He singles out two television ads, both produced for Cover Oregon by NORTH, a Portland advertising agency. One spot, Coburn said, &quot;does not mention the word &lsquo;insurance,&rsquo; &quot; while another, he added, &quot;does not mention the word &lsquo;insurance,&rsquo; but features what appears to be Gumby riding on the Beatles&rsquo; yellow submarine.&quot; The implication is that the state spent a ton of money on ads that may have been clever but not direct or effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Cover Oregon spend $10 million for television ads that didn&rsquo;t mention the word &lsquo;insurance&rsquo;? PolitiFact Oregon checked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The many assertions in &quot;Wastebook 2013&quot; are heavily footnoted, so we checked there first to see which sources Coburn relied on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first footnote for the Cover Oregon claim took us to a July 28, 2013, cbsnews.com story, which reported that Cover Oregon&rsquo;s new ad campaign cost $10 million. The second footnote linked directly to one of the Cover Oregon ads, &quot;Fly With Your Own Wings,&quot; a 31-second animated ad that opens and closes with the words &quot;Cover Oregon.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The television ad included a pleasantly peppy song but never used the word &quot;insurance.&quot; So on that score, at least, Coburn&rsquo;s claim appears to be on the mark. Still, wondering about context, we called Mark Ray, the NORTH principal and creative director who produced the ads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spots Coburn focuses on in his &quot;Wastebook,&quot; Ray said, were the very first ads produced to market Cover Oregon. They were intended to raise general awareness about the program rather than rain down nuts-and-bolts specifics, he said. Details on how and where to enroll were included in subsequent spots. This is a common strategy for rolling out brand-new programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He&rsquo;s cherry-picking something he doesn&rsquo;t understand,&quot; Ray said of Coburn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Ray&rsquo;s view, the campaign has been a smashing success. The 7 percent public awareness of Cover Oregon in May, he said, had soared to 78 percent in September, based on follow-up polling. &quot;Those are the best results I&rsquo;ve had in my career,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we have disagreement on omission of the word &quot;insurance&quot; in Cover Oregon&rsquo;s first advertisements. Coburn is correct that it&rsquo;s not there. But Ray adds important context in noting that the ads were early and part of a campaign designed to morph from general to specific. Newer ads, available on Cover Oregon&rsquo;s YouTube page, provide details of how and where to enroll, and nearly all use the word &quot;insurance.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That still leaves the $10 million figure cited in Coburn&rsquo;s &quot;Wastebook.&quot; Wanting to know exactly what the figure, in the senator&rsquo;s view, represented, we contacted John Hart, Coburn&rsquo;s communications manager. He spoke only of Cover Oregon&rsquo;s initial television ads. In an email, he wrote, &quot;If the state of Oregon or local communities like Portland want to fund these ads we would applaud their effort to make their state a haven for indie rockers or lumberjacks without insurance, as the ad melodically suggests.&quot; Neither he nor &quot;Wastebook 2013&quot; addressed any other elements of the marketing campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then called Michael Cox, Cover Oregon&rsquo;s communications director. He said the ads singled out in the &quot;Wastebook&quot; actually cost $3.5 million to produce and air. The $10 million figure, he said, came from a news report cited in the &quot;Wastebook&quot; footnotes that mistakenly conflated the total costs of the campaign&rsquo;s first phase -- which included Spanish-language spots, information fliers and fact sheets -- with the costs of the TV ads Coburn spotlighted. Even then, he said, the total costs of the first phase were $8.3 million, not $10 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We called Coburn&rsquo;s office again and asked Hart about the figures provided by Cox. &quot;We didn&rsquo;t claim they&rsquo;ve spent $10 million,&quot; Hart said. &quot;That was the amount budgeted. If they&rsquo;ve spent less, that&rsquo;s terrific.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We glanced back at &quot;Wastebook 2013,&quot; which leads its Cover Oregon claim by saying, &quot;Oregon is spending $10 million advertising Obamacare&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cover Oregon has not spent $10 million on the ads Coburn singles out in his &quot;Wastebook 2013.&quot; A budget passed along by Cox puts the figure at $3.5 million. A Coburn spokesman brushed aside the difference by saying his office never said that $10 million had been spent, only that it had been budgeted. The spokesman&rsquo;s own words, however, are contradicted by the senator&rsquo;s &quot;Wastebook 2013&quot; entry on Cover Oregon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Coburn&rsquo;s first claim, the Cover Oregon ads in question do not mention the word &quot;insurance.&quot; But the context in this case is vital. These were not the campaign&rsquo;s only ads, and later ads make details clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also find that the senator completely missed the mark on the amount of money spent. We rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-01-08T18:46:25.089690", "ruling_date": "2014-01-08T15:41:27", "ruling_headline": "Is Cover Oregon spending $10 million advertising Obamacare with ads that don't even mention 'insurance'?", "ruling_headline_slug": "cover-oregon-spending-10-million-advertising-obama", "ruling_link_text": "Cover Oregon has problems, but these aren't among them", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email exchange with John Hart, communications director for Sen.
