You had a number of things that were appropriate to this campaign, were part of what Mr. Trump has been talking about. ...

They also dismissed speculation of a second coup and explained that police were conducting safety inspections in preparation for a top U.S. military official&rsquo;s visit, <a href=\"http://www.stripes.com/news/more-protests-at-incirlik-as-us-turkey-tensions-ratchet-up-1.421551\">according to <em>Stars and Stripes</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-31/turkey-blocks-access-to-airbase-on-coup-suspicion-hurriyet-says\">Bloomberg</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It does appear that RT and Sputnik exaggerated their stories.

The NATO official also pointed out that Incirlik is actually not a NATO base, though U.S. and Spanish troops are stationed there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manafort said there was a &quot;NATO base in Turkey being under attack by terrorists&quot; the week Trump made his comments about &quot;Second Amendment people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian media speculated that there was a second attempted coup at Incirlik air base in Turkey. That incident was exaggerated and occurred two weeks before Trump&rsquo;s comments.&nbsp;Furthermore, though it houses NATO troops, Incirlik is not a NATO base.
