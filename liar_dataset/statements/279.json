A lot.\n<p>\n \"You know, if Ronald Reagan were running tonight, there would be ads by the Club for Growth running against him because he raised taxes a billion dollars in his first year as governor of California,\" Huckabee said. \"It would be $10-billion today.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Ronald \"Send the welfare bums back to work\" Reagan?\n</p>\n<p>\n \"Basically, yeah,\" said Kelly Barton, an archivist at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the summer of 1967, during Reagan's first year as governor, and contrary to his campaign promises, Reagan signed off on a record tax increase for the state of California &mdash; an 18 percent, roughly $1-billion hike.\n</p>\n<p>\n According to Reagan biographer Lou Cannon, the increase included boosting sales taxes from three to five cents on the dollar; raising the maximum income tax from 7 to 10 percent; and increases in bank, corporation, inheritance, liquor and cigarette taxes.\n</p>\n<p>\n A little context is in order. In his autobiography,\n <i>\n  An American Life,\n </i>\n Reagan said he inherited a $200-million deficit from his predecessor, Pat Brown. Reagan ordered a hiring freeze and other spending cuts.\n</p>\n<p>\n But Reagan was a Republican governor in a state where the legislature was controlled by the Democrats, and he wasn't able to muster support for additional cuts. So, he ended up reluctantly signing off on the tax increases.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is the second time in week that a Republican candidate has used Reagan to defend himself. In a debate on Jan. 5, 2008, Rudy Giuliani correctly pointed out that Reagan had endorsed a policy of amnesty for some illegal aliens.
