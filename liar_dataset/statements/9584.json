Gwen Moore, another Democrat from Milwaukee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I created the school choice program, which ushered in not only an era of educational reform in Wisconsin, but really throughout the nation and around the world,&quot; George, a former state senator, told newsman Mike Gousha on WISN-TV&rsquo;s &quot;Upfront&quot; show July 6, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who deserves the title of creator?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The word has <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/create?s=t\">several meanings</a>, including &quot;to cause to come into being,&quot; or &quot;evolved from one&rsquo;s own thought or imagination.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How it passed</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>George pointed us to the final amended bill that became law in 1990, when it was signed by Thompson, who was governor at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That bill allowed poor Milwaukee parents to use publicly funded vouchers to send their children to private, non-religious schools of their choosing. It was a scaled-down version of a Republican plan that sought to include religious schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To become law, the bill had to clear Joint Finance, the powerful committee that George co-chaired with Milwaukee Democrat Walter Kunicki. It was part of a multi-issue budget bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As heads of the committee, George and Kunicki were listed as authors of the bill. George brokered several changes, getting the support of Williams and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>George&rsquo;s role was &quot;crucial&quot; in winning passage, wrote <a href=\"http://www.sacredheart.edu/academics/isabellefarringtoncollegeofeducation/facultystaff/jamescarlphd/\">James Carl</a>, a scholar of urban education reform, in his book, &quot;Freedom of Choice: Vouchers in American Education.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams told PolitiFact Wisconsin the same: &quot;I give him his props. We couldn&rsquo;t have gotten that bill passed without his help.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other participants agreed. Howard Fuller, a Milwaukee Public Schools critic who went on to become superintendent, told us that &quot;if Polly had not come to an agreement with Gary, it would not have passed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So George can lay claim to a significant role in the legislation that created the choice program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s little doubt that the final product was largely drawn from an earlier bill drafted by Williams, then a state representative, and educational activist Larry Harwell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, George appears to have had little if any role in the decades-long legislative battles that came before the measure finally passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in his book, Carl flatly calls Williams &quot;the state representative who authored the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further back in history</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams and Harwell were among the varied and sometimes competing forces -- some liberal Democrats, religious leaders, conservatives, business leaders -- who began pushing in the late 1960s for choice and independent community schools in Milwaukee&rsquo;s central city. Some legislation was considered and voted on in the 1970s and into the 1980s but the partisan political obstacles were many.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decisive action, put in motion by Thompson, came during the Republican governor&rsquo;s first term in the late 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reform-minded Thompson was rebuffed in 1988 when he sought a voucher program in Milwaukee that included religious schools. George did not favor the plan and Joint Finance deleted it from the state budget, amid teachers union opposition to the governor&rsquo;s move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thompson tried again in early 1989 with a similar result, but momentum built when Milwaukee Public Schools leaders put forward their own choice plan. George&rsquo;s policy adviser, Walter Farrell, started warming to the bill, Carl recounted in his book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that point, Williams, who opposed the MPS plan, authored her own, but it fell in the state Assembly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She redrafted new legislation in mid-1989 and worked to get bipartisan support. The governor, as well as Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist, got behind it. Teachers union opposition faded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams &quot;helped persuade (George) to support their legislation,&quot; Carl wrote in his book. &quot;After meeting with community residents and Thompson, George eventually came down on Williams&rsquo; side.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Williams-authored bill easily passed the Assembly, but was bottled up in a Senate committee until George attached it to a budget bill and made changes that Williams agreed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It worked. Senate and Assembly passage followed, and Thompson signed it in April 1990, winning praise from President George H. W. Bush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In news accounts at the time, Thompson credited Williams for the plan, and George offered a cautious comment: &nbsp;&quot;We&rsquo;ll see if this is an experiment that works.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Fuller sees Williams as deserving of the most credit, despite George&rsquo;s crucial late work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>George told us: &quot;Polly Williams, she had the concept, but you have to legislate it. It&rsquo;s legislation, so there&rsquo;s no parentage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams says now she is bitter at what she sees as a misguided Republican expansion of choice beyond Milwaukee and to wealthier families in recent years. But she&rsquo;s proud of what she did and politely disagreed with George&rsquo;s comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He didn&rsquo;t create it,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thompson told PolitiFact Wisconsin he sees it this way: &quot;It was my idea, and both Williams and George had a lot to do with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>George told an interviewer: &quot;I created the school choice program.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly the former senator helped give birth to choice, steering it through the Senate with crucial changes and granting his crucial support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But George didn&rsquo;t conceive of the idea. And his account crowds out the long leadership -- and more prominent role -- of both Williams and Thompson, not to mention Williams&rsquo; authorship of the bill George modified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate, but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That fits here.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-07-11T13:12:11.851872", "ruling_date": "2014-07-13T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Gary George says he created private school choice program", "ruling_headline_slug": "gary-george-says-he-created-school-choice-program", "ruling_link_text": "Wouldn't have happened without him", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Upfront with Mike Gousha, <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/politics/upfront/George-Milwaukee-is-failing/26810344#!bclpSL\">video excerpt</a>, interview with Gary George, July 6, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Gary George, July 7, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Polly Williams, July 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Bob Lang, director, Legislative Fiscal Bureau, July 8, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Howard Fuller, July 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Tommy Thompson, July 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Choice-Vouchers-Education-Political/dp/0313393273/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404761838&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Freedom+of+Choice%3A+Vouchers+in+American+Education\">&quot;Freedom of Choice: Vouchers in American Education,</a>&quot; By Jim Carl, &nbsp;Praeger Series on Political Culture, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Archives of Milwaukee Sentinel, Milwaukee Journal, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Lawyer", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Gary", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 2858, "last_name": "George", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "gary-george", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GMTI_photoj2004q3m08t05h12173400.jff.1_1_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2858/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;I created the school choice program.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview", "statement_date": "2014-07-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "Madison school board member", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Mary", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 2452, "last_name": "Burke", "mostly_true_count": 8, "name_slug": "mary-burke", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Mary_Burke_PFACT.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2452/", "total_count": 34, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://burkeforwisconsin.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
