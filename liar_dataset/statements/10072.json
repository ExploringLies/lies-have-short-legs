Mitch McConnell in Kentucky&rsquo;s race for U.S. Senate. Grimes, now the Kentucky secretary of state, backs a Democratic effort to raise it to $10.10 an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Oct. 13 Kentucky Senate debate, McConnell, running for a sixth term in office, explained his opposition to raising the minimum wage by claiming that a Congressional Budget Office report says &quot;you will destroy between half a million and 1 million jobs (by raising the federal minimum wage).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&rsquo;s not the way to grow our economy,&quot; he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Grimes retorted that McConnell was cherry-picking data from the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The full story of the CBO report is it would help lift a million &mdash; over a million &mdash; Americans out of poverty,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked at McConnell&rsquo;s assertion in a separate fact-check and said it was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/14/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-minimum-wage-hike-would-destr/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mostly True</u></a>. The report said job losses would likely range from &quot;a very slight reduction in employment&quot; to 1 million, with a mid-range estimate of 500,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what did the CBO say about the other side the ledger, the people who would be boosted out of poverty by a minimum wage hike? We decided to take a look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Barack Obama has called on Congress to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 by 2016. In the succeeding years, increases to the minimum wage would be tied to inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are 23 states with <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-minimum-wage-chart.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>minimum wages already above the federal minimum wage</u></a>, while the remainder of the country (including Kentucky) either sets the minimum wage at $7.25, links the state minimum wage to the federal amount or specifies no minimum wage at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eight states have minimum wages set to increase to at least $10, but in most cases that would not happen until later than 2016. So this increase, if passed, would affect most of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, the federal poverty level is expected to be $24,100 for a family of four. By the CBO&rsquo;s estimate, raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would increase the net income of those living at or below the federal poverty level by $5 billion. That&rsquo;s enough to move 900,000 of approximately 45 million people living below the federal poverty level above that threshold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not quite what Grimes said. While she initially said &quot;a million Americans&quot; she quickly corrected herself to say raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would lift &quot;<em>over </em>a million Americans out of poverty.&quot; The actual figure is close to a million, but definitely not &quot;over&quot; it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grimes&rsquo; campaign told us after the debate that the candidate misspoke both times and meant to say &quot;nearly a million.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CBO estimate of 900,000 people is a net figure. That means it factors in not only the people who would move above the poverty line if the minimum wage went up to $10.10 an hour, but also those who would move below it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How would someone move below the poverty line if the minimum wage went up? As we noted earlier, the CBO estimates that somewhere between a few people and a million people could lose their jobs as a result of a minimum wage hike. Some businesses might have to cut back on employees to pay the increased wages of other workers, which could have a ripple effect on the economy resulting in about 500,000 lost jobs by the end of 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it&rsquo;s possible that more than 900,000 people would be lifted out of poverty, it&rsquo;s just that some of them are offset by people moving into poverty as a result of the increase in the minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CBO report does not say how many of the 500,000 lost jobs would move people into poverty, and it&rsquo;s presumptuous to put any number on it. If one person in a family loses a job as a result of a minimum wage hike, it doesn&rsquo;t always mean the family is now living in poverty. The lost job could be that of a teenage child or one parent in a two-income household.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And either way, the net figure &mdash; 900,000 &mdash; is the most important number that tells the full story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, Grimes is right that there&rsquo;s another side to the CBO report that McConnell&rsquo;s comments do not highlight. As the report noted: &quot;The increase in the minimum wage would have two principal effects on low-wage workers: The large majority would have higher wages and family income, but a much smaller group would be jobless and have much lower family income.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grimes said that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would lift &quot;over a million Americans out of poverty.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report she sites actually puts the net figure slightly less than a million, at about 900,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grimes&rsquo; campaign later said she misspoke but our job is to check what the candidates tell the voters at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stat Grimes actually said is close but not quite on the ball. We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-14T15:10:42.873106", "ruling_date": "2014-10-14T17:35:34", "ruling_headline": "Alison Lundergan Grimes says raising the minimum wage would lift a million people out of poverty", "ruling_headline_slug": "alison-lundergan-grimes-says-raising-minimum-wage-", "ruling_link_text": "Close \u2014 it's 900,000", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>C-SPAN, <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?321958-1/kentucky-senate-debate\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Kentucky Senate Debate</u></a>, Oct. 13, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PunditFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/may/11/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-minimum-wage-increase-would-cost-500/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Rick Santorum: Minimum wage increase would cost 500,000 jobs</u></a>,&quot; May 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44995-MinimumWage.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The effects of a minimum-wage increase on employment and family income</u></a>,&quot; February 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PunditFact, &quot; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/20/kai-ryssdal/marketplace-host-kai-ryssdal-talks-cbo-report-mini/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&lsquo;Marketplace&rsquo; host Kai Ryssdal talks CBO report on minimum wage and lost jobs,</u></a>&quot; Feb. 20, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Charly Norton, spokeswoman for Alison Lundergan Grimes, Oct. 14, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "Secretary of State", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Alison", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Kentucky", "id": 2514, "last_name": "Lundergan Grimes", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "alison-lundergan-grimes", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Grimes_pick.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2514/", "total_count": 9, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://alisonforkentucky.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, &quot;would help lift over a million Americans out of poverty.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a debate", "statement_date": "2014-10-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 184, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/184/", "subject": "Income", "subject_slug": "income", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 311, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/311/", "subject": "Message Machine 2014", "subject_slug": "message-machine-2014", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 29, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/29/", "subject": "Poverty", "subject_slug": "poverty", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 7, "current_job": "Senate minority leader", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "Mitch", "half_true_count": 6, "home_state": "Kentucky", "id": 106, "last_name": "McConnell", "mostly_true_count": 8, "name_slug": "mitch-mcconnell", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mcconnell.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/106/", "total_count": 33, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://mcconnell.senate.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
