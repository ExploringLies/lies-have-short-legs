The debt was too staggering. By 2004, 365 stores had closed.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat the chain failed isn&#39;t in dispute: KB Toys dissolved in bankruptcy court under different owners in 2008. We&rsquo;re checking the video&rsquo;s overall portrayal of the Bain-KB relationship in another item.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere, we&rsquo;ll check one specific claim made in the video:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Mitt Romney and Bain saw a 900 percent return on their investment&quot; in KB Toys, the video says. &quot;Romney and Bain&rsquo;s profits at the expense of 15,000 jobs was described by the <em>Boston Herald </em>as &lsquo;disgusting.&rsquo;&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition, the on-screen visual emphasizes the point, showing the text, &quot;&lsquo;disgusting profits,&rsquo; <em>Boston Herald, </em>11/17/2009.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat suggests the comment came from a <em>Herald </em>editorial or columnist. So we looked back at the article the video referenced -- a news story headlined, &quot;KB Toys worker blasts Bain for execs&#39; payout.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe story is about the campaign of Stephen Pagliuca for the Democratic nomination to fill the U.S. Senate seat made vacant upon the death of Edward Kennedy. Pagliuca is <a href=\"http://www.stevepagliuca.com/\">managing director of Bain Capital</a> as well as co-owner of the Boston Celtics. The story quotes a former KB Toys employee attacking Bain for its role in KB Toys&rsquo; demise, which the story says resulted in 450 job losses in the Boston area.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s an excerpt:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;&lsquo;They were supposed to be coming in to create jobs and help the company grow when they took us over. What happened?&#39;&rsquo; asked Mark W. Dean, a 45-year-old Pittsfield resident who has been out of a job since KB Toys went out of business earlier this year. &quot;It&#39;s just another political promise.&#39;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Pagliuca spokesman Will Keyser said the Celtics co-owner wasn&#39;t directly involved in managing the KB Toys takeover, although he did profit from the deal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;&lsquo;He has acknowledged over the course of the campaign that businesses he or his company invested in have failed, but the record of successes he&#39;s been involved in far outnumber the failures,&rsquo;&#39;&#39; said Keyser in a statement. ...<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Dean, who worked at KB Toys for 22 years, is still outraged by the $121 million payout to execs and investors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;&lsquo;That was disgusting. There were a lot of employees who were upset about that,&rsquo;&#39; Dean said.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what we have is a <em>Boston Herald </em>news story quoting an angry former employee -- not an impartial newspaper expressing outrage in its own voice, which is what the voice-over suggests. Nowhere does the ad note that the sentiments were actually expressed by a worker laid off by the company.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe story referenced by the video does contain the &quot;disgusting&quot; quote. But in both in the voice-over and the video, the &quot;King of Bain&quot; video suggests that the comment was spoken in the editorial voice of the <em>Boston Herald</em>. It wasn&#39;t -- it came from a laidoff worker. We rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-13T11:37:26.982428", "ruling_date": "2012-01-13T12:21:37", "ruling_headline": "'King of Bain' video says Boston Herald called Bain profits from KB Toys deal 'disgusting'", "ruling_headline_slug": "king-bain-video-says-boston-herald-called-bain-pro", "ruling_link_text": "Not the paper's view; a news story quoted a laid-off worker saying it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWinning Our Future, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.webcasts.com/kingofbain/\">When Mitt Romney Came to Town</a>&quot; (video), Jan. 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Boston Herald</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bostonherald.com/news/politics/view.bg?articleid=1212512\">KB Toys worker blasts Bain for execs&#39; payout</a>,&quot; Nov. 17, 2009 (accessed via Lexis-Nexis)</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "", "id": 1621, "last_name": "Winning Our Future", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "winning-our-future", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/winning.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1621/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.WinningOurFuture.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tMitt Romney&rsquo;s and Bain Capital&rsquo;s profits from KB Toys, which later went out of business, were &quot;described by the Boston Herald as &lsquo;disgusting.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "the video, \"When Mitt Romney Came to Town\"", "statement_date": "2012-01-12", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 219, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/219/", "subject": "Message Machine 2012", "subject_slug": "message-machine-2012", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/", "/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 34, "current_job": "Former governor", "false_count": 32, "first_name": "Mitt", "half_true_count": 58, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 5, "last_name": "Romney", "mostly_true_count": 33, "name_slug": "mitt-romney", "pants_count": 19, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-mittromney.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/5/", "total_count": 221, "true_count": 30, "website": "http://www.mittromney.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
