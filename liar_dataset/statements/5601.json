Gov. David Dewhurst, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, poked at the president by saying that &quot;Texans know three numbers that Obama would like to forget.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDewhurst&rsquo;s March 8, 2012, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1jn3gWaSSdLW79iNaokusQjLv3TyOc7RmcFP5VpudchA\">email blast</a> said the numbers are:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;1. $15.5 trillion in national debt<br />\r\n\t2. $4.50 per gallon gasoline<br />\r\n\t3. 1.2 million fewer jobs since Obama took office.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe email reflects the current size of the national debt, according to the <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">U.S. Treasury</a>. And one <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/03192012_blsemployedpeoplecounts.xls\">set of employment data</a> by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that more than 1.2 million fewer Americans were employed in February 2012 compared to December 2008, the month before Obama became president.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut $4.50-a-gallon gas? We sought backup.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy email, Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch told us a <a href=\"http://www.dallasgasprices.com/Dairy_Mart_Gas_Stations/Lewisville/111934/index.aspx\">Dairy Mart in Lewisville, Texas</a>, was charging $4.50 a gallon. We were unable to verify that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHirsch also pointed out a Feb. 28, 2012, ABC News <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2012/02/gas-prices-25-most-expensive-cities/\">online post</a>, headlined &quot;Gas Prices: 25 Most Expensive Cities,&quot; quoting figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration indicating that the average price of gasoline nationwide rose to $3.72 a gallon that week -- and had surpassed $4.25 a gallon in a dozen California cities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe post quotes Jason Toews, a co-founder of GasBuddy.com, which tracks prices at gas stations, saying: &quot;California typically has higher gas prices due to the special blend of gas mandated by the state. This blend of gas burns more cleanly for pollution control.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGasBuddy.com also listed the 25 highest gas prices nationally, topped by $4.35 a gallon in Santa Barbara, Calif. At No. 25 was Bridgeport, Conn., at nearly $3.96. No Texas cities made the list.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, gas was costing up to $4.35 a gallon in a California city before Dewhurst aired his figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor broader perspective, we turned to an EIA web page, <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/\">Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update</a>, which offers weekly average price updates for all kinds of motor fuel. And according to provided <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/xls/pswrgvwall.xls\">historical information</a>, the average U.S. price across six grades and formulations of gas -- regular, mid-grade and premium types -- the week of March 5, 2012, when Dewhurst sent his blast, was $3.85 a gallon, ranging from an average of $3.28 in Denver to $4.46 in Los Angeles. The Texas average was $3.67.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHirsch, Dewhurst&rsquo;s spokesman, pointed out that certain average gas prices have been $4.50 or more. In the week of March 5, 2012, according to EIA, the average price of <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/tbldefs/pet_pri_gnd_tbldef2.asp\">mid-grade gas,</a> defined by its mid-level anti-knock or octane rating, of all formulations in Los Angeles was nearly $4.51 a gallon; the average price for the same kind in San Francisco was $4.46. The national average was $3.92 while the Texas average was $3.76.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe same week, the average Los Angeles price for reformulated (or less-polluting) <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/tbldefs/pet_pri_gnd_tbldef2.asp\">premium gas</a>, which has a higher octane rating than mid-grade or regular gas, was $4.57 a gallon, a penny more than the average price for such gas in San Francisco. The average Texas price was $3.92 a gallon.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNationally, the EIA says, the average price of all grades and formulations of gas has been more than $3 a gallon since Dec. 6, 2010. It&rsquo;s been more than $2 a gallon since March 23, 2009. In Texas, gas of all grades and formulations topped out at an average price of $3.91 a gallon the week of May 12, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, Dewhurst&rsquo;s statement about gas prices suggests Obama is responsible for increasing gas prices when a president&rsquo;s impact on those prices is limited. John B. Townsend II, a spokesman for the mid-Atlantic region of the American Automobile Association, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/08/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-gasoline-cost-179-gallon-whe/\">told PolitiFact </a>in September 2011 that &quot;other than lip service, there is little any president or member of Congress can do about the price of gas, since 70 percent of the cost of a gallon is determined by the cost of crude oil.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, $4.50 a gallon? Sure, you can find that price if you look hard enough -- especially if you&rsquo;re driving California. But Dewhurst&rsquo;s comment implies that $4.50 gas is commonplace. That&rsquo;s an exaggeration. Average gas prices were 15 to 20 percent lower in the week when Dewhurst blasted Obama, who also doesn&rsquo;t control the price of gas.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-21T18:31:22.993937", "ruling_date": "2012-03-22T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "David Dewhurst says gas costs $4.50 a gallon", "ruling_headline_slug": "david-dewhurst-says-gas-costs-450-gallon", "ruling_link_text": "California, maybe", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tABC News, blog post, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2012/02/gas-prices-25-most-expensive-cities/\">&quot;Gas Prices: 25 Most Expensive Cities,&quot;</a> Feb. 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDavid Dewhurst campaign, email blast, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1jn3gWaSSdLW79iNaokusQjLv3TyOc7RmcFP5VpudchA\">&quot;Obama&rsquo;s three devastating numbers,&quot;</a> March 8, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Energy Information Administration, web page, <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/\">&quot;Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update</a>&quot; and <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/xls/pswrgvwall.xls\">historical gas-price information</a> (accessed March 19, 2012)</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "Lieutenant governor", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "David", "half_true_count": 10, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 315, "last_name": "Dewhurst", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "david-dewhurst", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Dewhurstmug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/315/", "total_count": 41, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://www.daviddewhurst.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays gas costs $4.50 a gallon.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an email blast.", "statement_date": "2012-03-08", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 204, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/204/", "subject": "Gas Prices", "subject_slug": "gas-prices", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
