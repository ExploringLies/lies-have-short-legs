Bill Young&rsquo;s open House seat has concluded, Pinellas County can get back to worrying about other issues -- like the fledgling mass transit initiative called Greenlight Pinellas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not everyone is a fan of the expanded transportation plan, with the activist group No Tax For Tracks being its most vocal opponent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Greenlight Pinellas is nothing but an attempt to put a Happy Face on a 300 percent Tax increase and Money Grab,&quot; the group&rsquo;s website, <a href=\"http://railtaxfacts.com/\"><u>RailTaxFacts.com</u></a> trumpets as a counterpoint to the plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 300 percent tax increase sounds like pretty hefty fee to build a light rail line and add more buses. We decided to look into the claim and find out if the county really would be taken for a ride.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Taxes vs. revenues</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greenlight Pinellas is a countywide transportation initiative that proposes expanding bus service throughout the county -- by adding routes in northern Pinellas and extending hours -- as well as adding a 24-mile light rail line between St. Petersburg and Clearwater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entire plan hinges on whether Pinellas voters on Nov. 4 approve a sales tax increase from 7 percent to 8 percent, making the county&rsquo;s sales tax rate the highest in the state. The higher sales tax would replace the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority&rsquo;s current county funding, a property tax assessed at a 0.7305 millage rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sales tax would only go up on items already subject to the sales tax; Florida has a long list of items that are not taxed, such as medicine, groceries, certain agricultural and manufacturing startup equipment. It also would be limited to the first $5,000 of major purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The change would take effect Jan. 1, 2016. If it&rsquo;s adopted, any future changes to the Greenlight plan, such as an extension of the proposed rail line, would be subject to a referendum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new sales tax is projected to increase the authority&rsquo;s budget from its current $34 million per year to about $120 million to $130 million, said Bob Lasher, the agency&rsquo;s external affairs officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the source of No Tax For Tracks&rsquo; claim that the tax revenue expansion amounts to &quot;a 300% tax increase.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group argues that not only is the plan&rsquo;s feasibility suspect, but the increase in the authority&rsquo;s budget is unconscionable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What we&rsquo;re asserting is that their revenue will increase 300 percent,&quot; No Tax For Tracks spokeswoman Barb Haselden told PolitiFact Florida. &quot;They&rsquo;re broadening their budget with a tax increase on the non-homeowner poor. &hellip; It&rsquo;s a regressive tax that is not necessary.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How much would the percent increase actually be for individual taxpayers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greenlight Pinellas illustrates its plan using Census averages from 2008 to 2012, taking as a case study a median-family home in Pinellas County, which costs about $161,000. Under that scenario, the portion of property taxes that goes to the transit authority today is just less than $90.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greenlight also looks at a median-income family with two children earning about $46,000. Using the IRS sales tax deduction calculator, Greenlight concluded that this family will pay about $800 in sales taxes annually at the new 8 percent rate, about $104 more per year than they paid under the 7 percent rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the plan, a family that owns a $161,000 home and makes about $46,000 would stop paying the $90 share of the property tax destined for the transit authority, but it would instead pay $104 in additional sales taxes. Allowing some uncertainty for the exact mix of taxed and tax-exempt purchases, that&rsquo;s a tax hike of about 15 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The increase in dollars in this example is pretty modest -- $14 more per year. Other residents, however, could face heftier impacts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>County residents who currently don&rsquo;t own real estate won&rsquo;t benefit from the authority&rsquo;s switch from property tax revenue to sales tax revenue, so if they owe $104 in additional sales taxes, that won&rsquo;t be offset by tax reductions. Still, on a percentage basis, that&rsquo;s an increase in sales tax burden of about 14 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s not correct to call either of these examples of increases a &quot;300% tax increase.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No Tax For Tracks actually gets the talking point correct elsewhere on its website, saying, &quot;Now PSTA wants to &#39;replace&#39; the property tax by increasing our sales tax from 7&nbsp;percent to 8 percent. That&rsquo;s a 14&nbsp;percent increase! To convince us to vote &#39;Yes&#39;, they are calling it a &#39;Tax Swap&#39;.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No Tax For Tracks says Greenlight Pinellas will balloon the transit authority&rsquo;s budget by imposing &quot;a 300% tax increase.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That number comes from an estimated increase in the transit authority&rsquo;s operating budget from $32 million to about $130 million per year. But that&rsquo;s an increase in revenues to the agency, not an increase in the tax rate to individual taxpayers. In reality, no group would face a 300 percent increase. We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-03-19T17:38:18.982081", "ruling_date": "2014-03-20T13:51:26", "ruling_headline": "Greenlight Pinellas means a '300% tax increase,' No Tax For Tracks says", "ruling_headline_slug": "greenlight-pinellas-means-300-tax-increase-no-tax-", "ruling_link_text": "A revenue increase, not a tax hike", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>No Tax For Tracks <a href=\"http://railtaxfacts.com/\"><u>website</u></a>, accessed March 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/local/a-pinellas-light-rail-system-could-cost-as-much-as-74-billion/994521\"><u>A Pinellas light rail system could cost as much as $7.4 billion</u></a>,&quot; April 22, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/florida-lawmakers-back-tax-swap-for-pinellas-rail-buses/1217009\"><u>Florida lawmakers back tax swap for Pinellas rail, buses</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 24, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/transportation/masstransit/pinellas-likely-to-vote-on-sales-tax-for-rail-and-bus-service/1271889\"><u>Florida lawmakers back tax swap for Pinellas rail, buses</u></a>,&quot; Jan. 23, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority, <a href=\"http://busplan.psta.net/PDF/PH%20Mins%209-11-13.pdf\"><u>Board of Directors meeting minutes</u></a>, Sept. 11, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/transportation/masstransit/transit-sales-tax-idea-has-narrow-edge-on-both-sides-of-tampa-bay/2158964\"><u>Transit sales tax idea has narrow edge on both sides of Tampa Bay</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 29, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority, <a href=\"http://www.psta.net/PDF/The%20Greenlight%20Pinellas%20Plan%20-%20DEC%202013.pdf\"><u>The Greenlight Pinellas Plan</u></a>, December 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Bob Lasher, PSTA external affairs officer, March 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Barb Haselden, No Tax For Tracks spokeswoman, March 18, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "", "id": 2686, "last_name": "No Tax For Tracks", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "no-tax-tracks", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/notax.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2686/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>The Greenlight Pinellas transportation plan involves a &quot;300% tax increase.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "on their website", "statement_date": "2014-03-17", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
