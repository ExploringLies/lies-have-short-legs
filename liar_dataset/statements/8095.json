Rob Portman thinks the price can be more than it&rsquo;s worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &nbsp;Ohio Republican made the point in his <a href=\"http://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2013/7/your-tax-dollars-down-the-drain-state-department-spent-630-000-to-obtain-2-million-facebook-likes\"><u>monthly statement for July</u></a> &quot;highlighting Washington&rsquo;s wasteful spending during a time of record debt and deficits.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This one, decrying &quot;tax dollars down the drain,&quot; said the U.S. State Department &quot;spent $630,000 to obtain 2 million Facebook &#39;Likes&#39;.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;With Washington running budget deficits of more than $1 trillion &ndash; or $10,000 per household &ndash; the Administration should not be wasting taxpayer dollars on frivolous items such as attempting to buy Facebook fans,&quot; Portman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That clicked with PolitiFact Ohio. We wanted to know more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portman said his source was a report by the U.S. State Department&rsquo;s inspector general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Completed in May, the <a href=\"http://oig.state.gov/documents/organization/211193.pdf\"><u>57-page report</u></a> was one in a periodic series examining policy implementation, resource management and management controls in the State Department&#39;s Bureau of International Information Programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report says the bureau launched digital diplomacy campaigns in 2011 and 2012 that started or expanded online activities in six foreign languages, and started or expanded English-language Facebook pages, Twitter feeds and blogs aimed at foreign audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The bureau spent about $630,000 on the two campaigns,&quot; the inspector general found, &quot;and succeeded in increasing the fans of the English Facebook pages from about 100,000 to more than 2 million for each page. Advertising also helped increase interest in the foreign language pages; by March 2013, they ranged from 68,000 to more than 450,000 fans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Many in the bureau criticize the advertising campaigns as &#39;buying fans&#39; who may have once clicked on an ad or &#39;liked&#39; a photo but have no real interest in the topic and have never engaged further,&quot; the report said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The inspector general found that the number of Facebook users who actually engaged with each page was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/07/03/ig-report-state-department-spent-630000-to-increase-facebook-likes/\"><u>relatively small</u></a>, with only about 2 percent &quot;liking,&quot; sharing or commenting on any item within the previous week. And the report said that the <a href=\"http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/07/02/omg_state_department_dropped_630000_on_facebook_likes?wp_login_redirect=0\"><u>bureau&#39;s target audience</u></a> is older and more influential than the people likely to spend hours engaging on the social site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The campaign became less effective in 2012, the report said, when Facebook changed its mechanics, making the bureau&#39;s fan pages less prominent to users who did not engage with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But engaging with fans might not be an improvement over trying to increase the number of them, the inspector general said: &quot;The bureau could reduce spending and increase strategic impact by focusing its advertising not on raising overall fan numbers or general engagement statistics but on accomplishing specific PD [public diplomacy] goals.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked about the report during a <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2013/07/\"><u>daily briefing with reporters</u></a> on July 3. She said that the Bureau of International Information Programs had cut its spending on Facebook ads, from $315,000 a year to $36,000 a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Spending on online advertising has significantly decreased,&quot; she said. &quot;It&rsquo;s now at $2,500 a month, and that still allows us to reach out and communicate with a wide range of individuals living overseas. And on June 27th, IIP also submitted to OIG (Office of the Inspector General) its strategy for implementing the report&rsquo;s recommendations, and also provided an update on those that have already been met. IIP will implement the majority of OIG&rsquo;s recommendations on or before the start of fiscal year 2014.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to know that the inspector general&#39;s stinging report found that the Facebook campaign was being questioned in the bureau by November 2012, and that spending has been cut by almost 90 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Portman&#39;s statement about the State Department spending for Facebook &quot;Likes&quot; is accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, it rates True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-07-31T14:20:19.105460", "ruling_date": "2013-08-01T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
