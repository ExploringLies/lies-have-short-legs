John Kasich has been repeating an odd talking point lately: He keeps saying how unpopular he was as governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ohio leader and presidential candidate said it in a Republican debate on <a href=\"http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2016/03/30/full-rush-transcript-gov-john-kasich-cnn-milwaukee-republican-presidential-town-hall/\">March 30</a>. On <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcripts-april-24-2016-kasich-sanders/\">April 24</a>, he repeated it on CBS <em>Face the Nation</em> when host John Dickerson asked if he thought it was possible for a candidate to change negative perceptions about him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;After my first year as governor, I was one of the most unpopular governors, maybe the most unpopular governor in the country,&quot; Kasich said. &quot;It takes a long time to change negatives. People have to see that you&#39;re actually being fruitful in your work. What happened with me is when people started getting work, and we started balancing budgets and reaching out to people, it changed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is he right about being the least beloved state leader across the land after his first year in office?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2011/08/kasich-still-unpopular-voters-set-to-overturn-senate-bill-5.html\">August 2011 poll</a> by Public Policy Polling said that with a 36 percent approval rating, he was the second or third least popular governor in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was at least a few points better than in March 2011, when the same pollsters found Kasich&rsquo;s approval ratings in the basement at <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/ohio/release-detail?ReleaseID=1570\">30 percent</a>, and in May 2011 at <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2011/08/kasich-still-unpopular-voters-set-to-overturn-senate-bill-5.html\">33 percent</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where was the love?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 2011, his third month in office, Kasich made boatloads of enemies with a stroke of his pen. Kasich signed a massive union reform bill that prohibited forced union membership for state employees, mandated merit pay, outlawed strikes and limited collective bargaining rights for public employees. Unlike a similar reform bill in Wisconsin, Ohio&rsquo;s SB 5 included police and firefighters. The political backlash was immediate, and a repeal effort quickly coalesced and <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/politics/index.ssf/2011/11/ohio_voters_overwhelmingly_rej.html\">reversed </a>Kasich&rsquo;s attempt at reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vying for the&nbsp;title&nbsp;of most unpopular governor in 2011 was Florida&rsquo;s Republican Gov. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/30/john-kasich-rick-scott-popularity-approval-rating_n_989545.html\">Rick Scott.</a> Public Policy Polling found that Kasich edged out Scott for most unfavorable governor in <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2011/09/scotts-numbers-on-the-rise-would-still-lose-though.html\">September 2011</a> with a 53 percent disapproval rating, compared to Scott&rsquo;s 52 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Kasich said he was (maybe) the country&rsquo;s most unpopular governor after his first year. If he took office in January 2011, then we&rsquo;d need to know his approval rating for the first few months of 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/staff/louis-jacobson/\">Louis Jacobson</a> looked at the cast of rookie governors in February 2012, one year into their terms, for <em>Governing </em>magazine. Kasich made Jacobson&rsquo;s list of the seven rookie governors who were struggling the most. Here they are, by approval rating:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jerry Brown (D-CA): 47 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rick Scott (R-FL): 43 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neil Abercrombie (D-HI): 39 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott Walker (R-WI): 38 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nikki Haley (R-SC): 35 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Kasich (R-OH): 33 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lincoln Chafee (I -RI): 22 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on these numbers, Kasich is the second-most unpopular governor after his first year. But Jacobson&rsquo;s analysis only counted the 26 governors who took office at the start of 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jacobson notes that approval ratings for governors aren&rsquo;t exactly the holy grail of polling. He had to consult a handful of different polling groups for his comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter A. Brown, the assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, concurred. &quot;Nobody&rsquo;s done every governor in the country,&quot; he said. &quot;There&rsquo;s no reason to.&quot; He said Quinnipiac only polls from nine states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What you can say is that it&rsquo;s not possible to determine (whether Kasich was the least popular governor in the country),&quot; Brown said. &quot;But in a general sense, he&rsquo;s probably right. He was certainly close to the bottom.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rob Nichols, Kasich&rsquo;s presidential campaign spokesman who was also the spokesman for the governor&rsquo;s office in 2011, told us, &quot;Well yeah, we had just come from the election with $10 million in negative attack ads against us. So the last thing you saw was all this TV, trashing him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nichols also gave us this anecdote: In August 2011, his official email inbox was bombarded with form letters that started out, &quot;Dear Gov. Kasich staff member, I wanted Gov. Kasich to know that I voted for him in the Worst Governor Ever contest at <a href=\"http://www.worstgovernorever.com\">www.worstgovernorever.com</a>....&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I got so many that I had to get our IT people to route them to a special mailbox so they wouldn&rsquo;t destroy my inbox,&quot; Nichols said. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ohioans started to warm to Kasich after the turbulent first year. Later in 2012, his rating bumped up to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/02/28/gov-john-kasichs-remarkable-rebound-continues-in-ohio/\">40s</a>, and was up to 53 percent approval in 2013. <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/\">Quinnipiac University</a> had Kasich polling at 62 percent favorability in October 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kasich said, &quot;After my first year as governor, I was one of the most unpopular governors, maybe the most unpopular governor in the country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At its lowest, in March 2011, his favorability among the Ohioans who had just elected him was an abysmal 30 percent. That was bad enough to crown Kasich as the least-popular governor in America for a brief period.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/07cb0b24-24d4-48e0-ab79-eba9ac513130\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/07cb0b24-24d4-48e0-ab79-eba9ac513130</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-04-29T11:58:51.939460", "ruling_date": "2016-05-02T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Yes, John Kasich is bragging about being unpopular", "ruling_headline_slug": "yes-john-kasich-bragging-about-being-unpopular", "ruling_link_text": "Winning the unpopularity contest", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Poll, Public Policy Polling, <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2011/08/kasich-still-unpopular-voters-set-to-overturn-senate-bill-5.html\">Aug. 18, 2011</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poll, Public Policy Polling, <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2011/09/scotts-numbers-on-the-rise-would-still-lose-though.html\">Sept. 30, 2011</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poll, Brown University, <a href=\"https://news.brown.edu/articles/2012/10/survey\">Oct. 10, 2012</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Peter A.
