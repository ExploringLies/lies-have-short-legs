That&rsquo;s an 11-point advantage -- more than twice the size of Carter&rsquo;s lead over Reagan in 1980 at the same point in the campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Trump&rsquo;s numbers are not, contrary to his assertion, &quot;better right now than Ronald Reagan&#39;s numbers were with Jimmy Carter.&quot; They are worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that there was a period during the 1980 campaign when Carter actually was far ahead of Reagan in head-to-head polling, but it was brief and it was winding down -- if not gone entirely -- by this point in the campaign. After American hostages were taken in Iran in November 1979, Carter&rsquo;s approval ratings initially spiked, in what historians sometimes call a &quot;rally round the flag&quot; effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can be seen in <a href=\" http://www.gallup.com/poll/124922/presidential-job-approval-center.aspx\">Gallup&rsquo;s job approval ratings below</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/o5Q1UcsKwUuQzTqDzoh3pVq8Gn8E1TOVbxBgxgu74ZJlTKe_9doBAAJ-20XuiwwcrRzN3JXhx9BJuavEJlsmjjb-NpYZpkW7uIpYOWanlwDS8Y-iN35vsNi0A4CQRhg1IY5Gyk67\" style=\"border:none; height:253px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By January 1980, Carter&rsquo;s job approval rating in the Gallup poll had risen to 58&nbsp;percent. But by late March, it was back down again, to 39 percent. And that decline -- combined with the emergence of Anderson&rsquo;s independent bid -- made the Carter-Reagan head-to-head contest much closer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This trend can be seen in 1980 <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/2012/08/what-really-happened-in-the-1980-presidential-campaign/\">polling data from political scientists Christopher Wlezien and Robert S.

That&rsquo;s five percentage points &quot;under water&quot; -- favorable minus unfavorable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, Trump&rsquo;s poll averages for favorability in 2015 and 2016 have -- at their best -- been 17 points under water. Currently, they are at 64 percent unfavorable, 30 percent favorable, <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/donald-trump-favorable-rating\">according to HuffPost Pollster</a>.

About 70 percent placed him on the positive (favorable) side of that scale, compared to just 27 percent who placed him on the negative (unfavorable) side of that scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And a CBS News/<em>New York Times</em> poll in April 1980 asked, &quot;Are there any candidates -- Carter, Reagan or Anderson -- you would refuse to vote for under any circumstances?&quot; Only 13 percent said they would definitely shun Reagan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s recent &quot;never-vote-for&quot; percentages are much higher. In two polls, a full 54 percent of those polled said they would definitely not vote for Trump -- an Associated Press/GfK poll in February 2016 and a Quinnipiac poll in March 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Reagan never had the high unfavorables that Trump does now,&quot; said Reagan biographer Lou Cannon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Did people say Reagan&rsquo;s candidacy would be &lsquo;a disaster&rsquo;?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not in the national media coverage we found on Nexis, at least.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David Broder, the legendary political reporter with the <em>Washington Post</em>, wrote a piece on March 12, 1980, that was headlined, &quot;Despite Primary Triumphs, Carter Could Be Vulnerable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On April 7, <em>Newsweek </em>concluded its article this way: &quot;The politics of discontent has already propelled Ronald Reagan nearly to the Republican nomination, enticed John Anderson to the brink of a third-line candidacy -- and now brought home the message that Jimmy Carter is once again in trouble.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And on May 8, 1980, the <em>Post </em>published an article headlined, &quot;Poll Shows Reagan Now Likely Winner.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Craig Shirley, who has written several books on Reagan, what he thought of of Trump&rsquo;s comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are just too many personal and ideological and cultural differences between Trump and Reagan and their times to draw anything resembling a parallel,&quot; Shirley said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;My numbers are better right now than Ronald Reagan&#39;s numbers were with Jimmy Carter. ... Ronald Reagan had a 30 (percent) favorability and he was behind Jimmy Carter by so much everybody said, &#39;Oh this is going to be a disaster.&#39; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that Trump&rsquo;s deficit against Clinton during March and April 2016 was twice the size of Reagan&rsquo;s deficit against Carter in March and April 1980. We also found that Trump&rsquo;s favorable/unfavorable ratings are much worse than Reagan&rsquo;s were during that same period.
