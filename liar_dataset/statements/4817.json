During his remarks, Thompson attempted to make the case that economic conditions were better in right to work states than in Ohio, citing the Buckeye State&rsquo;s unemployment rate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We&rsquo;re hovering around 9-10 percent unemployment at any given time, which is significantly higher than the unemployment rate in states which are not forced union states and it&rsquo;s always been that way,&quot; Thompson said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJust minutes later&mdash;at a separate statehouse news conference&mdash;House Democrats argued much the opposite -- that unemployment rates in right to work states actually aren&rsquo;t any lower than Ohio&rsquo;s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo it seemed like a good time to check into Thompson&rsquo;s statement. Had Ohio&rsquo;s unemployment rate &quot;always&quot; been higher?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s fairly easy to compare unemployment rates in different states thanks to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which diligently tracks and compiles the information each month.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitifact asked Thompson for a source listing right-to-work states and sent us a link to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Fund, which lists 22 states primarily in the south and west which have right-to-work statutes on the books. The fund has a database to the relevant section of law in each state so the fund&rsquo;s information on what states have the laws looked to be unbiased. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe compared Ohio&rsquo;s unemployment rate of 9.1 for September 2011 to those 22 states and found that eight right-to-work states had higher unemployment rates, 13 had lower unemployment rates and one was precisely the same (Arizona). For what its worth, Ohio&rsquo;s rate dipped to 9.0 for October, but we&rsquo;re sticking with the September figures here, as they were the most current numbers available when Thompson made his claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThree of the 13 states with lower unemployment rates in September were within one percentage point of Ohio&rsquo;s &mdash; Idaho at 9.0 percent, Texas at 8.5 percent and Arkansas at 8.3 percent. If the jobless rate in Ohio is less than one percent greater, does that count as &quot;significantly higher,&quot; as Thompson said? We&rsquo;re not convinced.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThus, we are left with 10 of 22 right-to-work states with &quot;significantly&quot; lower unemployment rates than Ohio.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe tail end of Thompson&rsquo;s statement makes a second claim &mdash; that Ohio has always had an unemployment rate higher than right-to-work states. To test this portion of his statement, we looked at both the high and low water marks for Ohio&rsquo;s unemployment rate over the last decade to give a s snapshot of how Ohio stacked up against right-to-work states during both good and bad economic times.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Ohio had its lowest point of unemployment in the state&rsquo;s history &mdash; 3.8 percent in January 2001 &mdash; there were still eight right-to-work states with lower unemployment. Fourteen had higher unemployment rates. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Ohio had the highest rate of unemployment over the last decade &mdash; 10.6 percent in Feb. 2010 &mdash; 18 states had lower unemployment rates. Four right-to-work states had higher unemployment rates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe think it&rsquo;s likely that Ohio has ranked somewhere between No.5 and No. 15 in highest unemployment rates when compared to the 22 right-to-work states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson also forwarded information from Stanley Greer, a staffer with the National Right to Work Legal Defense Fund, who argued that on the average right-to-work states have slightly lower unemployment rates than states without the laws. Greer also produced statistics that argue that private employment has fallen in non right-to-work states but grown in right-to-work states over the past decade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrankly, we don&rsquo;t think that information is pertinent to evaluating the truthfulness of Thompson&rsquo;s claim, which focused solely on the unemployment rate in Ohio as compared to right-to-work states. So let&rsquo;s return to that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson flatly stated that Ohio&rsquo;s unemployment rate was &quot;significantly higher&quot; than the rates in right-to-work states and has &quot;always&quot; been that way.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that 12 of 22 right-to-work states have unemployment rates that are very similar to Ohio&rsquo;s or greater. Less than half have &quot;significantly&quot; lower unemployment rates. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for Ohio &quot;always&quot; having had a higher unemployment rate, a check of Ohio&rsquo;s rate at its highest and lowest points over the past decade shows 14 of the right-to-work states had higher unemployment rates than Ohio when the rate was at its lowest. And when Ohio&rsquo;s rate was at its highest, there still were four right-to-work states with higher jobless rates. Ohio&rsquo;s unemployment rate is not higher than all right-to-work states and very likely has never been. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson&rsquo;s claim is not accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his claim False.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-20T17:35:53.785682", "ruling_date": "2011-11-21T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ohio unemployment 'significantly higher' than right-to-work states, says chief of 1851 Center for Constitutional Law", "ruling_headline_slug": "ohio-unemployment-significantly-higher-right-work-", "ruling_link_text": "Claim doesn't work on either count", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tMaurice Thompson, executive director of 1851 Center for Constitutional Law, Statehouse news conference Nov. 10, 2011, audio tape transcribed by Plain Dealer reporter Aaron Marshall<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-Mail correspondence with Maurice Thompson, including forwarded information from Stanley Greer of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Fund, Nov. 10 and Nov. 15, 2011. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/lau/\">state unemployment rates and historical data regarding unemployment rates over the past 10 years</a><br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tNational Right to Work Legal Defense Fund, <a href=\"http://www.nrtw.org/rtws\">22 states that have right-to-work laws</a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Executive director of the 1851 Center for Constitutional Law", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Maurice", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 1549, "last_name": "Thompson", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "maurice-thompson", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/polit-maurice-thompson.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1549/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.ohioconstitution.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays unemployment in Ohio &quot;is significantly higher than the unemployment rate in states which are not forced union states and it&rsquo;s always been that way.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a news conference", "statement_date": "2011-11-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 192, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/192/", "subject": "Labor", "subject_slug": "labor", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 206, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/206/", "subject": "Unions", "subject_slug": "unions", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
