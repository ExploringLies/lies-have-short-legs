John Kasich but it is not in effect yet. Organized labor groups and Democrats are trying to repeal SB 5 through a voter referendum this fall because they say the law is unfair to middle-class, working families.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState Sen. Tim Grendell, a Republican from Chesterland who voted against SB 5, criticized the new structure for paying teachers during a televised forum about the state budget April 18 in Cleveland.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In Senate Bill 5, there is this new method of evaluating teachers&hellip;you&rsquo;re also going to be rated on what the parents think of you and they can send questionnaires and surveys home to parents,&quot; Grendell said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAllowing parents to play a role in evaluating teachers &ndash; and ultimately deciding how much they get paid &ndash; is problematic, Grendell said, because teachers are responsible for disciplining their children.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince SB 5 continues to be a heavily debated issue and because supporters of the law have accused teachers unions of misleading their members about how the law will affect salaries, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Grendell&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWithin SB 5 &ndash; a massive law change that overhauls collective bargaining for public employees and establishes numerous rules regarding pay and benefits &ndash; is a section devoted to paying teachers. The law eliminates the previous structure set in law, which sets raises based on a teacher&rsquo;s education level and work experience.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe law says that school boards must adopt a pay structure based on a teacher&rsquo;s performance. The law does not prescribe dollar amounts for salaries, but it says that districts must factor five categories into their performance-based pay schedule: what type of license the teacher holds, whether the teacher is &quot;highly qualified&quot; as defined by state law, students&rsquo; classroom performance, teacher performance evaluations, and any other criteria the board decides to incorporate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGrendell&rsquo;s claim related to teacher evaluations, so let&rsquo;s zero in on that aspect of the performance-based pay structure. SB 5 includes a description of what the teacher evaluations would look like.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe law requires the State Board of Education to establish a framework for the evaluations. Local school districts then will adopt their own specific evaluations based on the state&rsquo;s framework.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe evaluations will include whether parents and students are satisfied with a teacher, &quot;which may be measured by surveys, questionnaires, or other forms of soliciting feedback,&quot; the law reads.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTeacher evaluations also will measure how the teacher works in the classroom, which can be gauged by classroom observations; how the teacher communicates with students, parents, colleagues and members of the community; and students&rsquo; test scores.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLocal school districts will have some discretion in deciding how to weight the different pieces of teacher evaluations, but they are expected to include each factor laid out under the new law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs Grendell pointed out at the budget forum, the law does call for parent questionnaires to gauge parent&rsquo;s satisfaction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-25T16:04:02.198302", "ruling_date": "2011-04-26T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "State Senator Tim Grendell says parent questionnaires to have a role in setting teacher pay", "ruling_headline_slug": "state-senator-tim-grendell-says-parent-questionnai", "ruling_link_text": "Parent satisfaction one piece of the evaluation process", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tideastream, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ideastream.org/programs/budget_forum\">Cut, Tax or Change: The Kasich Budget Challenge</a>,&quot; April 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t129th Ohio General Assembly, <a href=\"http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/BillText129/129_SB_5_EN_N.pdf\">Ohio Senate Bill 5, as enrolled</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOhio Legislative Service Commission, <a href=\"http://www.lsc.state.oh.us/analyses129/s0005-rh-129.pdf\">analysis of SB 5</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Matt Dotson, lobbyist for the Ohio Education Association<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Patrick Gallaway, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Education<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview and e-mail correspondence with Michael Dittoe, spokesman for House Speaker William G.
