It&rsquo;s an ad from AFSCME, a public workers union, that seeks to equate the Republican presidential candidate with Scott, the current governor of Florida. Scott&rsquo;s approval numbers have been among the lowest in the country is recent months.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What kind of businessman is Mitt Romney?&quot; the ad asks. &quot;While Romney was a director of the Damon Corp., the company was defrauding Medicare of millions. Prosecutors called it &lsquo;corporate greed run amok.&rsquo; The company was fined $100 million. But Romney himself made a fortune. Corporate greed &hellip; Medicare fraud. Sound familiar?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve written frequently about Scott&rsquo;s time running hospital chain Columbia/HCA and its troubles surrounding Medicare (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/jun/10/bill-mccollum/rick-scott-leading-polls-opponents-pull-out-fraud-/\">You can read up on it here</a>.) Here, we&rsquo;re checking the ad&rsquo;s initial claim, that while Romney was &quot;a director of the Damon Corp., the company was defrauding Medicare of millions.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney&rsquo;s ties to a company charged with Medicare fraud haven&rsquo;t been discussed much lately, but it&rsquo;s old news to people in Massachusetts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Boston media investigated the facts of the case when Romney ran for governor in 2002 and won. It&rsquo;s also addressed in <em>The Real Romney</em>, a new biography by reporters with the <em>Boston Globe</em>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe story begins in 1989, when Romney was the head of Bain Capital, a private equity firm that specialized in buying troubled companies, turning them around, and then selling them for a profit. That year, Bain bought Damon Corp., a medical testing company based in Needham, Mass.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBain took the company public in 1991, and Romney served on the company&rsquo;s board of directors. In 1993, Bain orchestrated a sale of the company to Corning Inc., getting a handsome return on its investment and earning Romney himself $473,000, according to <em>The Real Romney</em>. After the sale, Corning closed the main facility in Needham, laying off 115 people.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn October 1996, federal prosecutors announced that Damon was agreeing to pay $119 million in both civil and criminal fines after pleading guilty to defrauding Medicare. The company was &nbsp;providing doctors with forms that didn&rsquo;t make clear what tests included, so doctors were checking off additional tests that weren&rsquo;t necessary, according to the <em>Globe&rsquo;s </em>summary of the government&rsquo;s case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe overbilling went from 1988 through 1993, prosecutors said. &quot;This is a case, pure and simple, of corporate greed run amok,&quot; U.S. Attorney Donald Stern said when the settlement was announced.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney was never implicated in the case. His role became an issue later, in 2002, when he ran for governor. Romney claimed that he helped uncover the fraud, but <em>Globe </em>reporting put that claim into question. The <em>Globe </em>reported that court records showed fraudulent activity occurred under Bain&rsquo;s watch, and that prosecutors gave the credit to Corning for stopping the fraud. Aides later said Romney&rsquo;s remarks that he helped uncover the fraud were misunderstood. We asked the campaign for comment, but we didn&rsquo;t hear back.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn <em>The Real Romney</em>, authors Michael Kranish and Scott Helman note that Romney seemed to have two views about what happened at Damon. &quot;On the one hand, he said he hadn&rsquo;t known what was going on at Damon; on the other, he said he&rsquo;d helped to put a stop to practices later found to be fraudulent. One thing that looked good at Damon was the bottom line for Bain. In the end, it was a profitable deal for both the firm and Romney, however tainted by legal troubles and layoffs it may have been.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad claims that, &quot;While Romney was a director of the Damon Corporation, the company was defrauding Medicare of millions.&quot;&nbsp;That&#39;s true, but&nbsp;Romney was never implicated personally with the fraudulent activity at the company, and it was one of many&nbsp;companies with which Bain was&nbsp;involved. It&rsquo;s also difficult to assess whether Romney knew about the fraud or should have known, and what he did to stop it. So the statement is correct&nbsp;but leaves out context. We rate this statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-23T13:58:28.462925", "ruling_date": "2012-01-23T17:35:04", "ruling_headline": "Was Mitt Romney the director of a company charged with Medicare fraud?
