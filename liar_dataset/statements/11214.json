Russ Feingold called for gradually raising the federal minimum wage to $15. It is now set at $7.25 an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And without mentioning Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson by name, the Democrat attacked Johnson. The two are poised for a rematch in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now, my likely opponent, the incumbent senator, opposes entirely -- get this, opposes entirely -- a federal minimum wage,&quot; Feingold said Aug. 18, 2015. &quot;At least for Americans -- apparently he has some openness about guest workers -- disrespecting the hard work and dignity of too many working Wisconsinites.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson has often <a href=\"http://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?start=0&amp;entqrm=0&amp;client=ronjohnson&amp;num=10&amp;filter=0&amp;p=search&amp;wc_mc=1&amp;wc=200&amp;entqr=3&amp;site=ronjohnson&amp;q=minimum%20wage&amp;btng=Go\">spoken against</a> raising the minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But does he oppose there being any general federal minimum wage law?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hot topic -- $10, $12 or $15</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raising the federal minimum wage is a common campaign plank among Democrats. A month before Feingold&rsquo;s speech, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-minimum-wage-bill_55afbbd1e4b0a9b9485332eb\">introduced</a> legislation for an increase to $15 an hour. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/08/17/its-hillary-clinton-and-barack-obama-versus-liberals-on-the-minimum-wage/\">Meanwhile</a>, Democratic presidential contender Martin O&rsquo;Malley also backs $15, while front runner Hillary Clinton, like President Barack Obama, has expressed support for $12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many Republicans -- including Johnson and one of the leading GOP candidates for president, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker -- oppose a raise. Walker argued in 2014 that minimum-wage jobs are overwhelmingly for young people starting out in the work force, a statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/jan/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-minimum-wage-jobs-are-overwhelmi/\">we rated False.</a> We found the best estimates were that 24 percent to 55 percent of such jobs are held by teenagers and young adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But later in the year, PolitiFact National rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/14/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-minimum-wage-hike-would-destr/\">Mostly True</a> a claim by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would &quot;destroy&quot; between 500,000 and 1 million jobs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had said that &quot;roughly&quot; 500,000 workers could lose their jobs, but that most likely the range was between very few to 1 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Johnson said</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back Feingold&rsquo;s claim, his campaign cited <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/1006/140703ronjohnson.mp3\">comments</a> Johnson made more than a year earlier, at a July 2, 2014 WisPolitics luncheon in Milwaukee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A member of the audience asked Johnson: &quot;What should the federal minimum wage be? Or should there not be a minimum wage?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson replied:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Shouldn&rsquo;t be one. The only area that I would agree with minimum wage is in immigration reform, the guest worker program. I&#39;d be 100 percent supportive of a minimum wage -- kind of industry specific, maybe regionally specific -- for guest workers, so that we&#39;re not creating incentives for employers to bring in immigrants to lower the price of labor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In the general economy, you get government involved in making market decisions -- first of all, they&#39;re going to get it wrong. For a minimum wage, you will actually reduce the number of jobs available. What you don&#39;t want to do -- if you&#39;re concerned about poverty, if you&#39;re concerned about providing opportunity -- you don&#39;t want to rip the bottom rung of the ladder of opportunity away from people. And that&rsquo;s what you do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The federal government has so-called guest worker <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/13/new-mexico-green-chile-growers-pushing-guest-worke/?page=all\">programs</a> that allow foreign nationals to fill temporary jobs, both agricultural and non-agricultural.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson did not dispute Feingold&rsquo;s claim. His campaign emailed us a statement that said in part that Johnson worked for minimum wage on his first job and &quot;knows minimum wage laws are here to stay and we should design them to make sure they don&rsquo;t hurt the very people they are designed to help.&quot; Johnson opposes a raise to $15, the statement added, but &quot;does not seek to get rid of the federal minimum wage -- it&#39;s here to stay.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold says Johnson &quot;opposes entirely a federal minimum wage,&quot; except perhaps for &quot;guest workers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may not be a position Johnson has stated often, but when asked in July 2014 whether there should be a federal minimum wage, Johnson said there should not be one, other than perhaps one for guest workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And while he may not be trying to repeal the wage, Johnson didn&rsquo;t dispute the accuracy of Feingold&rsquo;s claim -- that he is against having a federal minimum, except perhaps for guest workers coming in from outside the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Feingold&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-08-19T16:35:29.505880", "ruling_date": "2015-08-27T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Sen.
