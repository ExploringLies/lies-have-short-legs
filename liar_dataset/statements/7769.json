Under a bill proposed by the attorney general&rsquo;s office, the responsibility for making those notifications would move from cities and towns to the state.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDuring an April 11 hearing on the proposal, <a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText13/HouseText13/H5557.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">House bill 5557</a>, there was discussion of the current cost. (We&#39;ve written about one such statement by Special Assistant Attorney General Joee Lindbeck <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2013/may/12/joee-lindbeck/assistant-attorney-general-joee-lindbeck-says-prov/\">in a separate item</a>.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRep. Peter Palumbo, D-Cranston, the bill&#39;s chief sponsor, said the change would save money for municipal government because their notification costs would disappear.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;I know [in] the city of Cranston it&#39;s somewhere between $5,000 and $6,000, I believe, per Level 3 registered offender,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#39;s what it&#39;s costing now to notify the people in the neighborhoods if we have a Level 3 sex offender in there.&quot; Level 3 offenders are regarded as most likely to get into trouble again.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.paroleboard.ri.gov/sexoffender/agree.php\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">The state&#39;s website listing sex offenders</a> shows 52 Level 3 offenders registered in Cranston. If Palumbo&rsquo;s claim were true, the city must be spending a lot of money on notifications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(That doesn&#39;t mean authorities had to make 52 notifications. Police only have to warn residents, schools, community organizations and other groups when an offender moves into the area.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we checked Palumbo&rsquo;s figures with the attorney general&#39;s office, it listed Cranston as having spent just $9,137 for 2011. That would be barely enough for two Level 3 notifications if his numbers were correct.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo we went to Cranston Police Chief Marco Palombo to try to reconcile the numbers. The chief sent us a detailed accounting.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2011, the department sent out notifications for seven Level 2 and four Level 3 sex offenders at a total cost of $7,203. (The chief said the $9,137 figure included registration costs.) &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBased on the accounting, that averages out to $655 per offender. The costs were similar whether the offender was designated Level 2 or Level 3.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo when Representative Palumbo said that it cost between $5,000 and $6,000 to notify people that a registered Level 3 sex offender has moved into a Cranston neighborhood, his estimate was about eight times too high.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate the claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">False</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
