The next day, Rubio was asked about it at the CNBC Republican debate in Boulder, Colo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla asked Rubio about the editorial and if he hated his job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio countered that the <em>Sun Sentinel </em>had showed &quot;bias&quot; in its endorsements, because a few other senators who ran for president had missed a huge chunk of votes, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes. I don&#39;t recall them calling for his resignation. &hellip; Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes. In fact, the <em>Sun Sentinel</em> endorsed him. In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again. So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What was the voting record of Sens. Obama, Kerry and Graham when they ran for president? We decided to check the roll call, as well as the endorsement record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Playing hooky</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2008, <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/barack_obama/400629\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Obama</u></a> missed 137 out of 213 votes, or 64.3 percent of votes. (His career absentee rate is 24.2 percent.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2004, <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/john_kerry/300060\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Kerry</u></a> missed 89.8 percent of votes. (His career rate is 7.7 percent.) That&#39;s somewhat higher than what Rubio said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From January to October 2003, which includes the span of his campaign, <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/bob_graham/300046\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Graham</u></a> was absent 37 percent of the time. (His career rate is 3.2 percent.)&nbsp;Graham also underwent <a href=\"http://staugustine.com/stories/020103/sta_1297248.shtml#.VjIoBberQy4\">heart surgery</a>&nbsp;on Jan. 31 that year, which caused him to miss votes before his official campaign launch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For his part, Rubio has missed 99 out of 291 votes (about 34 percent) from the start of the year to Oct. 22, more than any other candidate in the race, according to <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/marco_rubio/412491\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Govtrack.us</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio recently took the &quot;most truant career&quot; sash from Texas Sen.

was only a candidate for a few months. He filed his papers to form a president campaign committee Feb. 27, 2003, launched his campaign May 6 and dropped out Oct. 6, 2003. We couldn&rsquo;t find the <em>Sun Sentinel </em>criticizing his voting record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October 2004, the <a href=\"http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-10-17/news/0410141103_1_iraq-al-qaida-bush-administration\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Sun Sentinel </u><u>endorsed Kerry:</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Massachusetts senator possesses a prodigious intellect capable of grasping the complexities of the serious issues facing the nation and the world,&quot; the <em>Sentinel </em>wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Sentinel&rsquo;s </em>editorial page editor Rosemary O&rsquo;Hara, who joined board in 2012, told PolitiFact that as far as Rubio&rsquo;s endorsement &quot;We believed him when he said he wanted to work for Floridians in the Senate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Clinton and Obama were criticized when they ran for president for missing votes, &quot;I don&#39;t recall either of them complaining about the job,&quot; O&rsquo;Hara told PolitiFact. &quot;By contrast, Sen. Rubio has made it clear he doesn&#39;t like the job, which is why he wants another. Also, Sen. Obama and Clinton were not the senators from Florida. Marco Rubio is our guy. We have a personal relationship with him. We have only two people representing us in the U.S. Senate, and he said he wanted to do the job.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said that Obama &quot;missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes,&quot; that Kerry missed &quot;close to 60 to 70 percent&quot; and that Graham missed &quot;over 30 percent of his votes&quot; when they were running for president. Those numbers check out, though Obama&rsquo;s and Kerry&rsquo;s numbers were over the course of an election year. Rubio is also correct that the newspaper didn&rsquo;t call for their resignations. Overall, we rate Rubio&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Correction:&nbsp;</strong>This report has been updated to correct minor math errors in the calculations of voting percentages.
