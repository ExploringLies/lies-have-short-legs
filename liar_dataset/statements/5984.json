Here&rsquo;s part of the conversation:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Man 1:</strong> &quot;Well, Barrett voted to ban 15 different kinds of guns, even a lot of common deer rifles.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Man 2:</strong> &quot;I love my deer rifle. Barrett voted to ban &lsquo;em?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Man 1:</strong> &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin&#39;s gun deer hunting <a href=\"http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/hunt/dates.html\">season</a> is months away, but you can bet the hundreds of thousands of hunters in the Badger State took notice of the NRA&#39;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs it on target?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo back its claim, the NRA cited Barrett&#39;s 1994 <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1994/roll156.xml\">vote </a>to <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c103:H.R.4296.EH:/\">ban</a> the manufacture, sale and new ownership of 19 semiautomatic assault-style weapons. The measure was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, who said the guns &quot;were designed to kill people&quot; and &quot;had no place on a deer hunt.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe law contained provisions, however, allowing sales of the guns to continue. And the law expired in 2004, after Republican leaders in Congress refused to consider renewing it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong the weapons covered by the law were semiautomatic rifles that had &quot;an ability to accept a detachable magazine&quot; and at least two of these characteristics: &quot;folding or telescoping stock; a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon; a bayonet mount; a flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to accommodate a flash suppressor; and a grenade launcher.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoes this apply to &quot;a lot of common deer rifles&quot; as the ad claims?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>NRA&rsquo;s evidence</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNRA research director John Frazer cited five newspaper and magazine articles from the late 1980s and early 1990s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> reported that the Soviet-model AK-47 assault rifle was becoming more popular with hunters in that area, including deer hunters. One gun shop owner was quoted as saying hunters had been using military-style semi-automatic rifles since before World War II. The <em>Houston Post</em> reported that, according to local gun shop managers, it was not uncommon for Texans to hunt with semiautomatic rifles. That article didn&rsquo;t indicate, however, whether the specific guns targeted in the ban were commonly used for deer hunting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn a national scale, <em>American Hunter</em> magazine praised the Heckler &amp; Koch 91 as a hunting rifle for deer and other game, but didn&rsquo;t indicate whether it was popular among deer hunters. In fact, the writer said the gun might be a &quot;&lsquo;black sheep&rsquo; to traditionalists.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSimilarly, <em>American Rifleman</em> praised a particular type of AK-47 ammunition for hunting white-tail deer, but didn&rsquo;t discuss whether the gun itself was common among deer hunters. The magazine later reported, though, that &quot;hundreds of thousands of shooters and hunters,&quot; including whitetail deer hunters, were using another gun covered by the ban, the AR-15.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, there&rsquo;s an indication that some deer hunters used the weapons targeted by the ban, but none of the articles was specific to Wisconsin. The NRA&rsquo;s claim was broad in nature, but its ad is aimed at Wisconsin voters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Wisconsin experts</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted three Wisconsin gun deer hunting experts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEach said flatly that the banned weapons were not commonly used for deer hunting when the ban became law in 1994.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe experts were Tim Lawhern, administrator of the enforcement division of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the state agency that oversees deer hunting; Mark Toso, president of the <a href=\"http://www.wideerhunters.org/\">Wisconsin Deer Hunters Association</a> and Paul A. Smith, outdoors editor of the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentine</em>l. Each has more than 30 years of experience hunting deer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLawhern, who taught DNR hunter safety classes for 18 years, recalled that when he worked in the field in the mid-1990s he would see perhaps half a dozen hunters each season using an assault-style weapon.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tToso -- who said he recently ended his longtime NRA membership in opposition to many of the group&rsquo;s political messages -- called the percentage of gun deer hunters using weapons covered by the ban &quot;tiny&quot; at the time of the ban. (His association has not made an endorsement in the governor&rsquo;s race.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Smith said that from his experience, while firearms such as the AK-47 and the AR-15 &quot;have gained favor among some hunters and sport shooters in recent decades, they constitute a small fraction of deer hunting rifles in use today and were an even smaller fraction in 1994.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe NRA said Barrett voted to ban &quot;a lot of common deer rifles.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statement holds an element of truth in that some deer hunters used some of the weapons. But the statement ignores facts that create a different impression. Experts agreed that the once-banned weapons were not commonly used for deer hunting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(You can comment on this item on the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/politifact-testing-nra-claim-barrett-voted-to-ban-common-deer-rifles-ti5iac5-155342665.html\">Journal Sentinel&#39;s web page</a>).</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-25T14:45:46.899291", "ruling_date": "2012-05-29T09:14:31", "ruling_headline": "In Wisconsin recall, NRA says Dem challenger Tom Barrett voted to ban deer hunting guns", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-recall-nra-says-dem-challenger-tom-barre", "ruling_link_text": "Banned guns not widely used for deer hunting (then or now)", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWisPolitics.com, National Rifle Association &quot;Think again&quot; <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/1006/NRA_ThinkAgain_mix1.mp3\">radio ad</a>, posted May 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview and email interview, NRA Institute for Legislative Action research director John Frazer, May 22, 23 and 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Tom Barrett campaign spokesman Phil Walzak, May 21, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssociated Press, &quot;Clinton urges hunters to help ban assault weapons,&quot; April 30, 1994<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, &quot;Barrett rips Congress on weapons ban lapse,&quot; Sept. 14, 2004<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJohn Pitta, Congressional testimony, April 25, 1994<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. House of Representatives, <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1994/roll156.xml\">vote</a> on assault weapons ban, May 5, 1994<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLibrary of Congress, assault weapons ban <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c103:H.R.4296.EH:/\">bill</a>, passed May 5, 1994<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, <a href=\"http://wsfrprograms.fws.gov/Subpages/NationalSurvey/nat_survey2006_final.pdf\">&quot;2006 national survey of fishing, hunting and wildlife-associated recreation&quot; </a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, <a href=\"http://www.wideerhunters.org/\">Wisconsin Deer Hunters Association</a> president Mark Toso, May 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources division of enforcement and science administrator Tim Lawhern, May 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel outdoors editor Paul A.
