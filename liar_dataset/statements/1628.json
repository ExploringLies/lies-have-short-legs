For goodness' sake, on the day that their state leader resigned in disgrace, a 'Shred-It' truck rolled up to Republican headquarters.\"<br /><br />At PolitiFact Florida, we wanted to thoroughly analyze Grayson's claim about the Guinness Book of World Records. But alas, there is no \"Most Consecutive Cliche\" category.

Charlie Crist, <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/article1063238.ece\" target=\"_blank\">resigned under pressure</a> from big GOP donors Jan. 5, 2010, after a <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2009/12/17/1385739/florida-gop-chairman-fights-efforts.html\" target=\"_blank\">series of stories</a> documented <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/article1059384.ece\" target=\"_blank\">troubled spending patterns</a> of <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2009/.../some-republicans-see-state-gop.html\" target=\"_blank\">state party political donations</a>. Greer suggested he was a victim of a witch hunt.<br /><br />On the day he resigned, reporters working in Tallahassee did notice a white \"Shred-It\" truck parked outside RPOF headquarters. Indeed, it was a <a href=\"http://www.shredit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">mobile paper shredding company</a>.<br /><br />Whitney Ray of the Capitol News Service filed the first report that day:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"It was a quiet and somber day outside the Republican Party of Florida headquarters, the only noise was traffic, and the sound of a paper shredding truck.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"The driver came out wheeling an empty cart and a blue bag, one hour before embattled chairman Jim Greer made this announcement, on a conference call with reporters.\"</p>\r\n<p>A party spokeswoman said the timing of the Shred-It visit was just a coincidence. The mobile shredder comes monthly and just happened to coincide with the day Greer was announcing his resignation.<br /><br />But there was the <a href=\"http://www.flanews.com/?p=8249\" target=\"_blank\">image</a> nevertheless.<br /><br />In mocking Republicans and his new Tea Party challenger, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson said that on the day the state party chairman resigned, \"a 'Shred-It' truck rolled up to Republican headquarters.\" It did.
