Nearly 360,000 federal troops were killed during the war. About 160,000 Confederate soldiers perished.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio checked the historical society&rsquo;s Civil War pages and found other notable points from Ohio&rsquo;s role in the Civil War:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tWhen President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 recruits in April 1861, Ohio&#39;s quota was 13,000. Sixteen days after Lincoln&rsquo;s call for troops, enough Ohioans had volunteered to meet the full national requirement. More than 100,200 men enlisted that year.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe more than 300,000 Ohioans who served in war represent the third largest total from any Union State. (In the 1860 Census, Ohio was the third most populous state, behind New York and Pennsylvania, which were Nos. 1 and 2 for providing troops.)</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tAmong those who served from Ohio, more than 200 reached the rank of general, including several Confederate generals.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tFive veterans of the war with links to Ohio became president. The state lays partial claim to Ulysses Grant, who was elected from Illinois, and Benjamin Harrison, who was elected from Indiana. They were both born in Ohio. Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield and William McKinley all served with Ohio units and were elected president as Ohioans.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\tFaber&rsquo;s claim was that more than 300,000 Ohioans served in the Civil War and that the per capita enlistment was the highest in the nation.
