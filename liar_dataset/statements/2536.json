A notable exception is the &quot;Fair Tax Act,&quot; introduced most recently by Republican congressman John Linder of Georgia.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe legislation specifically calls for abolishing most federal taxes - including personal and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, and estate and gift taxes - and replacing them with a national sales tax on private consumption, home interest payments and government spending. It would have a rate of 23 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBackers say the plan would be progressive on consumption and increase savings and investment. Opponents say it would be regressive and increase taxes on middle-income earners. (Detailed examinations of the proposal can be found in FactCheck.org&rsquo;s &quot;Unspinning the fair tax,&quot; published May 31, 2007, and PolitiFact.com&rsquo;s &quot;Adding up the fair tax,&quot; published Jan. 23, 2008.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPromoted by such groups as Texas-based Americans for Fair Taxation the <a href=\"http://www.ohfairtax.org/\">Ohio FairTax Association</a>, the proposal has been embraced by many in the Tea Party movement, whose &quot;Contract from America&quot; supports a &quot;single-rate tax system.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Ohio Democratic Party says the plan is supported by Tom Ganley, the Republican challenging Rep. Betty Sutton in the 13th Congressional District. The claim is posted as a fact on <a href=\"http://therealtomganley.com/\">a website paid for by the Democratic party</a> that Sutton-authorized:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Tom Ganley supports a 23 percent national sales tax that would raise taxes on the middle class while giving a huge tax break to millionaires like himself.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJust one problem: Ganley&#39;s campaign says he does not support the FairTax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat got <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/\">PolitiFact Ohio</a>&rsquo;s curiosity going. Does he or doesn&#39;t he? The answer rests on the fine line between &quot;support&quot; and &quot;supportive.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSutton&#39;s campaign cites a survey of candidates that was posted in May by Ohioans for the FairTax. It has Ganley&#39;s position checked in the category of &quot;favorable/supports.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSteven Curtis, the group&#39;s state director, said the listing was based on discussion with Ganley&#39;s campaign staff. &quot;They told me he was supportive,&quot; Curtis said. &quot;They told me he was favorably inclined toward the FairTax.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat echoes a member&rsquo;s posting on the <a href=\"http://www.fairtaxnation.com/\">Fair Tax Nation</a> website last November, after Ganley spoke to a breakfast meeting during the Senate run he left for the congressional race: &quot;His PR man said Tom is very supportive of the Fair Tax.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSutton also points to a statement by Ganley on <a href=\"http://www.tomganley.com/\">his own website</a>: &quot;We need to consider basing our tax structure on alternate tax methodologies such as the Fair Tax and others which can be utilized to help people invest and save.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGanley spokeswoman Meghan Snyder said that the call for consideration does not constitute support.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The current system is broken and ideas such as the Fair Tax and Flat Tax are on the table for consideration, but Mr. Ganley has not endorsed either plan,&quot; she said in an emailed statement. &quot;Though there are many proposed solutions, lowering taxes to grow the private sector will ultimately help bring our country back to prosperity.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGanley has called for &quot;fair taxes,&quot; but we could not find his &quot;supportive&quot; position on the Fair Tax &nbsp;plan, or his stated openness to it, translating into a direct endorsement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo there&rsquo;s a shred of truth to the claim. He has called for the Fair Tax to be considered, but:<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tBut to carry that point further to say he has thrown his support behind it is an overstatement.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tNot explaining that it is one possibility he said should be looked at fails to raise critical facts that could give readers a different impression.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tAnd classifying it as a tax that would &quot;raise taxes on the middle class while giving a huge tax break to millionaires like himself&quot; adds in a dose of political hyperbole.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate this claim Barely True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/10/ohio_democratic_party_charges.html\" target=\"blank\">Comment on this item</a>.</p>\r\n\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
