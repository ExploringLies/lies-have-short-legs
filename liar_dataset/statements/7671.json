The group does not want the insurance industry to lose a tax break it has enjoyed for more than three decades. Here&rsquo;s the transcript:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s the working tax cut that creates jobs -- over 40,000 new jobs in just the last four years. Major employers are moving to Florida and hiring. That&#39;s growth our economy needs. But now some in Tallahassee want to end it and make it harder and more expensive to create jobs. It doesn&#39;t make sense. Say no to Senate Bill <a href=\"http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2013/1832\">1832</a>. Keep the working tax cut. Keep the jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe ad ignores the real keywords of this debate, which are &quot;insurance companies&quot; and &quot;motor vehicle registration fees.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;Working tax cut&quot; is a euphemism for &quot;taxpayer-subsidized premium tax credit.&quot; Since 1987, insurance companies use a 15 percent premium tax credit for Florida-based employees, excluding insurance agents.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe Senate&rsquo;s chief budget-writer, Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, proposed eliminating the tax credit in exchange for rolling back the Legislature&rsquo;s 2009 hike on motor vehicle registration fees, a move that will save vehicle owners $12 a year.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe wondered what evidence AIF had to support its claim that this 26-year-old tax cut created 40,000 jobs in the last four years.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Debunking the jobs number</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAIF&rsquo;s public relations consultant, Bascom Communications and Consulting, directed us to <a href=\"http://www.floir.com/siteDocuments/2009AnnualReport.pdf\">2009 </a>and <a href=\"http://www.floir.com/siteDocuments/2011AnnualReport.pdf\">2011 </a>reports about the state&rsquo;s insurance industry by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (the 2012 report is not out yet). The reports run a year or two behind for job estimates for the industry. The <a href=\"http://www.floir.com/siteDocuments/2011AnnualReport.pdf\">2011 annual report</a> references 2010 jobs data, and the <a href=\"http://www.floir.com/siteDocuments/2009AnnualReport.pdf\">2009 report</a> includes 2007 jobs data.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAccording to state reports, the insurance industry accounted for 144,184 jobs in Florida in 2007 and grew to 188,290 in 2010. Boom, AIF says, 44,106 new insurance jobs created.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tNot so fast. This picture of dramatic jobs growth is not supported by evidence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe state reports cited by AIF say their jobs data is backed up by two sources: the Bureau of Economic Analysis, run by the U.S. Department of Commerce; and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, run by the U.S. Department of Labor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tState insurance regulators were still collecting information about how it compiles its data by our deadline. It appears, though, that the dramatic jobs growth AIF is crowing about is the result of the state using two very different starting places to calculate job growth.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere&#39;s what most likely happened:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe state&#39;s count for insurance jobs in 2007 (the 144,184 number) is backed by <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&amp;step=30&amp;isuri=1&amp;7028=1004&amp;7040=-1&amp;7083=levels&amp;7025=0&amp;7022=5&amp;7023=0&amp;7024=naics&amp;7029=31&amp;7026=12000&amp;7027=2011,2010,2009,2008,2007,2006,2005,2004,2003,2002,2001,2000&amp;7001=45&amp;7031=0&amp;7090=70&amp;7033=-1#reqid=70&amp;step=30&amp;isuri=1&amp;7028=1004&amp;7040=-1&amp;7083=levels&amp;7029=31&amp;7022=5&amp;7023=0&amp;7024=naics&amp;7025=0&amp;7026=12000&amp;7027=2011,2010,2009,2008,2007,2006,2005,2004,2003,2002,2001,2000&amp;7001=45&amp;7031=0&amp;7090=70&amp;7033=-1\">BEA jobs data</a> for full- and part-time wage and salary employees, excluding proprietors and general partners.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut the 2010 state number <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&amp;step=30&amp;isuri=1&amp;7028=1004&amp;7040=-1&amp;7083=levels&amp;7031=0&amp;7030=0&amp;7022=4&amp;7023=0&amp;7024=naics&amp;7025=0&amp;7026=12000&amp;7027=2011,2010,2009,2008,2007,2006,2005,2004,2003,2002,2001,2000,1999,1998,1997,1996,1995,1994,1993,1992,1991,1990&amp;7001=44&amp;7029=30&amp;7090=70&amp;7033=-1#reqid=70&amp;step=30&amp;isuri=1&amp;7040=-1&amp;7083=levels&amp;7031=0&amp;7030=0&amp;7001=44&amp;7022=4&amp;7023=0&amp;7024=naics&amp;7025=0&amp;7026=12000&amp;7027=2011,2010,2009,2008,2007,2006,2005,2004,2003,2002,2001,2000,1999,1998,1997,1996,1995,1994,1993,1992,1991,1990&amp;7028=1004&amp;7029=30&amp;7090=70&amp;7033=-1\">relied on a different calculation</a>, one that <em>includes </em>proprietors and general partners.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIt&#39;s a significant difference.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAn apples-to-apples comparison of job growth -- whether or not you include proprietors and general partners -- shows that the state actually lost insurance industry jobs between 2007 and 2010.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe&#39;ll say that again. If the state compared the same set of data -- either one -- they would have found that the state lost insurance industry jobs between 2007 and 2010.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBLS <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjR_9M-1WtJTdGYxVnFFdGJJMGltdFhzVGhkcF9Mc2c&amp;usp=sharing\">data</a> does not help, either.

Several Republican senators were skeptical, saying the Legislature had historically worked to improve the business climate for the insurance industry and too many years had passed since the tax incentive was reviewed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tRepealing the insurance tax credit would bring about $230 million to state coffers each year, which would pay for reducing motor vehicle fees, according to a committee analysis.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;Not only will this bill rid our state of an antiquated government subsidy for the insurance industry, but, more importantly, it will keep money in the pockets of our hard-working taxpayers,&quot; said Senate President Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, in a statement.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAIF rolled out a big ad campaign to combat SB 1832, saying the insurance industry&rsquo;s &quot;working tax cut&quot;
