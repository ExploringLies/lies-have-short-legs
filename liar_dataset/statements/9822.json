Some liberals say Obama has been too silent on the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an Aug. 25&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2014/08/24/cornel_west_he_posed_as_a_progressive_and_turned_out_to_be_counterfeit_we_ended_up_with_a_wall_street_presidency_a_drone_presidency/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview</u></a> with <em>Salon,</em> ultra-liberal African-American professor<strong> </strong>Cornel West blasted Obama &nbsp;for posing as a progressive while actually being a &quot;counterfeit&quot; centrist<em>. </em>Obama&rsquo;s need to find the middle ground, West argued, is apparent in his recent handling of the Ferguson protests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Obama administration has been silent. Completely silent,&quot; West said. &quot;All of a sudden now, you get this uprising and what is the response? Well, as we know, you send out a statement on the death of brother Robin Williams before you sent out a statement on brother Michael Brown.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if Obama commented on Williams&rsquo; death before he addressed Brown&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A tale of two statements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s important to note that the two deaths are hardly similar. Williams was a worldwide&nbsp;celebrity and news of his death quickly spread. His death did not spark protests or involve questions of police misconduct. Statements from political leaders and the White House when celebrities die&nbsp;are often fast and received without controversy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown, meanwhile, was mostly an unknown figure to the world when he was killed Aug. 9, and it&nbsp;took time for the story of his death to spread.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<em>New York Times,&nbsp;</em>for instance did not put a story about Brown or the city of Ferguson on its front page until Aug. 12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as comparisons go, West&nbsp;has his facts correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/11/president-obama-passing-robin-williams-he-was-one-kind\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>issued</u></a> a statement hours after Williams&rsquo; death was announced by police officials on Aug. 11. In his statement, Obama praised the late actor as &quot;one of a kind&quot; and offered his condolences to Williams&rsquo; loved ones and well-wishers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He arrived in our lives as an alien -- but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit,&quot; Obama wrote. &quot;He made us laugh. He made us cry. He gave his immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most -- from our troops stationed abroad to the marginalized on our own streets.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown was shot at noon Central Time on Aug. 9, and news broke of the police-involved shooting that afternoon. Obama, who was on vacation in Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard at the time, did not <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/08/12/president-obama-issues-statement-death-michael-brown\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>release </u></a>a statement until Aug. 12, three days after Brown&rsquo;s death. That&rsquo;s also one day after his statement about Williams. Obama said that Brown&rsquo;s passing was &quot;heartbreaking&quot; and offered his and Michelle&rsquo;s condolences to Brown&rsquo;s family and community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I urge everyone in Ferguson, Mo., and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,&quot; Obama wrote. &quot;We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that&rsquo;s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his statement, Obama alluded to an earlier statement made by Holder. Holder&rsquo;s statement, which did not mention Brown by name and largely discussed the role of federal investigations, was released on Aug. 11 -- two days after Brown&rsquo;s death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Seen but can&rsquo;t be heard</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Aug. 22, a New York Times<em>/</em>CBS <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/22/us/politics/racial-divide-seen-in-response-to-ferguson-unrest-poll-finds.html?_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>poll</u></a> reported that 60 percent of African-Americans were satisfied with Obama&rsquo;s response, compared to 35 percent of whites. But Obama&rsquo;s words and actions around Brown have been targeted by conservatives, liberals and netizens alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A day after Brown&rsquo;s shooting, an <a href=\"https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/issue-statement-killings-mike-brown-john-crawford-and-jeremy-lake-and-demand-congressional-action/6kbxSPJd\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>online petition</u></a> was launched, calling for Obama to issue a statement on the deaths of Brown and two other black men, and to demand congressional action.
