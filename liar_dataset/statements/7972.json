Ed Lindsey of Buckhead, one of the four major announced candidates for Georgia&rsquo;s 11th Congressional District seat, accused fellow Republican candidate Bob Barr of waffling in his position on DOMA over the years.

Given Bob&rsquo;s gymnastic changes in his position on DOMA over the years, we do not know what his position was on traditional marriage in 2004, but I campaigned for it then and I will stay the course for my constituents now.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tHas Barr changed his position on DOMA over the years?

On the day of the ruling, Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens made it clear that Georgia&rsquo;s definition of marriage, as that between a man and woman, <a href=\"http://law.ga.gov/press-releases/2013-06-26/statement-attorney-general-olens-supreme-court%E2%80%99s-doma-decision\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">would stand</a>. (In 2004, about 76 percent of Georgia voters approved a constitutional amendment <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/ballot.measures/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">banning</a> same-sex marriage.)</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tOn the same day as the court decision, Barr -- a former federal prosecutor and a former member of Georgia&rsquo;s congressional delegation -- released his own statement about the DOMA ruling on his Facebook page:</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\t&quot;I personally believe marriage should be defined as between one man and one woman and, if it were on the ballot in Georgia, I&#39;d vote that way. However, I have come to believe that it&#39;s yet one more example of the federal government&#39;s delving into areas that throughout our history have been best left to the states. I trust the judgement of the people of Georgia more than that of Washington, D.C.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tWe checked with Lindsey&rsquo;s campaign spokesman, who said his candidate&rsquo;s criticism of Barr was a reference to Barr&rsquo;s Facebook statement. Lindsey&rsquo;s statement also seems to play to the 11th District&rsquo;s conservative base by making a pointed jab at Barr and reminding voters of Barr&rsquo;s past <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/aclu-announces-collaboration-rep-bob-barr-says-conservative-congressman-will-\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">consulting work</a> with the liberal-leaning American Civil Liberties Union.

Barr, then a Republican, was still fresh in his congressional tenure, which stretched from 1995 to 2003. Then-President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law in September 1996.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tYears later, after leaving Washington and switching his party affiliation, Barr <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2013/06/26/doma-author-bob-barr-clams-up-about-supreme-court-decision\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">apologized</a> for his role in DOMA&rsquo;s passage. At the May 2008 Libertarian National Convention, Barr said to the audience: &quot;Standing before you, looking you in the eye, the Defense of Marriage Act -- in so far as it provided the federal government a club to club down the rights of law-abiding American citizens -- has been abused, misused and should be repealed, and I will work to repeal that.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tIn 2009, Barr called for DOMA to be repealed. In a Los Angeles Times <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-barr5-2009jan05,0,1855836.story\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">editorial</a>, Barr said, &quot;I have concluded that DOMA is neither meeting the principles of federalism it was supposed to, nor is its impact limited to federal law.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tTwo years later, in an<a href=\"http://www.advocate.com/news/news-features/2011/05/03/bob-barr-doma?page=0,1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> interview</a> posted on the national gay and lesbian news magazine website Advocate.com, Barr said DOMA had become &quot;the tail wagging the dog&quot; and that the eventual goal was to &quot;get the government out of the marriage business.&quot; </p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tWhen he announced his congressional candidacy this time around, Barr <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/political-insider/2013/mar/28/bob-barr-author-doma-enters-gop-race-11th-district/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">told </a>an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter in March: &quot;The federal government has become so big, so intrusive ... we really need to start pulling that back.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tBarr has not directly commented on the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling to us or <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2013/06/26/doma-author-bob-barr-clams-up-about-supreme-court-decision\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">other media outlets</a>. Through a spokesman, Barr said he stands by his Facebook post on the issue. &quot;Some believe in a top-down approach from Washington on every issue that faces this country. The conservative approach, Bob&rsquo;s approach, is to let the people of the states decide these issues for themselves,&quot; Barr&rsquo;s spokesman told us in an email message.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tSo does Lindsey&rsquo;s claim live happily ever after?</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tCongressional candidate Ed Lindsey said former congressman and DOMA author Bob Barr has changed his position on DOMA over the years. </p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tBarr guided DOMA to passage as a Republican in the mid-1990s. But then Barr became a Libertarian and apologized for his role in getting the bill passed. As a Libertarian, Barr has said DOMA has been used by the government to overstep its authority. </p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tNow, seeking office as a Republican, Barr says he has come to understand that this is a matter for states to handle.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tBarr has refused to directly comment on the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision last week striking down a part of DOMA.
