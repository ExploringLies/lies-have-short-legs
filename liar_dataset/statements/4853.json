Mitt Romney as a serial flip-flopper. The shorter, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUOM9QvhG5I&amp;feature=player_embedded\">30-second version</a> gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with a <a href=\"http://www.mittvmitt.com/\">four-minute version</a> that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tFor this item, we&rsquo;ll check one of the claims from the four-minute version -- specifically, whether Romney has changed his position on President Barack Obama&rsquo;s stimulus plan, officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. We&#39;re looking at other aspects of the ad in separate items.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the relevant portion from the DNC ad:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>On-screen text</strong>: &quot;Opposed the stimulus&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Video clip of Romney</strong>: &quot;I have never supported the president&#39;s Recovery Act, alright -- the stimulus. No time, nowhere, nohow.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>On-screen text</strong>: &quot;After he was for it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Different video clip of Romney</strong>: &quot;I think there is need for economic stimulus.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked the DNC for citations for these clips, and they responded that the first one <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y05NqZ8cBcI&amp;feature=related\">came from</a> a town hall at St. Anselm College in Goffstown, N.H., on Sept. 28, 2011, and the second one <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttn8dnWBQ0Q\">came from</a> a Romney appearance on CNN&rsquo;s <em>Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer </em>on Jan. 4, 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUpon learning this, we immediately noticed that the CNN interview -- when Romney said, &quot;I think there is need for economic stimulus&quot; -- took place before Obama had even been sworn into office and therefore came before there was an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo get the full context of the CNN interview, we looked to the <a href=\"http://www-cgi.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0901/04/le.01.html\">transcript</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBlitzer said that Obama, then president-elect, was &quot;talking about a $750 billion economic stimulus package. He wants it to be passed as soon as possible. It&#39;s unclear if whether it can be passed before he&#39;s inaugurated on January 20th. What do you think about this proposal?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney replied, &quot;Well, I frankly wish that the last Congress (had) dealt with the stimulus issue and that the president could have signed that before leaving office. I think there is need for economic stimulus. Americans have lost about $11 trillion in net worth. That translates into about $400 billion a year less spending that they&#39;ll be doing, and that&#39;s net of additional government programs like Medicaid and unemployment insurance. And government can help make that up in a very difficult time. And that&#39;s one of the reasons why I think a stimulus program is needed.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe continued, &quot;I&#39;d move quickly. These are unusual times. But it has to be something which relieves pressure on middle-income families. I think a tax cut is necessary for them as well as for businesses that are growing. We&#39;ll be investing in infrastructure and in energy technologies. But let&#39;s not make this a Christmas tree of all of the favors for various politicians who have helped out the Obama campaign, giving them special projects. That would be wrong. You&#39;ll see Republicans fight that tooth and nail if that happens. Let&#39;s do what&#39;s right for the economy, and let&#39;s not do what&#39;s a political expedient move.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe DNC ad has some support for its flip-flop claim. Romney did indeed say, &quot;I think there is need for economic stimulus,&quot; and at the time of the interview, there was in fact an outline of a stimulus plan from Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it&rsquo;s misleading to say Romney flip-flopped on supporting &quot;the president&#39;s Recovery Act.&quot; At the time of the CNN interview, no Obama stimulus bill had been introduced, much less enacted. With such complex bills, the devil&rsquo;s in the details. Given that Romney outlined a whole list of conditions he&rsquo;d impose on such a bill, we think it&rsquo;s unfair for the DNC to say Romney once supported &quot;the president&#39;s Recovery Act.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the CNN interview, Romney expressed support broadly for &quot;economic stimulus&quot; -- not for a specific measure known as &quot;the president&#39;s Recovery Act.&quot; And even as he offered his support for the concept of stimulus, Romney articulated a pretty specific vision of the kind of bill he&rsquo;d support. Some of this vision did ultimately overlap with what the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act offered -- tax relief for &quot;middle-income families&quot; and businesses, for instance, and investments in infrastructure and energy. But Romney&rsquo;s two comments can be easily reconciled by arguing that the dollar amounts in the Obama stimulus bill -- or the ratios of various provisions in the bill -- went beyond what he was envisioning. We rate the DNC&rsquo;s charge of flip-flopping Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-28T16:36:44.399200", "ruling_date": "2011-11-28T17:51:49", "ruling_headline": "DNC ad says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on Obama stimulus", "ruling_headline_slug": "dnc-ad-says-mitt-romney-flip-flopped-obama-stimulu", "ruling_link_text": "Romney supported the concept of stimulus, not specific Obama plan", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tDemocratic National Committee, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.mittvmitt.com/\">Mitt v.
