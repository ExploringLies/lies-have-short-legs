Governor Ralph Northam - are to blame for essentially encouraging the murder of these police officers tonight,&quot; Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stewart.corey?fref=ts\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>wrote</u></a> in a Facebook post shortly after midnight on July 8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re not fact-checking Stewart&rsquo;s opinion that comments from &quot;liberal politicians&quot; triggered the Dallas shootings by a man who was upset by recent police killings of blacks in other cities. Our focus is investigating Stewart&rsquo;s claim that Clinton and Northam have labeled police as racists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stewart has rivalries with both Democrats. As Trump&rsquo;s state chairman, he has a major role in trying to defeat Clinton this fall in Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next year, Stewart plans to seek the GOP gubernatorial nomination. That puts him at cross-purposes with Northam, who is the only announced Democratic gubernatorial candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stewart doubled down on his statement in a follow-up Facebook post that said: &quot;Va. Lt. Governor Ralph Northam and Hillary Clinton are pitting minorities against the police. Whenever there is a police shooting involving a minority, their knee jerk reaction is to allege racism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s campaign quickly distanced itself from Stewart&rsquo;s statement that &quot;liberal politicians&quot; caused the Dallas shooting. &quot;Corey does not speak for the campaign, and this is not something we agree with,&quot; Hope Hicks, Trump&rsquo;s campaign spokeswoman, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/live/news-dallas-shooting-protest/trump-campaign-official-blames-hillary-clinton-for-shootings/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>told</u></a> The New York Times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stewart&rsquo;s social media posts don&rsquo;t cite any comments by Clinton or Northam. So we asked Stewart to point us to specific statements by the two Democrats that prove both &quot;label police as racists.&quot; He declined our request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also reached out to the Republican Party of Virginia, to see if it&rsquo;s aware of any comments that would back Stewart&rsquo;s claim. The party didn&rsquo;t provide any.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Not our statement,&quot; David D&rsquo;Onofrio, a party spokesman, wrote in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we looked on our own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clinton</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After police fatally shot two black men this month - Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La., and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minn. - Clinton tweeted, &quot;Alton Sterling Matters, Philando Castile Matters. Black Lives Matter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She attached a statement to her tweet: &quot;Something is profoundly wrong when so many Americans have reason to believe that our country doesn&rsquo;t consider them as precious as others because of the color of their skin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Jan. 16 primary debate, NBC News anchor Lester Holt <a href=\"http://time.com/4183952/democratic-debate-full-text-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>asked</u></a> Clinton about the 2015 fatal shooting of Walter Scott, a black man who was running away from a police officer in North Charleston, S.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified. But it played straight to the fears of many African-American men that their lives are cheap. Is that perception, or in your view is it reality?&quot; Holt asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUJqvu9QLnI\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>said</u></a> that, sadly, that is a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system,&quot; she said. &quot;And that requires a very clear agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the eve of South Carolina&rsquo;s Democratic Primary in February, Clinton released a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/us/politics/hillary-clinton-criminal-justice-ad.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>TV ad</u></a> in which she lamented a &quot;fundamentally broken&quot; system where &quot;African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said in the ad, &quot;We have to face up to the hard truth of injustice and systemic racism.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Clinton&rsquo;s campaign if it sees a distinction between her comments about &quot;systemic racism&quot; and Stewart&rsquo;s claim that she labels police as racists. Sarah Peck, a Virginia spokeswoman for the campaign, sent us a series of Clinton statements this year voicing broad support for police officers. Here are a few:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think the vast majority of police officers in our country are serving honorably and bravely, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s very important we support their work. That we respect their service,&quot; Clinton <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/clinton-calls-greater-respect-cops-force-guidelines-40446575\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>said</u></a> during a July 8 interview with &quot;ABC World News Tonight.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think that most law enforcement is doing an excellent job. They are honorable, they&rsquo;re working hard. But we don&rsquo;t want to taint everybody with the problems that some have,&quot; she said during a Feb. 12 <a href=\"http://wspa.com/2016/02/12/hillary-clinton-announces-jobs-plan-in-sc/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview</u></a> with WSPA-TV in Spartanburg, S.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now I think you know, because I sure believe, there are many police officers out there every day inspiring trust and confidence, putting themselves on the line to save lives. So let&#39;s learn from those who are doing it right and apply those lessons across the country,&quot; she said during a Feb. 16 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzvF-zrxAds\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>speech</u></a> in Harlem, N.Y.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has called for improved police training to combat &quot;implicit bias.&quot; She also wants to create federal matching grants to help police forces buy body cameras to protect officers from unfair accusations and suspects from mistreatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Northam</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrary to Stewart&rsquo;s claim, we couldn&rsquo;t find any comments by the lieutenant governor that even remotely accused police of racism. We searched the archives of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, The Washington Post, The Virginian-Pilot, The Roanoke Times and the Daily Press. We also combed through Northam&rsquo;s website, his Facebook page and Twitter pages for the lieutenant governor&rsquo;s office and Northam&rsquo;s gubernatorial campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only Northam statement we found on the violence was released shortly after the Dallas shootings and expressed grief felt by the lieutenant governor and his wife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Pam and I are heartbroken over the horrific violence against the police in Dallas,&quot; Northam said in the written statement. &quot;With so much violence and tragedy in Dallas, Minneapolis, and Baton Rouge, this is a time for our nation to come together and heal. Having cared for those who are wounded in service of our country, I know the sacrifice these officers make and my prayers are with the victims, their families, all first responders and all communities affected by violence.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alexsis Rodgers, Northam&rsquo;s policy director and spokeswoman, told us the lieutenant governor&rsquo;s office is perplexed by Stewart&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stewart said that Hillary Clinton and Ralph Northam &quot;label police as racists.&quot; He declined to offer any statements by the two Democrats that would back his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has said racial profiling needs to end and that law enforcement needs to confront &quot;systemic racism&quot; in the criminal justice system. That lends an element of truth to Stewart&rsquo;s statement, but it&rsquo;s a far cry from Clinton labeling all police as racists. Clinton has said repeatedly that the actions of a few officers shouldn&rsquo;t taint all law enforcement officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Northam, we can&rsquo;t find any statement that supports Stewart&rsquo;s incendiary claim, and Stewart dodges his burden of proof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All told, we rate Stewart&rsquo;s statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6eabf830-e0ae-41a5-9009-62513628fbe5\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6eabf830-e0ae-41a5-9009-62513628fbe5</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-25T21:49:07.334237", "ruling_date": "2016-07-26T10:08:52", "ruling_headline": "Corey Stewart misleadingly says Hillary Clinton, Ralph Northam 'label police as racists' ", "ruling_headline_slug": "corey-stewart-wrongly-says-hillary-clinton-ralph-n", "ruling_link_text": "Exaggerated for Clinton; baseless for Northam", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Corey Stewart Facebook page <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stewart.corey?fref=ts\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>post</u></a>, July 8, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Corey Stewart, July 13, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email from David D&rsquo;Onofrio, director of communications for the Republican Party of Virginia, July 14, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email from Sarah Peck, communications director of Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s presidential campaign in Virginia, July 13, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Alexsis Rodgers, policy director for Lt.
