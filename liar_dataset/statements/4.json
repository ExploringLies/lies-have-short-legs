Indeed, much of the job growth in the state began before Richardson became governor, Peach said.\n</p>\n<p>\n Still, Peach said Richardson's tax incentives and income tax cuts have created a favorable atmosphere for business that is a stark change from the state's mentality in the mid-1970s, when state officials refused to provide help to a promising young company named Microsoft.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"The climate here has changed considerably since then,\" Peach said. \"Bill Richardson has been a big part of that.
