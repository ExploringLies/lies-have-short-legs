But you aren&rsquo;t catching the water in buckets, but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner. Eventually, you&rsquo;re going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;WIT is adamant that there&rsquo;s no immediate danger, however. &lsquo;Currently, solar panels are an energy niche, and do not pose a serious risk to the sun. But if we converted our grids to solar energy in a big way, with panels on domestic homes and commercial businesses, and paving our parking lots with panels, we&rsquo;d start seeing very serious problems over time. If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years, and the sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, people passing along this story by email appear not to be aware that the National Report is a satire site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/23/chain-email/rumors-third-barack-obama-term-are-satire-passed-t/\"><u>we noted just a few days ago</u></a> in another check of a National Report piece that went viral, the site&rsquo;s tongue-in-cheek&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nationalreport.net/disclaimer/\"><u>disclaimer</u></a> says, in part, that &quot;the views expressed by writers on this site are theirs alone and are not reflective of the fine journalistic and editorial integrity of National Report.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The urban-legend investigation site&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/satire/thirdterm.asp\"><u>Snopes.com</u></a> has archived an even clearer disclaimer that has since been removed. The former disclaimer&nbsp;<a href=\"http://message.snopes.com/politics/graphics/disclaimer.jpg\"><u>said</u></a>, &quot;National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.&quot; (Snopes also <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/satire/solarpanels.asp\"><u>debunked</u></a> the solar panels story on May 25, 2014.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We checked with a solar energy expert to make sure we weren&rsquo;t missing something, and they agreed that the sun-draining claim is pure hokum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The sun is really big, really far away, and constantly producing mind-boggling amounts of energy through nuclear fusion. It couldn&rsquo;t care less about your puny solar panel,&quot; said Mark Thurber, associate director of Stanford University&rsquo;s Program on Energy and Sustainable Development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The closer you read the National Report item, the more obvious the satire becomes. It turns out that the Wyoming Institute of Technology only exists as a <a href=\"http://witscience.org/\"><u>website</u></a>, with an obviously fake backstory. &quot;WIT,&quot; according to the website, was originally founded in 1943 as the Wyoming Institute of Education and Nuclear Energy Research (WIENER, get it?) and has purportedly invented such technologies as &quot;smellovision,&quot; the &quot;space toilet,&quot; the world&rsquo;s first computer virus, &quot;the world&rsquo;s first 100% organic artificial nose, which was created for pop-star Michael Jackson in 1999,&quot; and the &quot;E-condom.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As is often the case, what you see on social media isn&rsquo;t accurate. It&rsquo;s not true that &quot;solar panels drain the sun&rsquo;s energy.&quot; This claim originated with a satirical site, and it has no basis in science. Cue the solar flares: It gets a Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-05-29T12:02:29.704135", "ruling_date": "2014-05-29T15:46:05", "ruling_headline": "Claim that solar panels drain the sun\u2019s energy is satire, not science", "ruling_headline_slug": "claim-solar-panels-drain-suns-energy-are-satire-no", "ruling_link_text": "Don't put away that sunblock yet", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>National Report, &quot;<a href=\"http://nationalreport.net/solar-panels-drain-suns-energy-experts-say/\"><u>Solar Panels Drain the Sun&rsquo;s Energy, Experts Say</u></a>,&quot; May 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/satire/solarpanels.asp\"><u>Solar Drain</u></a>,&quot; May 25, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/23/chain-email/rumors-third-barack-obama-term-are-satire-passed-t/\"><u>Rumors of third Barack Obama term are satire passed off as truth</u></a>,&quot; May 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Mark Thurber, associate director of Stanford University&rsquo;s Program on Energy and Sustainable Development, May 29, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Fake_news", "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "", "false_count": 44, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "", "id": 27, "last_name": "Chain email", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "chain-email", "pants_count": 106, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-emailer.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/27/", "total_count": 180, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Solar panels drain the sun&rsquo;s energy.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "messages on the Internet", "statement_date": "2014-05-19", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 5, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/5/", "subject": "Environment", "subject_slug": "environment", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
