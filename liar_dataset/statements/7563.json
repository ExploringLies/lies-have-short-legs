No loopholes anywhere for anyone,&quot; <a href=\"http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/lapierre.htm\">he said</a>. &quot;That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system. This isn&#39;t new, or a change of position, or a concession. I&#39;ve been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also spoke in favor of preventing juvenile felons from ever owning guns, setting up instant background checks at gun shows and keeping schools gun-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other evidence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/01/nra-flip-flops-on-background-checks.html\">New York </a></em><a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/01/nra-flip-flops-on-background-checks.html\">magazine</a>, in a January 2013 story, dug up the advertising campaign LaPierre mentioned in his testimony. Titled &quot;Be reasonable,&quot; the NRA ads that ran in national newspapers said, &quot;We think it&#39;s reasonable to provide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and pawn shops. But what&#39;s unreasonable is how the proposed Lautenberg legislation ignores the 250,000 prohibited people, like felons, who&#39;ve walked away from gun stores &mdash; instead of being prosecuted for a federal felony for trying to buy a gun.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted the NRA for this story but did not receive a response about Bloomberg&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January, NRA board member Sandy Froman <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/01/31/nra-position-on-background-checks-has-changed-board-member-affirms/\">told CNN</a>, &quot;The NRA has changed its position, and the reason it&#39;s changed its position is because the system doesn&#39;t work.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaPierre himself acknowledged this change in a January 2013 Senate hearing in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., elementary school shooting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I do not believe the way the law is working now, unfortunately, that it does any good to extend the law to private sales between hobbyists and collectors. &hellip; The fact is, the law right now is a failure the way it&#39;s working,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then said, &quot;I understand, back in 1999, you said no loopholes anywhere for anyone. But now you do not support background checks for all buyers of firearms?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaPierre responded: &quot;I think the National Instant Check System, the way it&#39;s working now, is a failure. Because this administration is not prosecuting the people that they catch. Twenty-three states are not even putting the mental records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent into the system. Now, assume that if you don&#39;t prosecute, and they try to buy a gun, even if you catch them, and you let them walk away, to assume they&#39;re not going to get a gun -- they&#39;re criminals, they&#39;re homicidal maniacs, and they&#39;re mentally ill. I mean, we all know that homicidal maniacs, criminals and the insane ... don&#39;t abide by the law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NRA&rsquo;s website on March 12, 2013, <a href=\"http://nraila.org/news-issues/news-from-nra-ila/2013/3/statement-from-chris-w-cox-nra-ila-executive-director-regarding-inaccurate-nbc-story-alleging-that-nra-wont-oppose-background-check-bill.aspx\">posted its firm stance</a> against expanding background checks:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The NRA opposes criminalizing private firearms transfers between law-abiding individuals, and therefore opposes an expansion of the background check system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg said that in 1999, &quot;Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In congressional testimony following the Columbine High School shooting, LaPierre called it &quot;reasonable&quot; to conduct a background check &quot;for every sale at every gun show.
