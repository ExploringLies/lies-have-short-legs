Scott Walker&rsquo;s collective bargaining law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(On March 24, 2011, the state appeals court panel <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/118594454.html\">asked</a> the state Supreme Court to take the case. Prosser has indicated he will not recuse himself.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, let&rsquo;s evaluate Kloppenburg&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince the campaign has only begun to take on a high profile as the April 5 election approaches, let&rsquo;s first lay some foundation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.wicourts.gov/about/judges/supreme/prosser.htm\">Prosser</a>, 68, was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1998 and was re-elected three years later to a full 10-term term. He previously spent 18 years in the state Assembly representing the Appleton area; for eight of those years he was the Republican leader.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.kloppenburgforjustice.com/\">Kloppenburg</a>, 57, of Madison, has been an assistant state attorney general since 1989, working both as a prosecutor and a litigator. This is her first run for public office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKloppenburg has made <a href=\"http://www.wisdc.org/index.php?module=wisdc.websiteforms&amp;cmd=searchadvanced&amp;filter=+Search+&amp;contributor_name=Kloppenburg%2C+Joanne\">contributions</a> to Democratic candidates, but not Republicans, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign database. Groups that have endorsed her most recently include the <a href=\"http://www.wisconsin.sierraclub.org/political/documents/032211_PR_KloppenburgEndorsement.pdf\">Sierra Club</a>, the <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=230758\">Madison police </a><a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=230758\">union</a> and a <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=230174\">union</a> that represents public employees in Milwaukee County.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince 2008, Prosser has been part of a 4-3 conservative majority that controls the Supreme Court. A win by Kloppenburg, who is backed by many people upset with Walker&rsquo;s collective bargaining law, would create a 4-3 liberal majority.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Kloppenburg <a href=\"http://www.kloppenburgforjustice.com/\">campaign</a> spokeswoman Melissa Mulliken for evidence that Prosser has prejudged matters that are likely to be brought to the high court -- more specifically, which matters. Mulliken said there were none. Kloppenburg&rsquo;s allegation against Prosser, she said, was made as a broader statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccusing Prosser of prejudging matters, but providing no examples &hellip; well, that takes a lot of the steam out Kloppenburg&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHer campaign did cite four statements -- three by Prosser&rsquo;s campaign spokesman, Brian Nemoir, and one by Prosser himself -- as evidence to back up the accusation. We treat a statement from a spokesman as having been made by the candidate himself.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo let&rsquo;s examine what Kloppenburg cited.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&quot;Complement&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a Dec. 8, 2010, <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=220019\">news </a><a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=220019\">release</a> announcing Nemoir as Prosser&rsquo;s campaign spokesman, Nemoir said Prosser would be a &quot;common-sense complement to both the new administration and Legislature.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe reference was to Walker, who had been elected governor but not yet taken office, and Republicans who would control the Senate and Assembly in January.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProsser <a href=\"http://www.todaystmj4.com/news/local/118418894.html\">disavowed</a> the statement weeks later, saying he had not seen it before it went out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the statement left a clear impression that, rather than being part of an independent judiciary, Prosser saw himself as in league with Republicans who controlled the executive and legislative branches of government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&quot;Closely mirrors&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter Kloppenburg <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/111603909.html\">blasted</a> the &quot;complement&quot; comment, Nemoir <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/111603909.html\">responded </a>with an e-mail the next day describing Prosser as an independent, &quot;rule-of-law judge.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the same statement, however, Nemoir said Prosser&rsquo;s &quot;personal ideology more closely mirrors that of the incoming administration and Legislature.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Kloppenburg campaign cited that as evidence of prejudging.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Kloppenburg ignored the rest of Nemoir&rsquo;s quote, which was that Prosser&rsquo;s &quot;impartial approach to applying the law won&#39;t deviate&quot; -- in other words, that he would not prejudge cases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&quot;Conservative majority&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNemoir said Feb. 9, 2011, that the Prosser-Kloppenburg race &quot;is about a 4-3 common-sense conservative majority vs. a 3-4 liberal majority, and nothing more.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis statement essentially reiterates that Prosser is a conservative who could hold a swing vote on the Supreme Court. It doesn&rsquo;t support Kloppenburg&rsquo;s claim that Prosser has shown he would prejudge cases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&quot;Political conservative&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKloppenburg&rsquo;s campaign cited instances in which Prosser also described himself as a political conservative, and claimed that indicates prejudging.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt a March 22, 2011, debate, Prosser acknowledged being a political conservative. But he <a href=\"http://www.wpr.org/news/newsheadlines.cfm\">said</a> that since becoming a justice, he has &quot;tried very hard to withdraw from the political process, move to the center of the political spectrum, and view each case impartially on the facts of the law.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs with the earlier comments, Prosser calling himself a political conservative is not evidence that he would ignore facts and the law in how he votes on the Supreme Court.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTime for a verdict.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statements cited by Kloppenburg indicate Prosser is politically conservative, has views similar to Walker and GOP leaders in the Legislature, and that his re-election would maintain a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. The fact that Prosser disavowed one statement, about his being a &quot;complement&quot; to Walker and other GOP leaders, indicates he had concern about signaling how he might rule on cases.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tBut Kloppenburg didn&rsquo;t accuse Prosser of giving signals. She said he had &quot;prejudged matters that are likely to come before the court.&quot; Yet she could provide no examples.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Kloppenburg&rsquo;s claim Barely True.</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
