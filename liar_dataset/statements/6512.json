She did not think &#39;Obamacare&#39; went far enough. She was far beyond &#39;Obamacare.&#39; She wants a Medicare system for all, in which the government makes all the decisions for your health care system.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/09/tommy-thompson/republican-tommy-thompson-says-democratic-rep-tamm/\">Mostly </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/09/tommy-thompson/republican-tommy-thompson-says-democratic-rep-tamm/\">True</a> a Thompson claim that Baldwin is the most liberal member of the House. But with <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/healthcare/health_care_law\">polls</a> indicating most Americans want to repeal Obama&rsquo;s federal health reform law, does Baldwin really want to go further? To a &quot;completely government-controlled&quot; health care system that provides Medicare not only for people over 65 but for everyone?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Health reform terms</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs we begin, it&rsquo;s important to look at key terms connected to health care reform and Obama&rsquo;s reform law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/7909.pdf\">definitions</a> are from the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent organization that analyzes the health care system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Universal care: </strong>A system that provides health coverage to all people through measures such as an individual mandate or a single-payer system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Individual mandate:</strong> A requirement that all individuals obtain health insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Single-payer: </strong>A health care system in which the government pays for health care services, but is not involved in the delivery of health care.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Public option:</strong> An insurance plan administered and funded by the government that would be offered along with private insurance plans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Obama&rsquo;s health reform law</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe health reform that Obama signed into law in 2010 law significantly increases government regulation of health insurers and includes an individual mandate for nearly all Americans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(During the primary campaign we rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/15/tommy-thompson/gop-wisconsin-senate-candidate-thompson-says-he-ne/\">False</a> a claim by Thompson, who supports repealing Obama&rsquo;s reform law, that he never supported a mandate.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the reform law, as PolitiFact National has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2010/dec/16/lie-year-government-takeover-health-care/\">reported</a>, employers will continue providing health insurance to most Americans and, overall, more people will get private health coverage. And it goes without saying that the reform law doesn&rsquo;t take the European approach, where the government owns the hospitals and the doctors are public employees; nor the Canadian universal-single payer approach, in which no private insurance is allowed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Baldwin&rsquo;s position</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s look at Baldwin, who was elected to the House in 1998, and see how she stands on these key points:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Universal care: </strong>Baldwin has long advocated providing health insurance for everyone.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1999, Baldwin spoke at a Washington, D.C. rally for the &quot;Universal Health Care 2000 (U2K)&quot; movement. In a <a href=\"http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/news/press-releases/1999/10/baldwin-calls-for-health-care-for-all.shtml\">news </a><a href=\"http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/news/press-releases/1999/10/baldwin-calls-for-health-care-for-all.shtml\">release</a> about the event, she said she was one of the few politicians who ran for office in 1998 &quot;who dared to make &lsquo;health care for all&rsquo; the focus of her campaign for Congress.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin also <a href=\"http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/news/press-releases/1999/11/obey-baldwin-thompson-join-forces-on-health-care-initiative.shtml\">announced</a> that Wisconsin could be one of 10 states to receive grants to develop suggestions for a &quot;federal-state partnership to provide health coverage for all of their citizens.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Interestingly, the announcement was made with Thompson at the governor&rsquo;s office in Madison, the release said.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2000, Baldwin <a href=\"http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/news/press-releases/2000/08/baldwin-obey-bill-calls-for-health-care-coverage-for-all.shtml\">introduced</a> the Health Security for All Americans <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/hr4992/text\">Act</a>, which would have <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/hr4992\">required</a> states to provide universal coverage. The bill <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/hr4992\">died</a> without a House vote, as it did Baldwin after reintroduced it in <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/107/hr5269\">2002</a>, <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/108/hr4325\">2004</a> and <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr2133\">2005</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Single-payer:</strong> Baldwin tried to get the government more involved in health care by making it the sole payer of health care services.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2009, on the day the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted for Obama&rsquo;s reform law, Baldwin <a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/288147-2\">said</a>: &quot;I am one of the members of this committee who believes strongly that a single-payer health system is the best way to comprehensively and fairly reform our health care system.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat version of Obama&rsquo;s measure didn&rsquo;t include the single-payer element, but Baldwin <a href=\"http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/news/press-releases/2009/07/baldwin-leads-efforts-to-unify-democrats-and-advance-health-care-reform.shtml\">said</a> she had &quot;played a role in securing a commitment that a single-payer health care alternative will receive consideration by the full House of Representatives.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, in pushing single-payer, Baldwin would go beyond Obama&rsquo;s law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Public option:</strong> Baldwin advocates for the federal government offering health insurance along with private insurers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyrv99MucfM\">said</a> she hoped a public option in Obama&rsquo;s law would lead to single-payer. The version of Obama&rsquo;s measure that Baldwin <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/house-passes-health-reform-without-reproductive-rights\">voted </a><a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/house-passes-health-reform-without-reproductive-rights\">for</a> in 2009 included the public option, but the final version did not.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin continues to advocate for going further than the Obama reform law does. On her official House website, Baldwin <a href=\"http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/about/biography.shtml\">says</a> her &quot;driving motivation in politics is to pass legislation that will guarantee health care for all in America.&quot; She also <a href=\"http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/issues/health-care.shtml\">says</a> that the reform law &quot;is not perfect, and I will continue to work to improve it as it is phased in over the next four years. In particular, I strongly believe that allowing Americans the choice of a public option is essential.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, to the third part of Thompson&rsquo;s claim, that Baldwin supports &quot;Medicare for all.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir pointed out that Baldwin was one of several dozen co-sponsors of the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:HR00676:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp;\">Act</a>, which has been introduced several times during her tenure. It would have provided universal care by creating a national health insurance program and prohibiting private insurers from selling coverage that duplicates benefits in the program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.marquette.edu/polisci/faculty_giaimo.shtml\">Susan Giaimo</a>, a visiting political science professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, whose specialties include health care politics and policy, told us the government would have had a lot of clout in negotiating prices with health care providers under the bill. It&rsquo;s not clear whether &quot;Medicare for all&quot; would get rid of private health insurance, but private health care providers would remain, she said. And it doesn&rsquo;t go as far as the British model of &quot;socialized medicine,&quot; with the government owning hospitals and employing the health care workers, she said. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA final note:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson and other Republicans like to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EMJwjZG1oM&amp;feature=youtu.be\">cite</a> a clip from a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Wb6InILa8&amp;feature=player_embedded\">speech</a> Baldwin made at a September 2010 political rally in which she said, chuckling: &quot;I actually was for a government takeover of medicine. I was for a single-payer plan.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin actually was criticizing those who called Obama&rsquo;s reform law a &quot;government takeover&quot; (which PolitiFact chose as its <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2010/dec/16/lie-year-government-takeover-health-care/\">lie of the </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2010/dec/16/lie-year-government-takeover-health-care/\">year</a> for 2010). But she did go on to say she wanted to go further than the reform law does: &quot;I was for a single-payer plan and that isn&rsquo;t, as we know, what we ended up with, but I also think what we ended up with was incredible progress for the American people.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson said Baldwin wants a &quot;completely government-controlled&quot; health care system that goes &quot;far beyond &#39;Obamacare&#39;&quot; and is &quot;a Medicare system for all.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin hasn&rsquo;t hasn&rsquo;t advocated for socialized medicine. But she has pushed &quot;Medicare for all&quot; legislation and she supports single payer and the public option, government elements that go beyond Obama&rsquo;s reform law. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn balance, we rate Thompson&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-21T17:30:41.876858", "ruling_date": "2012-08-26T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tommy Thompson says U.S. Senate rival Tammy Baldwin wants to go \"far beyond 'Obamacare'\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "tommy-thompson-says-us-senate-rival-tammy-baldwin-", "ruling_link_text": "Her past votes went farther", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWIBA-AM, Vicki McKenna <a href=\"http://www.wiba.com/player/?station=WIBA-AM&amp;program_name=podcast&amp;program_id=vickimckenna.xml&amp;mid=22354423\">interview</a> (at 5:15) of Tommy Thompson, Aug. 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tC-SPAN, <a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/288147-2\">Tammy Baldwin</a> at House Energy and Commerce Committee (at 3:26), July 31, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Rep.
