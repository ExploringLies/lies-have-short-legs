Scott Walker released his <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2013/nov/17/factchecking-scott-walker-new-book/\"><u>political memoir</u></a>, Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate used a <a href=\"http://media.jrn.com/documents/Tate+email.doc\"><u>fund-raising email</u></a> to highlight what&rsquo;s not in the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He claimed Walker is doing a number of things badly, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Failing at job creation and dropping Wisconsin to 45th in the nation in job growth prospects while campaigning for president out of state.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nov. 17, 2013, solicitation cites a low ranking and pins the blame squarely on Walker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Tate right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tate&#39;s evidence </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff to flesh out the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said Walker has been campaigning out of state for president since at least March 2013, when Walker <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/walker-opens-up-about-white-house-ambitions-88938.html#ixzz2lKIsJbOV%20\"><u>told Politico</u></a> at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he gave a speech, that he would be visiting Iowa in May 2013. Walker at the time (and since) acknowledged he was open to a presidential bid and he declined to pledge to serve a full four-year term if re-elected governor in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Walker hasn&rsquo;t declared himself a candidate for president, nor formed an exploratory committee, he has made many political trips across the country during 2013 and is increasingly mentioned as a potential GOP nominee, particularly since the release of his book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Wisconsin dropping to 45th in job growth prospects, Baldauff cited Forbes&rsquo; annual <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/best-states-for-business/\"><u>&quot;best states for business&quot;</u></a> feature, published in September 2013. Wisconsin&#39;s projected annual job growth was put at 1.3% over the next five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Badger State adopted the slogan of &#39;Open for Business&#39; in 2011, erecting signs along the state border,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/places/wi/\"><u>Forbes said</u></a>. &quot;Results have been slow, but Wisconsin&rsquo;s projected job growth has improved slightly, moving from No. 49 to No. 45 among the states.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, one study ranks Wisconsin 45th for future job prospects, as Tate stated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But contrary to what he claimed, the state&rsquo;s ranking actually rose, albeit not by much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other rankings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A May 2013 <a href=\"http://alec.org/docs/RSPS-6th-Edition?utm_source=Main+alec+site&amp;utm_medium=RSPS+Download+page&amp;utm_campaign=RSPS+Download+calculator\"><u>report</u></a> from the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council ranked <a href=\"http://www.alec.org/wp-content/uploads/WI.pdf\"><u>Wisconsin 15th</u></a> in &quot;economic outlook,&quot; up from 32nd a year earlier, based on 15 policy variables such as taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that report didn&rsquo;t rank the states on future job growth and we didn&rsquo;t find any others that did. &nbsp;Several experts we checked with -- at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Wisconsin Budget Project and the Center on Wisconsin Strategy -- weren&rsquo;t aware of any, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the rest of Tate&rsquo;s claim, he directly blames Walker, even suggesting his political travels were a contributing factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it goes without saying that the state&rsquo;s projected job growth depends on more than the actions of one person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we&rsquo;ve noted in previous fact-checks, a chief executive such as a governor has influence over jobs, but so do a host of other factors, such as national trends, that are beyond a governor&rsquo;s control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tate said Walker has dropped Wisconsin &quot;to 45th in the nation in job growth prospects while campaigning for president out of state.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forbes rates Wisconsin 45th, although that&rsquo;s a slight improvement, not a drop. And Walker bears some, but not all of the blame, for the ranking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we give Tate a Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To comment on this item, go to the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-testing-democratic-party-chairs-claim-on-scott-walker-job-growth-ranking-b99151056z1-233534981.html?ipad=y\">Journal Sentinel website</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-26T12:05:27.660744", "ruling_date": "2013-12-01T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker responsible for Wisconsin's low and dropping projected job growth, Democratic Party chief Mike Tate says", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-responsible-wisconsins-low-and-droppi", "ruling_link_text": "45th but rising; Walker only partly to blame", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wisconsin Democratic Party, Mike Tate <a href=\"http://media.jrn.com/documents/Tate+email.doc\"><u>fund-raising email</u></a>, Nov. 17, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Wisconsin Democratic Party communications director Melissa Baldauff, Nov. 19, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forbes, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/places/wi/\"><u>&quot;Best States for Business,&quot;</u></a> September 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/walker-opens-up-about-white-house-ambitions-88938.html#ixzz2lKIsJbOV%20\"><u>&quot;Scott Walker opens up about White House ambitions,&quot;</u></a> March 16, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Chamber of Commerce, <a href=\"http://www.freeenterprise.com/americas-small-business-summit/how-does-your-state-rank-chamber-releases-enterprising-states-report\"><u>&quot;Enterprising States: Getting Down to Small Business,&quot;</u></a> April 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Journal, <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/on-numbers/scott-thomas/2013/06/governors-ranked-by-private-sector-job.html\"><u>&quot;How state governors rank on their job growth record,&quot;</u></a> June 27, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/09/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-wisconsin-had-84000-more-jobs-when/\"><u>&quot;Mary Burke says Wisconsin had 84,000 more jobs when she was commerce secretary,&quot;</u></a> Oct. 8, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Center on Wisconsin Strategy spokeswoman Michelle Bright, Nov. 22, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics press officer Gary Steinberg, Nov. 22, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Wisconsin Budget Project analyst Tamarine Cornelius, Nov. 25, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Mike", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "", "id": 1553, "last_name": "Tate", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "mike-tate", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Mike_Tate.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1553/", "total_count": 6, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says Gov.
