Republican Rob Cornilles is supportive; he said in last week&rsquo;s televised debate, <a href=\"http://www.kgw.com/video?id=137067858&amp;sec=547797\">about halfway through</a>the program, that the project has bipartisan support.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I do support the Keystone Pipeline. It&rsquo;s a bipartisan proposal. Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress want this to move forward, because it&rsquo;s not only a job creator, it&rsquo;s also a way for us to responsibly manage how that oil is transferred from Canada to Mexico.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDoes the pipeline have bipartisan support?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMuch of the really vocal support for this project comes from Republicans. Democrats, not so much, although there are some who want the project. Environmentalists are opposed while labor&rsquo;s AFL-CIO has decided not to take a formal position.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSenate Democrats who like the project are Max Baucus D-Mont., Jon Tester D-Mont., Mary Landrieu D-La., Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and Mark Begich, D-Alaska, Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Kent Conrad, D-N.D. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe queried our delegation. Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley are opposed. Rep. Earl Blumenauer was among 32 House Democrats who sent a letter urging the State Department<br />\r\nto reject the route. Schrader is opposed to the expedited process, but not necessarily against &mdash; or for &mdash; the project.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe don&rsquo;t think the support of one Democrat or one Republican makes a proposal bipartisan,<br />\r\nbut it&rsquo;s clear some Democrats are on board with the project. If we had to picture a bipartisan meter, the needle probably would surpass the halfway mark but fall short of 75 percent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe rule the statement Mostly True: Requiring clarification that Democrats who are opposed are really opposed.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-13T19:40:51.078230", "ruling_date": "2012-01-14T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "How bipartisan is support for the Keystone XL oil pipeline?
