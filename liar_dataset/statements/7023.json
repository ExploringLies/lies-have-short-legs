Just how much will this mean out of my pocket?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSupporters of a new Multnomah County Library District -- the Libraries Yes! Committee -- tried to put the tax measure in some context in a recent mailer. &quot;The typical homeowner will pay $4 more per month than the amount we currently pay.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe thought it was worth a quick check to see just what the measure&rsquo;s impact would be for the average homeowner.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe spoke with Liz Kaufman, who is handling media for the campaign, to see how it arrived at the $4 mark.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe directed us to the measure&rsquo;s explanatory statement written by Multnomah County Attorney Jenny Morf. In the statement, Morf wrote that &quot;If approved, the Multnomah County Library District will be formed with a permanent rate up to $1.24 per $1000 of assessed value. The typical homeowner will pay $49 a year above the cost of the current levy or $.89 per $1000 assessed value.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo that extra 35 cents per $1,000 of assessed value would mean an extra $49 a year. Divide that by 12 and you get $4.08. The math checks out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext we examined what constitutes a &quot;typical&quot; homeowner. According to Multnomah County, the median assessed home value for the county is $149,920. Homeowners at that level are paying just over $11 a month, or $133 a year, at the current 89-cent rate. That would get bumped up by about $4 to $15.50 -- or $185 annually -- if the tax district passes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe ran the numbers again, just to be safe, with the average assessed value, which is higher, about $178,000. At that number, homeowners currently pay $13.20 a month and can expect to pay $18.40 a month if the measure passes -- $5.20 more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy the way, homeowners won&rsquo;t see the full increase immediately. For the first five years, they would actually be charged $1.18 for each $1,000 of assessed value. After that, it starts to climb to the maximum $1.24.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile the ultimate cost would be more for the average house, we think it&rsquo;s fair to call the median number, where half the houses are assessed at more and half less, &quot;typical.&quot; Those figures back up the Libraries Yes! Committee&rsquo;s claim that the typical homeowner will pay $4 more per month&quot; once the new district goes into full effect.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-26T18:33:04.830628", "ruling_date": "2012-10-26T15:32:16", "ruling_headline": "Will a Multnomah County Library tax district cost the typical homeowner $4 a month?", "ruling_headline_slug": "will-multnomah-county-library-tax-district-cost-ty", "ruling_link_text": "The math bears them out", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://web.multco.us/sites/default/files/elections/documents/26-143_vp_nov_12.pdf\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.6180875101628877\">County Explanatory Statement</a>, County Attorney Jenny Morf, Oct. 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail from Libraries Yes!
