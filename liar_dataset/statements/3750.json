Scott Walker were about to escalate. Store owners were told &nbsp;activists were planning a May 1 campaign to slap stickers on several products to express anti-Walker sentiments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn April 27 Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/business/120789814.html\">story </a>about the association&rsquo;s warning was picked up by other media outlets, including <a href=\"http://www.fox6now.com/news/witi-20110427-grocery-sticker,0,1779804.story\">some </a>that took it another step -- saying unions were behind the sticker threat. A day later, Phil Neuenfeldt, president of the Wisconsin AFL-CIO responded with &nbsp;a statement that <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/business/120892664.html\">said </a>in part:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We have no knowledge beyond un-evidenced assertions made to the media by the Wisconsin Grocers Association of any such campaign, but let&#39;s be crystal clear -- there are not, nor have there ever been, any boycotts encouraged by our organizations.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second part of that statement caught our attention.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFollowing the collective bargaining law, haven&rsquo;t unions been turning up the heat on businesses -- including M&amp;I Bank and Kwik Trip -- where executives or political action committees supported Walker or GOP groups?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s stop and look at the dictionary definition of boycott:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;To abstain from or act together in abstaining from using, buying or dealing with as an expression of protest or disfavor or as a means of coercion,&quot; says <a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/boycott\">The Free </a><a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/boycott\">Dictionary. </a>Others such as Merriam-Webster.com and <a href=\"http://ethicalconsumer.org/\">ethicalconsumer.org </a>have similar definitions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Neuenfeldt about his statement, in light of the anti-Walker activities that have been in the news.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis answer: Those aren&rsquo;t official AFL-CIO boycotts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, there have been very few such boycotts. The reason, Neuenfeldt said, is simple: Such actions by the umbrella labor group are illegal under federal law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We don&rsquo;t boycott,&quot; he said. &quot;We can&rsquo;t.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat seems pretty cut and dried. But is it really?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, the state AFL-CIO is an umbrella group. But it includes about 1,000 affiliated local unions, which represent 250,000 members in the state. And Neuenfeldt&rsquo;s statement was &quot;there are not, nor have there ever been, any boycotts encouraged by our organizations.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat sure seems to include member unions, who under law are allowed to participate in boycotts. What&rsquo;s more, the statement didn&rsquo;t apply only to organizing boycotts, but &quot;encouraging&quot; them. So, let&rsquo;s turn to the record.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor instance, there is a &quot;Boycott Scott Walker Contributors&quot; <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/BoycottScottWalkerContributors\">page </a>on Facebook, which has more than 23,000 people and businesses -- including some unions representing firefighters, police officers and teachers -- listed as &quot;liking&quot; the page.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNeuenfeldt said those are individual actions and not coordinated by the umbrella labor group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, members of the Wisconsin State Employees Union, AFSCME Council 24, have been urging businesses to put signs in their windows supporting workers&rsquo; rights.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA letter sent to the businesses said in part: &quot;Failure to do so will leave us no choice but (to) do a public boycott of your business.&quot; State AFSCME leaders later dismissed that effort as the actions of a &quot;rogue&quot; union local.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about the actions of the state AFL-CIO itself?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt a May 5 news conference outside an M&amp;I Bank branch on Milwaukee&rsquo;s west side, the group said it withdrew $105,000 from the bank and closed its account as part of what it called the &quot;Move Your Money&quot; campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group withdrew its money to protest M&amp;I executives&rsquo; contributions to Walker and to underscore the threat to Wisconsin jobs that could come from the upcoming sale of M&amp;I to the Bank of Montreal. M&amp;I is listed among dozens of businesses on the &quot;Boycott Scott Walker Contributors&quot; page on Facebook.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSounds like the state AFL-CIO wants you to take your business elsewhere. Isn&rsquo;t that a boycott?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison history professor William Paul Jones, an expert on organized labor, disagrees. He said &quot;technically, a boycott is an organized action,&quot; while the withdrawal of money from M&amp;I by the state AFL-CIO is an individual action.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder federal law, he said, the existence of coercion is a key threshold for a protest or action to be considered a boycott.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the state AFL-CIO, for instance, can say: We&rsquo;re doing this, and we hope you follow suit. They run afoul of federal law if they set up picket lines and try to prevent customers from entering and so forth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerhaps the most famous <a href=\"http://www.ufw.org/_page.php?menu=research&amp;inc=history/05.html\">boycott </a>was that staged against grape growers from 1965-70, a nationwide effort that led to the creation of the United Farm Workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat boycott was not deemed illegal and resulted in the signing of a contract with the farm workers. Federal law expressly bans &quot;secondary&quot; boycotts -- such as actions against a parts supplier tied to a strike against an automaker.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed in the end, there was no mass stickering, which was what prompted the original warning from the grocers association and the Neuenfeldt response.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGrocers association CEO Brandon Scholz said he received word from one store up north where a customer was asked to leave because he was believed to have stickers with him.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScholz said media attention might have dissuaded protesters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut as we have noted, Neuenfeldt&rsquo;s statement was much broader than about the stickering threat. And making it more sweeping made it more problematic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNeuenfeldt said &quot;there are not, nor have there ever been, any boycotts encouraged by our organizations.&quot; He notes the statewide group is barred under federal law from engaging in boycotts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut his statement also applied to the organizations within the state AFL-CIO and not only to organizing boycotts, but also encouraging them. And unions clearly have been taking actions to support the anti-Walker boycott movement. Indeed, the state AFL-CIO called a news conference to highlight to the public it was taking a step that some of its member groups were withdrawing money from M&amp;I Bank.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s more, the average person does not view the issue from the legal perspective, but the practical result. They see union members protesting Walker and listing a gas station chain, bratwurst maker and many other businesses on a boycott Facebook page.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Neuenfeldt&rsquo;s statement Barely True.</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
