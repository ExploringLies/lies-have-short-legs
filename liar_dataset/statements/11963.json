Marco Rubio charged Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump with hypocrisy for hiring undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects instead of American citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He hired from Poland, and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment,&quot; Rubio said. &quot;That&rsquo;s a fact. People can look it up. I&rsquo;m sure people are Googling it right now, &lsquo;Trump Polish workers.&rsquo; You&rsquo;ll see $1 million for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Wrong, wrong,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did some Googling and also reached out to the Rubio campaign, which referred us to <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/08/trump-tower-was-built-on-undocumented-immigrants-backs.html\">media</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/13/nyregion/trump-says-he-didn-t-know-he-employed-illegal-aliens.html\">reports</a> about a protracted <a href=\"http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/774/802/1425921/\">class-action lawsuit</a> involving his hiring of Polish aliens 36 years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio is right about the Polish workers, but it&rsquo;s unclear how much Trump ended up paying. (The Trump campaign did not get back to us.) Here&rsquo;s the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometime between 1979 and 1980, Trump hired a contractor to demolish an old building in midtown Manhattan to make way for Trump Tower. The contractor signed on workers from a local union and, to meet Trump&rsquo;s tight deadline, also brought on 200 undocumented laborers from Poland dubbed the &quot;Polish Brigade.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Polish employees were off-the-books, working 12-hour shifts seven days a week for $4 to $5 an hour, with no overtime. Some workers were never paid what they were owed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1983, union members sued a union boss, Trump and his contractor for cheating the union out of pension and welfare funds by hiring the Polish Brigade. Trump owed the union pension fund $1 million, the plaintiffs said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Appearing in court in 1990, Trump blamed the violations on the contractor and denied knowing that the Polish workers were undocumented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nobody&rsquo;s proven to me that they were were illegal,&quot; Trump said, according to a Newsday report from the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, Manhattan Judge Charles Stewart ruled against Trump a year later, saying that his representative &quot;knew that the Polish workers were doing demolition work&quot; and that his company participated in a &quot;conspiracy&quot; to cheat the union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump owed the workers a little more than $325,000 plus interest and attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs, Stewart ruled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the end of it. Trump appealed and it would drag on for another decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1998, several members of the Polish Brigade told the <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/14/nyregion/after-15-years-in-court-workers-lawsuit-against-trump-faces-yet-another-delay.html?pagewanted=all\">New York Times</a></em> about their horrid working conditions. But Trump repeated that he didn&rsquo;t know about the legal status of the Polish Brigade and said he would not settle the case out of court &quot;on principle,&quot; according to the<em> New York Times.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the case was retried and Trump lost again, he would have had to pay about $4 million, the <em>Times </em>calculated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A year later, Trump quietly settled, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/deal-sealed-trump-tower-suit-article-1.834028\">according to the <em>New York Daily News</em></a>, but the agreement was placed under seal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It has been resolved on terms agreeable to both sides,&quot; labor lawyer Wendy Sloan, who represented the union members, told the<em> New York Daily News.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said Trump &quot;hired from Poland and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Trump&rsquo;s contractor, not Trump himself, who hired 200 undocumented Polish workers to demolish a building to make room for Trump Tower in Manhattan. Trump said he didn&rsquo;t know. The lawsuit sought $1 million in damages, and a judge ruled that Trump had to pay $325,000 plus interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the case was appealed and before it was retried, Trump settled the case out of court, so it&rsquo;s unclear how much he ended up doling out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio&rsquo;s statement is partially accurate but missing that context.
