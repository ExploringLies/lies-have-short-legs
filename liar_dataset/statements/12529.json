The manufacturer <a href=\"http://www.sigevolution.com/_includes/SIG-MCX-Brochure.pdf\">describes</a> the Sig MCX as &quot;the first true mission-adaptable weapon system.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson answered Sykes&rsquo; question by saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s that delicate balance, Charlie. And that&#39;s what we need to have an honest and legitimate conversation about, as opposed to leaping to conclusions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To say things like we&#39;ve got to ban assault rifles. Well, assault rifles already are banned. OK? So, we need to actually have an honest discussion about these issues and understand that this is very difficult, very complex.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing to understand up front is the difference between automatic and semiautomatic weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Automatic weapons -- banned</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Automatic</em> weapons -- sometimes known as fully automatic, or <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/12/08/why-bans-on-so-called-assault-weapons-are-unlikely-to-reduce-mass-shooting-deaths/\">machine guns</a> -- fire continuously when the trigger is held down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two federal laws have essentially banned them in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One law in 1935 all but banned automatic weapons like the Tommy gun. And another in 1986 prohibited fully automatic weapons, except for pre-existing weapons that were grandfathered in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Semiautomatic weapons -- not banned</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Semiautomatic</em> weapons, like the rifle Mateen carried, reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are not banned by federal law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1994 to 2004, there was a <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c103:H.R.3355.ENR:\">federal law</a>&nbsp;that banned the sale of certain types of new semiautomatic weapons, <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2012/07/gunmans-weapons-already-illegal/\">including</a> some types of AR-15 rifles. A limit on high-capacity magazines also was set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law, which was adopted to last for 10 years, was not renewed by Congress when it expired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The takeaway</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson takes the position that only automatic weapons qualify as assault weapons. It&rsquo;s worth noting that in at least one&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wtaq.com/podcasts/the-jerry-bader-show/1031/wisconsin-us-senator-ron-johnson-on-orlando-terrorists/\">other interview</a>&nbsp;the same day &mdash; with conservative Green Bay radio talk show host Jerry Bader &mdash; he spelled that out, saying &quot;an assault weapon is a fully automatic.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His office made the same argument to us, citing technical military definitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, that&rsquo;s not a generally accepted line of separation. The federal law that became defunct in 2004 was called the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and at the time the Department of Justice defined some semiautomatic guns as assault weapons. A number of state laws still have that wording on their books. And law enforcement agencies consider certain semiautomatic weapons, including the one used by Mateen, as assault weapons &mdash; or at minimum, assault-style weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the weapons used in the mass shootings in <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-bernardino-shooting-atf-says-all-4-guns-bought-legally/\">San Bernardino</a>, Calif., <a href=\"http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/07/21/colorado-theater-shooter-carried-4-guns-all-obtained-legally/\">Aurora, Colo.</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/newtown-police-chief-calls-assault-weapons-ban-article-1.1239657\">Newtown, Conn.</a> -- all of which were semiautomatic -- were all described by police as assault rifles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, in which the killer used a semiautomatic rifle was used, Johnson stated: &quot;Assault rifles already are banned.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some, including Johnson, contend that only weapons that are automatic &mdash; firing continuously when the trigger is held down are assault weapons &mdash; are assault weapons. Those are essentially prohibited by federal laws. But that definition is narrow, and Johnson&rsquo;s claim gives a misleading impression of a comprehensive ban.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lawmakers, law enforcement officials and others widely refer to many semiautomatic weapons like the rifle used in Orlando and other mass shootings &mdash; which reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed &mdash; as assault weapons. Those are not banned by federal law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-15T13:49:22.693474", "ruling_date": "2016-06-20T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Question after Orlando: Are assault rifles banned?
