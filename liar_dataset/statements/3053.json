In January 2011, Wisconsin <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/113213474.html\">moved to </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/113213474.html\">join</a> 20 other states in a federal court lawsuit in Florida that seeks to overturn the law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo assess Fitzgerald&rsquo;s claim, we asked his spokesman, former Milwaukee radio personality John Jagler, for the source of the 15,000 jobs figure. Jagler said it came from the <a href=\"http://www.thomasmore.org/qry/page.taf?id=23\">Thomas More Law </a><a href=\"http://www.thomasmore.org/qry/page.taf?id=23\">Center</a> in Michigan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe public-interest law firm, which says it represents Christians and their religious beliefs, filed a suit in federal court in Michigan that is similar to the Florida case that Wisconsin wants to join.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter a Michigan judge <a href=\"http://www.thomasmore.org/downloads/sb_thomasmore/Healthcare10-07-10ORDERDENYINGPLAINTIFFSMOTIO.pdf\">upheld</a> the health care reforms law -- in a ruling the law center is <a href=\"http://www.thomasmore.org/downloads/sb_thomasmore/Obamacare-AppellantsBrief--Filed.pdf\">appealing</a> -- law center president Richard Thompson issued a <a href=\"http://www.thomasmore.org/qry/page.taf?id=19&amp;_function=print&amp;sbtblct_uid1=848&amp;month=10&amp;year=2010\">statement</a>. It said the health reforms will &quot;add an estimated 16,000 to 20,000 additional IRS agents to monitor tax returns and records to determine compliance with the new regulations.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Fitzgerald was slightly more conservative with his 15,000 claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked with the IRS, which said it has not settled on a number or even done its own jobs estimate. So any number out there presented as fact is problematic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBack to the Thomas More Law Center number.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson arrived at his 16,000 to 20,000 estimate after reviewing articles by conservative think tanks and news outlets, according to law center spokeswoman Kate Lynch. Those articles cited a March 2010 <a href=\"http://republicans.waysandmeans.house.gov/UploadedFiles/IRS_Power_Report.pdf\">Republican </a><a href=\"http://republicans.waysandmeans.house.gov/UploadedFiles/IRS_Power_Report.pdf\">report</a> from the House Ways and Means Committee, she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat report didn&rsquo;t use numbers as high as Thompson&rsquo;s. It said the IRS &quot;may need to hire as many as 16,500 additional auditors, agents and other employees to investigate and collect billions in new taxes from Americans&quot; in connection with the health care reform law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Republican report&rsquo;s estimate was based in part on a November 2009 <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/107xx/doc10731/Reid_letter_11_18_09.pdf\">financial</a><a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/107xx/doc10731/Reid_letter_11_18_09.pdf\"> impact </a><a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/107xx/doc10731/Reid_letter_11_18_09.pdf\">estimate</a> by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The budget office projected that administering the law will cost the IRS between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe nine-page Republican report cited the 16,500 jobs figure five times. However, as our colleagues at PolitiFact National <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/29/mark-kirk/kirk-says-health-care-bill-will-lead-irs-hire-more/\">pointed out</a>, the report also hedged its estimate, saying in a footnote that the number of additional IRS jobs likely will be between 11,800 and 16,500.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s circle back.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFitzgerald claimed that 15,000 IRS employees &quot;have to be added&quot; to manage the health care reform law, as if it&rsquo;s a settled point. There&rsquo;s little question more IRS workers will have to be added, but the agency has not set a number. And there is no evidence that 15,000 will be the final number, though it is within the range of one government estimate, albeit one done for House Republicans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Fitzgerald&rsquo;s statement Barely True.</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
