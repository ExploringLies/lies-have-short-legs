Let&rsquo;s start with the origins of the National Day of Prayer, which is an annual observance for people of all faiths.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPresident Harry Truman established the day as a national event in 1952. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed a resolution designating the first Thursday in May as the National Day of Prayer. Every president since &ndash; including Obama &ndash; has issued a proclamation to recognize the day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama, however, has not held the National Day of Prayer ceremony at the White House that President George W. Bush had for eight years. Presidents George H.W. Bush held one, in 1989, and Reagan also held one, in 1982. President Bill Clinton had none. So, there have not been 21 annual National Day of Prayer ceremonies, as the email claims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact-checking this email, we found at least 30 published reports in a basic Google search debunking various claims in it. While those reports confirm that Obama decided against the public White House ceremony, none state exactly why. In a May 7, 2009 CNN &nbsp;video, a representative with the Christian Broadcast Network speculated the cancelation might stem from publicity about controversial comments once made by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama&rsquo;s longtime pastor in Chicago. Other articles imply that a statement in Obama&rsquo;s inaugural speech about inclusivity of all religions and nonreligions in the United States might have been a factor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the time, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said of Obama&rsquo;s plans on the National Day of Prayer,&nbsp;&quot;Privately, he&rsquo;ll pray as he does every day.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe same is expected this year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;As he has done each of the last three years, President Obama will continue to recognize the National Day of Prayer,&quot; White House spokesman Brandon Lepow said in an email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext, let&rsquo;s review the claim about &quot;a National Day of Prayer FOR THE MUSLIM RELIGION&quot; being held &quot;on Capitol Hill, Beside the White House.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Jummah Prayer on Capitol Hill event was a one-time only activity coordinated by the Dar-ul-Islam mosque in Elizabeth to &quot;clear up myths about Muslims,&quot; said Imam Ali Jaaber, who attended the Sept. 25, 2009 event. It was never billed as a National Day Of Prayer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHassen Abdellah, board president at Dar-ul-Islam, organized the event in response to positive remarks by Obama in his inaugural speech and during another speech five months later in Egypt about welcoming and acknowledging the presence of Muslims in the United States, Jaaber said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, Capitol Hill is approximately one mile from the White House &ndash; not beside it. And, Muslim is not a religion. A person who follows the religion Islam is a Muslim.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA chain email circulating in New Jersey that Obama canceled the 21st annual National Day of Prayer ceremony in 2009 but a National Day of Prayer for Muslims was held later that year on Capitol Hill is full of inaccuracies. While it&rsquo;s true that Obama did not hold a public ceremony at the White House that President George W. Bush did, it&rsquo;s untrue that the ceremony would have been the 21st annual event. But wait &ndash; there&rsquo;s more: the email&rsquo;s author incorrectly located Capitol Hill as &quot;beside&quot; the White House and identified Muslim as a religion. Despite the numerous errors in the email, it does contain an element of truth -- and that fits the Truth-O-Meter&rsquo;s definition for Mostly False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this story, go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/politifact_nj_obama_claim_abou.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-02-01T16:32:51.308017", "ruling_date": "2012-02-09T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Email claim that Obama canceled National Day of Prayer ceremony contains numerous errors", "ruling_headline_slug": "claim-obama-canceled-national-day-prayer-has-been-", "ruling_link_text": "Little prayer of accuracy", "ruling_state": "New Jersey", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tChain email &nbsp;that President Barack Obama canceled the National Day of Prayer, received Jan. 30, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSnopes.com, &quot;President Obama canceled the National Day of Prayer,&quot;
