The latest attack has been that the Dunedin native lobbied on radical changes to<strong> </strong>Medicare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A campaign commercial released on Jan. 25, 2014, features a voiceover detailing Jolly&rsquo;s financial windfall from his work in Washington. It goes on to say, &quot;Jolly even lobbied for a group committed to privatizing Social Security and then lobbied on a plan to turn Medicare into a costly voucher program.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Jolly lobby on Medicare vouchers? This is a significant charge, since the district<a href=\"http://proximityone.com/cd113_demographics.htm\"> <u>ranks eighth in the nation</u></a> for population over 65 -- those eligible for Medicare. It&rsquo;s also turning into a favored Democratic attack against Jolly, implying that he favored a plan to alter the program. We decided to investigate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Ryan budget</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jolly was a longtime aide and general counsel to the late Rep. C.W. Bill Young, whose death triggered the March 11 special election. Later, Jolly worked as a lobbyist from 2007 to 2012, first for Van Scoyoc Associates Inc., then for his own firm, Three Bridges Advisors. One of his clients at both firms was Free Enterprise Nation, a pro-business, anti-regulation advocacy group founded by Jim MacDougald, who is now Jolly&rsquo;s campaign finance co-chairman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Nov. 2009 <a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=948da3d6-7b05-4ce2-a384-a2d05e77ab65&amp;filingTypeID=1\"><u>lobbying disclosure form</u></a> (with spelling errors) shows Jolly worked on behalf of Free Enterprise Nation for &quot;Health Care reform, Social Security Reform, Paycheck Fairness Act and other labor related issues and initatives; Taxpayer proection, and Small business.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His campaign confirmed the disclosure referred to a meeting with Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the former vice presidential running mate for Mitt Romney.<strong> </strong>Ryan has written several <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/aug/28/barack-obama/radio-ad-barack-obama-says-paul-ryan-tried-change-/\"><u>budget proposals</u></a> that support restructuring Social Security and Medicare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan&rsquo;s plan was first submitted to the House as &quot;The Roadmap for America&rsquo;s Future&quot; in 2008 and again in 2010. &nbsp;The proposal called for Medicare to be replaced with a government payment to beneficiaries to buy private insurance instead. These payouts were called subsidies or &quot;premium support&quot; by supporters and &quot;vouchers&quot; by detractors. The plan was reintroduced in 2011, 2012 and 2013, when they were passed by the Republican-led House but not the Democratic-controlled Senate. So the budget proposals have never been enacted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact has considered whether the Ryan version of Medicare was a voucher system, and found the claim was<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/16/barack-obama/does-paul-ryan-want-turn-medicare-voucher-program/\"> <u>Mostly True</u></a>, though a more expansive version of the Democratic claim -- that proposals like Ryan&rsquo;s would &quot;end Medicare&quot; -- received<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/dec/20/lie-year-democrats-claims-republicans-voted-end-me/\"> <u>PolitiFact&rsquo;s 2011 Lie of the Year</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jolly campaign at first said Jolly didn&rsquo;t actively lobby either way to get Ryan&rsquo;s budget proposals passed. Then they said he opposed the part of the plan that would change Medicare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jolly was there to &quot;advocate for transparency of the out-year obligations of Social Security and Medicare&quot; and &nbsp;&quot;transparency and protecting promises made to beneficiaries,&quot; said Jolly campaign spokesman Sarah Bascom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a Dec. 8, 2013, edition of Bay News 9&rsquo;s<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/political-connections-sun-david-jolly-shrinks-from-ryan-plan/2155732\"> <u>Political Connections</u></a>, Jolly<strong> </strong>himself said &quot;there was a lot of good in the Ryan budget.&quot; But Jolly also said he believed the budget wasn&rsquo;t the proper approach to some problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think we have to be careful on the Ryan budget for a couple of reasons,&quot; he said on the show. &quot;Entitlement programs &mdash; Social Security, Medicare &mdash; we know what that means to the community here. I have said from the very beginning, we have to protect the promises that have been made, to everybody.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vouching for Jolly</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of Jolly&rsquo;s<strong> </strong>disclosure forms for his work with Free Enterprise Nation list&nbsp;Medicare as a topic. Nonetheless, the Sink campaign inferred that if Jolly was discussing &quot;Health Care reform&quot; with Ryan,<strong> </strong>and Ryan&rsquo;s budget proposal was a topic, then Jolly had lobbied on the voucher plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts we spoke to said the term &quot;Health Care reform&quot; was broad enough to include Medicare, since disclosure forms only require topics and not specifics. The caveat is that Sink&rsquo;s attack would imply, to most reasonable people, that Jolly was in favor of the voucher plan, not against it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts on lobbying said that if Jolly was at a meeting where the Ryan budget was discussed, that counts as lobbying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brett Kappel, an attorney for Washington, D.C., law firm Arent Fox who specializes in lobbying, said that according to the<a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/Lobbying/Lobby_Disclosure_Act/TOC.htm\"> <u>Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995</u></a>, being paid for any discussion of a piece of legislation with a covered government official is an act of lobbying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you&rsquo;re for or against it,&quot; Kappel said, adding that even though Ryan&rsquo;s budget proposal was a not technically a piece of legislation -- budget resolutions do not get sent to the president to be signed, as normal bills do -- &nbsp;it qualified as an item covered under disclosure guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are a lot of gray areas in the rules,&quot; he said. &quot;This isn&rsquo;t one of them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also doesn&rsquo;t matter if Jolly&rsquo;s sentiments about the budget were his or those of his client, Free Enterprise Nation. &quot;He&rsquo;s representing his client,&quot; Kappel said. &quot;If he didn&rsquo;t know his client&rsquo;s position, he shouldn&rsquo;t have said anything.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Jolly himself said in a<a href=\"http://www.wfla.com/story/24624764/watch-keiths-uncut-interview-with-david-jolly\"><u> Feb. 3, 2014 interview</u></a> with Tampa Bay TV station WFLA, that he had lobbied on the budget proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A federal lobbying registration filing for a client simply says that this bill was discussed, so yes, I met with Paul Ryan, at the time that he was writing the Ryan budget,&quot; Jolly said, again specifying the conversation was about projecting future costs of Social Security and Medicare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So what I talked to Paul Ryan about was transparency of the out-year debt, and as he&rsquo;s wrestling with reforms, making sure that&rsquo;s included. Now, all that appears on the filing is that I Iobbied on the Ryan budget, so they have taken that and they can play with it however they want.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://proximityone.com/cd113_demographics.htm\"><u>One of Sink&rsquo;s campaign commercials claims that</u></a> Jolly &quot;lobbied on a plan&quot; by Ryan that would turn Medicare into a voucher program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She&rsquo;s suggesting that a meeting with would-be Medicare reformist Ryan on behalf of Free Enterprise Nation had to be advocating for the congressman&rsquo;s plan to alter the face of the retiree health insurance program. Jolly&rsquo;s campaign acknowledged that Jolly had attended a meeting on an overall budget proposal that included changes to Medicare, and under the law, that is enough to count as lobbying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Jolly&rsquo;s camp says he didn&rsquo;t support Ryan&rsquo;s potential changes to Medicare, and we can&rsquo;t contradict that. More importantly, neither can Sink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democrats used vague language that a reasonable person would assume meant Jolly was promoting the voucher portion of the proposal, when Jolly says he was critical of it. There&rsquo;s a lack of evidence to tie Jolly specifically to that part of the Ryan budget plan, even though he did lobby on the legislation and was discussing Medicare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sink is leaving out important context as she tries to harness a hot-button issue. We rate her claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-02-03T15:49:35.815426", "ruling_date": "2014-02-06T15:38:42", "ruling_headline": "David Jolly 'lobbied on a plan' to turn Medicare into a voucher program, Alex Sink says", "ruling_headline_slug": "david-jolly-lobbied-plan-turn-medicare-costly-vouc", "ruling_link_text": "Technically, but there's a lot of gray here", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube video, &quot;<a href=\"http://youtu.be/3DuytuyzGsk\"><u>Solutions</u></a>,&quot;
