Mark Warner joined the ranks of Wall Street critics during a recent radio interview, by complaining that investors increasingly are focused on reaping quick profits from companies at the expense of long-term value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The average time someone used to hold a share of stock back in the &rsquo;60s was eight years. Now, the average time is four months,&quot; he said during an <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Mark-Warner-2016-elections-president/2016/06/19/id/734612/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview</u></a> on &quot;Cat&rsquo;s Roundtable,&quot; a New York City radio talk show hosted by John Catsimatidis, a billionaire businessman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether Warner, D-Va., is right about the plunge in share-holding time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warner&rsquo;s office sent us a variety of articles by academics, investment strategists, newspapers and magazines that contained similar statistics to the ones cited by the senator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The source of the <a href=\"http://www.nyxdata.com/nysedata/asp/factbook/viewer_edition.asp?mode=table&amp;key=2206&amp;category=4\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>historic data</u></a> is the New York Stock Exchange which, for most of the 20th century, was the dominant U.S. stock-trading venue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the NYSE&rsquo;s average holding period for stocks at the start of each new decade, beginning at Warner&rsquo;s mark in 1960:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;1960, eight years, four months;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;1970, five years, three months;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;1980, two years, nine months;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;1990, two years, two months; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;2000, one year, two months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But many new trading venues have opened and expanded in recent decades - E*Trade and NASDAQ, for example - and the New York Stock Exchange&rsquo;s dominance has diminished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 25 percent of all U.S. trading now occurs on the NYSE, which has high financial requirements for the companies it lists and generally deals with large, stable stocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2004, the NYSE changed its formula for calculating average share-holding periods to focus on its own listings. Credit Suisse that year began computing share-holding data that reflect the broader U.S. stock market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Credit Suisse figures show that in 2008 and 2009, when the nation was mired in the Great Recession, shares turned over an average almost five times a year. That&rsquo;s slowed to about three times a year since 2013 or, as Warner put it, once every four months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The World Bank offers more conservative figures, saying U.S. shares, on average, turned over four times a year during the Great Recession and that slowed to 1.65 times a year in 2015 - or about once every eight months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stock market analysts and academics note a variety of reasons for the quickening turnover of shares. Many say the days of small ma-and-pa investors have given way to an era of mutual funds and hedge funds that exert strong pressure of companies to produce short-term profits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The growth of e-trading also is cited; so are federal laws passed in 1993 that tied the bonuses of executives to their achievement of measurable performance goals in order for the bonuses to be tax-deductible for their companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warner said the consequence of &quot;activist investors&quot; is that corporations pay less attention to training workers and to research and development. He said Congress should explore offering tax incentives to companies that embrace those long-range goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many activist investors, to the contrary, say their actions have been beneficial and note that the stock market has continued to rise over the decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warner said, &quot;The average time someone used to hold a share of stock back in the &rsquo;60s was eight years. Now, the average time is four months.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gist of Warner&rsquo;s statement is undeniable: The average holding period for stocks has eroded greatly during the past 56 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The specifics of Warner&rsquo;s statement, however, need a little elaboration. Estimates by Credit Suisse jibe with Warner&rsquo;s claim that shares, on average, now are held for four months. The World Bank estimates the holding period now is about eight months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we rate Warner&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2825f4d2-7663-4da5-8b09-70db1503d5e3\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2825f4d2-7663-4da5-8b09-70db1503d5e3</a> \r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-05T09:22:24.214968", "ruling_date": "2016-07-06T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Mark Warner says average holding time for stocks has fallen to four months", "ruling_headline_slug": "mark-warner-says-average-holding-time-stocks-has-f", "ruling_link_text": "Demand for fast profits", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Mark Warner, <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Mark-Warner-2016-elections-president/2016/06/19/id/734612/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Radio interview on &quot;The Cat&rsquo;s Roundtable</u></a>,&quot; June 19, 2016 (20-minute mark on audio).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email from Kevin Hall, communications director for Mark Warner, June 21, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forbes, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2011/01/21/stock-market-becomes-short-attention-span-theater-of-trading/#600d38317bea\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Stock market becomes short attention theater of trading</u></a>,&quot; Jan. 21, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LPL Financial, &quot;<a href=\"http://moneymattersblog.com/login/login/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/WMC080712.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Weekly Market Commentary</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 6, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yale School of Management, &quot;<a href=\"http://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/does-focusing-shareholder-value-hurt-shareholder-value\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Does focusing on shareholder value hurt shareholder value?</u></a>&quot; Nov. 13, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wall Street Journal, &quot;<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/10/why-hair-trigger-stock-traders-lose-the-race/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Why hair-trigger traders lose the race</u></a>,&quot; April 10, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Stock Exchange, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nyxdata.com/nysedata/asp/factbook/viewer_edition.asp?mode=table&amp;key=3149&amp;category=3\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>NYSE Group turnover, 2010-2016</u></a>,&quot; accessed June 28, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Stock Exchange, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nyxdata.com/nysedata/asp/factbook/viewer_edition.asp?mode=table&amp;key=2206&amp;category=4\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Annual reported volume, turnover rate, reported trades</u></a>,&quot; 1900-2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails from Azar Boehm, communications manager for Credit Suisse, June 29-30, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-05-10/where-has-all-the-stock-trading-gone\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Where has all the stock trading gone?</u></a>&quot; May 10, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The World Bank, &quot;<a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.TRNR?end=2015&amp;locations=US&amp;start=1975\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Stocks traded, turnover ratio of domestic shares,&quot; 1975-2015</u></a>.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Mark", "half_true_count": 6, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 61, "last_name": "Warner", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "mark-warner", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-markwarner.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/61/", "total_count": 23, "true_count": 7, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The average time someone used to hold a share of stock back in the &rsquo;60s was eight years.
