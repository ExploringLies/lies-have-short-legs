Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly -- says Garcia opposes raising the minimum wage, giving women the same pay as men for the same jobs, and gun ownership restrictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giffords is a former Democratic U.S. Representative from a district in Arizona. She was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in Tucson, Ariz., on Jan. 8, 2011, and has since become a leading advocate for preventing gun violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&quot;Marilinda Garcia has some strange ideas,&quot; the ad says. &quot;Most people in New Hampshire want to raise the minimum wage. Garcia opposes it. Most people support guaranteeing women get equal pay for equal work. Garcia&rsquo;s against that, too. Garcia even opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check. Granite Staters deserve commonsense leadership, not Marilinda Garcia.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to check the record on those claims. In this article, we&rsquo;ll take a look at whether Garcia &quot;opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About halfway through the ad, an image is shown of a smiling Garcia holding a pink rifle in front<strong> </strong>of racks of other guns. The printed message says, &quot;Garcia&rsquo;s against closing gun loopholes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lower on the screen, what looks like a newspaper clipping has the headline: &quot;Online ads are the latest way gun buyers can avoid background checks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another common loophole for people to buy firearms without a background check is at gun shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As evidence for its claim, the ad cites an article from <em>The Hill</em>, a Capitol Hill newspaper, titled, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/208740-influential-hispanic-republicans-rally-around-underdog-garcia-in\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Influential Hispanic Republicans rally around underdog Garcia in NH</u></a>&quot; published on June 9.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When contacted, a spokesman for Americans for Responsible Solutions, pointed to the article in <em>The Hill</em> and said that ensuring background checks for all gun sales has widespread support. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The March interview cited by <em>The Hill </em>does not directly address gun show loopholes. Instead, Garcia is quoted as saying that lawmakers are &quot;too reactionary sometimes,&quot; and pointed to the push for new restrictions on gun rights in the New Hampshire House, according to the article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Clearly most of those were connected to mental-health issues, so why don&rsquo;t we first identify what the real problem is before we end up sort of really infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens, because that&rsquo;s what seems to be happening?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s some clearer evidence from Garcia&rsquo;s tenure as a legislator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February 2014, the New Hampshire House killed a bill, HB 1589, that would have required background checks for almost all gun sales. The intention of the law was to &quot;protect public safety by helping to keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill,&quot; according to the <a href=\"http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/amendments/2014-0371H.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>text of the bill</u></a>, which was introduced by eight Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was never a roll call vote on the measure, but when it came time to debate the issue in the House, Second Amendment advocate J.R. Hoell proposed changing the law to &quot;study the correlation between current New Hampshire law and the low violent crime rate in this state.&quot; Such a change would have vastly changed its original aim of requiring background checks for virtually all gun sales. Garcia <a href=\"http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/Roll_calls/billstatus_rcdetails.aspx?vs=68&amp;sy=2014&amp;lb=H&amp;eb=HB1589&amp;sortoption=&amp;txtsessionyear=2014&amp;txtbillnumber=hb1589&amp;ddlsponsors=&amp;q=1&amp;lsr=2269\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>voted in favor</u></a> of the amendment to change the measure, and it passed by two votes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually the bill was scrapped by a vote of 242-118, with individual votes not recorded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently, in an email to PolitiFact, Cunningham didn&rsquo;t offer a specific response to Garcia&rsquo;s position on the issue but instead said, &quot;Decreasing gun violence and maintaining the safety of every American is a top priority, but Marilinda knows that achieving this task does not generally involve imposing federal regulations on the 2nd amendment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Garcia hasn&rsquo;t really supported keeping the &quot;gun show loophole&quot; -- but nor has she clearly advocated getting rid of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the ad&rsquo;s assertion that &quot;dangerous criminals&quot; get their guns through loopholes in the law is somewhat exaggerated. All kinds of people buy weapons at these shows, and that doesn&rsquo;t make them &quot;dangerous criminals.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, experts says the most common ways criminals obtain guns is to get them through straw buyers, through less-than scrupulous online dealers, or by stealing them, according to a <em>Frontline</em> report, titled &quot;<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/guns/procon/guns.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>how criminals get guns</u></a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad claims that Garcia &quot;even opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check.&quot; Her comments on gun control, both past and present, are too vague to draw any real conclusion, but her vote to effectively water down a background-checks bill while serving in the state House does provide some support for the ad&rsquo;s claim. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-03T17:16:37.516948", "ruling_date": "2014-10-03T17:20:47", "ruling_headline": "Gun reform group says GOP candidate for Congress Marilinda Garcia is against closing gun loopholes  ", "ruling_headline_slug": "gun-reform-group-says-gop-candidate-congress-maril", "ruling_link_text": "Close to the mark", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Americans for Responsible Solutions, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF5INgQBbkQ#t=20\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Strange Ideas</u></a>,&quot; YouTube clip, Sep. 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hill, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/208740-influential-hispanic-republicans-rally-around-underdog-garcia-in\" style=\"line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;\"><u>Influential Hispanic Republicans rally around underdog Garcia in NH</u></a>,&quot; June 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frontline, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/guns/procon/guns.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;\"><u>Hot Guns: How criminals get guns</u></a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>NH House of Respresentatives, <a href=\"http://ttp://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/\">roll call votes</a></div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 2667, "last_name": "Americans for Responsible Solutions", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "americans-responsible-solutions", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PolitiFact_silhouette_12.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2667/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://americansforresponsiblesolutions.org/"}, "statement": "<p>Republican House candidate&nbsp;Marilinda Garcia &quot;even opposes closing the loophole that allows dangerous criminals to get a gun without a background check.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an ad", "statement_date": "2014-09-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 19, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/19/", "subject": "Guns", "subject_slug": "guns", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "New Hampshire state representative", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Marilinda", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "New Hampshire", "id": 2579, "last_name": "Garcia", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "marilinda-garcia", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Garcia_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New Hampshire", "edition": "New Hampshire", "edition_slug": "new-hampshire", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 47, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New Hampshire Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/47/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2579/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://elect-mari.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
