Will Alan Grayson change his tune on Obamacare, or be the same broken record?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Florida fact-checked the ad&rsquo;s claim that a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/may/18/us-chamber-commerce/attack-against-alan-grayson-chamber-points-florida/\">Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional</a> and found it Mostly True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor this story we&rsquo;re focused on the ad&rsquo;s first claim that Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/23/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-health-care-law-could-mean-man/\">familiar</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/may/15/us-chamber-commerce/us-chamber-seniors-20-million-health-care-law-lose/\">ground</a> for us, with mixed rulings depending on the context. When Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said &quot;as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance thanks to Obamacare,&quot; we rated the statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/23/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-health-care-law-could-mean-man/\">Half True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen the chamber claimed &quot;20 million people could lose their current coverage&quot; -- and suggested that included seniors who rely on Medicare -- in its anti-Nelson ad, we rated it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/may/15/us-chamber-commerce/us-chamber-seniors-20-million-health-care-law-lose/\">Pants on Fire</a>!<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim in this commercial&rsquo;s context is pretty straight-forward. We&rsquo;ll explain.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe 20-million figure is a projection from nonpartisan researchers at the Congressional Budget Office. You should know CBO has also projected the law will lead to new coverage for about 30 million uninsured Americans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe real issue here is a shift in how some people will get their health insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe RNC previously directed us to a <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/03-15-ACA_and_Insurance.pdf\">March 2012 study by the CBO </a>&nbsp;that aimed to estimate the impact of the health care law on the number of people obtaining health care coverage from their employer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCBO&rsquo;s best guess was that between 3 million to 5 million fewer people, on net, will obtain coverage through their employer from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tCBO supplemented its projection with four alternative scenarios. Among the scenarios: One actually resulted in a net gain of 3 million people with employer-sponsored insurance. The others resulted in a decrease of 10 million, a decrease of 12 million, and -- here it is! -- a decline of 20 million. (Read <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/23/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-health-care-law-could-mean-man/\">this fact-check</a> for more details about the CBO report.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPriebus was partially accurate in his op-ed, but this is the most extreme outcome of five possible outcomes presented, and it&rsquo;s not the primary estimate, which is about 5 million, or one-quarter the number Priebus offered.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tSo Priebus -- and now the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- has engaged in cherry-picking.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s more context to consider. Not everyone who &quot;loses&quot; their employer coverage will do so involuntarily. According to the CBO, some people will spurn their employer&rsquo;s offer of insurance and turn instead to another source, such as the health insurance &quot;exchanges&quot; created under the Obama health care law -- virtual marketplaces for each state where applicants will be able to compare and purchase plans that offer at least a minimum bundle of benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn many cases, they will do this because they consider the employer&rsquo;s offering to be unaffordable or lacking too many features they need. So those people aren&#39;t being forced off the employers&#39; plans; they are choosing to switch.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tPlus, the 20 million figure does not account for the 9 million people who wouldn&rsquo;t have had an employer plan before but will get coverage after passage of the law because of the law&rsquo;s mix of subsidies and penalties for employers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe U.S. Chamber said, &quot;Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage.&quot; It&#39;s a&nbsp;claim that is oft-repeated and much exaggerated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe chamber employs a worst-case projection by a nonpartisan research agency. The agency&rsquo;s other forecasts are lower, but you wouldn&rsquo;t know that from watching the ad. And unlike Priebus, the group does not specify that the type of insurance potentially affected is a specific type of insurance -- &quot;employer-based&quot; insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlus, this 20 million estimate only counts people who receive coverage from their employer -- and not those who might receive better coverage elsewhere.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMost importantly, this figure does not represent uninsured people who will get coverage because of the law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-21T11:43:49.872613", "ruling_date": "2012-05-21T17:37:53", "ruling_headline": "Chamber of Commerce claims 20 million people will lose their current coverage because of health care reform", "ruling_headline_slug": "chamber-commerce-claims-20-million-people-will-los", "ruling_link_text": "This one again?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tYouTube.com, U.S. Chamber of Commerce&rsquo;s Alan Grayson <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_pAhnZ9gEY&amp;list=UUWvLrrkDl8IHkamOq0BOKEA&amp;index=18&amp;feature=plpp_video\">ad</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Orlando Sentinel</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/opinion/os-ed-alan-grayson-tv-ads-myword-051712-20120516,0,5824361.story\">My Word by Alan Grayson: Don&rsquo;t believe the Chamber&rsquo;s TV attack ads</a>,&quot; May 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYoutube.com, Alan Grayson&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-usmvYOPfco\">&quot;die quickly&quot; speech</a>, Sept. 29, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Chamber of Commerce, YouTube ad, &quot;<a href=\"http://youtu.be/fJWUPvaNOt4\">Senator Nelson&#39;s vote for Obamacare can result in millions of seniors losing their health coverage</a>,&quot; May 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office,<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43082\"> CBO and JCT&#39;s Estimates of the Effects of the Affordable Care Act on the Number of People Obtaining Employment-Based Health Insurance</a>, March 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/23/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-health-care-law-could-mean-man/\"> &quot;Reince Priebus says health care law could mean &#39;as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance,&rsquo;&quot;</a> March 23, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "", "id": 210, "last_name": "U.S. Chamber of Commerce", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "us-chamber-commerce", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/Chamber_logo.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/210/", "total_count": 17, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "TV commercial", "statement_date": "2012-05-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
