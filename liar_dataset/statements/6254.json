Chris Christie to the bottom end of the Truth-O-Meter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Republican governor last week repeated a claim about how there are fewer &quot;state government&quot; employees now than when former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman resigned in January 2001.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBetter yet, the state accomplished that reduction &quot;without any layoffs,&quot; Christie said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;New Jersey today has fewer employees in state government than it had when Christie Whitman left office in January of 2001, and I think that&rsquo;s good,&quot; Christie said in a July 9 appearance at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. &quot;And we did it without any layoffs. We did it through attrition.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey issued a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/29/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-new-jersey-has-fewer-state-e/\">True ruling</a> in December on Christie&rsquo;s claim about how state government has fewer employees than when Whitman resigned.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut when we looked at recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that the governor&rsquo;s statement is no longer accurate. Christie&rsquo;s claim about there being no layoffs is wrong too, because his representatives previously cited hundreds of layoffs during his tenure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s explain what&rsquo;s changed since our True ruling.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the time of that ruling, the latest numbers were preliminary estimates for November 2011, showing 137,800 &quot;state government&quot; workers. That figure represented 600 fewer employees than the 138,400 state workers in January 2001.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the November figures have since been revised to show 144,300 workers in that month, exceeding the estimate from January 2001. Every month since November also has shown a greater number of employees than when Whitman resigned.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Christie repeated the claim last week, the latest figures were preliminary estimates for May 2012, when there were 146,100 state government employees. That represents a 7,700 increase, or nearly 5.6 percent, over Whitman&rsquo;s final month.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose statistics are seasonally adjusted and include workers in state departments; the legislative and judicial branches; state colleges and universities; state hospitals and state authorities and commissions, such as NJ Transit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrian Murray, a spokesman with the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, acknowledged how &quot;the Bureau of Labor Statistics has since revised the data and shifted the estimated count of state employees higher.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Murray also pointed to a reduction in employees since the Whitman era in the subcategory of &quot;other state government,&quot; which includes the executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as state boards and authorities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It could be argued that the Governor has more day-to-day control over the workforces in the items included in &lsquo;other state government&rsquo; rather than Educational Services and hospitals,&quot; Murray said in an e-mail.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, in both claims, Christie has just referred to &quot;state government&quot; in general.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, when we referred to that overall category for our first fact-check, a Christie spokesman confirmed that was the source of the governor&rsquo;s information. So, for this fact-check, we&rsquo;re focusing on the same category.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s worth noting that since Christie took office in January 2010, the number of &quot;state government&quot; employees has dropped by 5,600, or nearly 3.7 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut has the Christie administration reduced the state workforce &quot;without any layoffs&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s not what the governor&rsquo;s representatives told us in December when we were working on our first fact-check.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBetween the start of Christie&rsquo;s tenure and November 2011, &quot;743 out of 4,738 full-time positions eliminated were through layoffs,&quot; the spokesmen said in an e-mail, referring to the executive, legislative and judicial branches.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose layoffs included 138 positions at the New Jersey Network, the state-owned TV network shut down at the end of June 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the Brookings Institution, Christie claimed: &quot;New Jersey today has fewer employees in state government than it had when Christie Whitman left office in January of 2001, and I think that&rsquo;s good. And we did it without any layoffs. We did it through attrition.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the latest labor statistics show there were 7,700 more &quot;state government&quot; workers in May than when Whitman resigned. Also, the governor&rsquo;s representatives have cited hundreds of layoffs during Christie&rsquo;s tenure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/07/politifact_nj_chris_christie_c_4.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-13T11:30:12.859967", "ruling_date": "2012-07-16T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie claims New Jersey has reduced the number of state employees without any layoffs to below the level when Christie Whitman resigned", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-claims-new-jersey-has-reduced-numbe", "ruling_link_text": "New numbers, new ruling", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBrookings Institution, <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/multimedia?mm=Videos%2f2012%2f07%2f09%20fiscal%20integrity%20full%20video\">Restoring Fiscal Integrity and Accountability: A Discussion with Governor Chris Christie (R-NJ)</a>, July 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/29/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-new-jersey-has-fewer-state-e/\">Chris Christie claims New Jersey has fewer state employees than when former Gov.
