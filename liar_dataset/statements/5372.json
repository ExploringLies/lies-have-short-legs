Scott Walker and lawmakers of both parties say the state should be doing more, with much debate centered on proposals to boost companies poised for rapid growth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe idea is for the state to use millions of dollars to &quot;seed&quot; venture capital funds -- pools of money that are invested in young firms with high growth potential. But legislation has been bogged down by a debate over whether or not to use state certificated capital companies, or CAPCOs, to handle the investments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA previous $50 million program, which ran from 1999 through 2008, used three out-of-state CAPCO firms and had disappointing results. A Journal Sentinel analysis determined it resulted in the creation of only 202 new jobs at a cost of $247,000 per job. The <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/state-spends-millions-for-202-new-jobs-f4411f2-139170044.html\">Feb. 12, 2012 story </a>said the program was the result of poorly drafted legislation and had minimal state oversight.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe headline: &quot;State spent millions for 202 jobs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFacing a near-certain recall election, Walker that day used his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/GovWalker/status/168845900268056576\">Twitter account</a> to highlight the story as a failure of the previous administration, that of Democrat Jim Doyle. (Other tweets included the fact he stopped for ham and rolls after church.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis tweet: &quot;Headline &lsquo;State spends millions for 202 jobs&rsquo;, missed rest of sentence:, &lsquo;under program approved by Gov Doyle.&rsquo;&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn other words, the poor performing program was created under Doyle. And that&rsquo;s where the blame should fall, Walker says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid Doyle approve the plan?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe legislation creating the program was introduced in 1997 and passed and signed into law the following year -- not by Democrat Doyle, but by then-Gov. Tommy Thompson, a fellow Republican now running for a U.S. Senate vacancy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoyle didn&rsquo;t take office until 2003, five years after the CAPCO bill was signed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, the proposal had bipartisan support. It was authored by Democratic state Sen. Gwen Moore, now a congresswoman from Milwaukee. Among the 89 members of the state Assembly who <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/1997/related/journals/assembly/98_03_25.pdf\">voted in favor of the bill March 25, 1998</a>: Walker himself.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s tweet gained a broader audience the following day. WTMJ radio talk show host Charlie Sykes picked up on the topic and in a <a href=\"http://www.620wtmj.com/podcasts/talk/charliesykes/139232603.html\">three minute segment</a> linked Doyle to the CAPCO program five times. He called it &quot;a Jim Doyle idea,&quot; and said the program was &quot;one of Jim Doyle&rsquo;s signature venture capital bills.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an email, Sykes acknowledged that the program was created under Thompson. And he pointed out that Walker had tweeted on the subject the day before.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie to explain the tweet, but he didn&rsquo;t respond.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the wake of a story about poor jobs results of a state-sponsored program, Walker sought to pin the blame on his predecessor, Jim Doyle. But he was off by five years, two governors -- Thompson and successor Scott McCallum -- and one political party.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs governor, Doyle didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with approving the CAPCO bill. But as an Assembly member, Scott Walker did. Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-02-16T17:36:21.547775", "ruling_date": "2012-02-17T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Gov.
