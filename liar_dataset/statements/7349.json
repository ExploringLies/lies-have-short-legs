Essentially, the court ruled that a guilty plea for child endangerment entered by a Colbert County mother should stand.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmanda Kimbrough initially entered the guilty plea after her son Timmy died 19 minutes after birth at 25 weeks in April 2008. A medical examiner determined that Timmy died from &quot;acute methamphetamine intoxication.&quot; After Kimbrough pleaded guilty to charges under Alabama&rsquo;s chemical endangerment of a child statute, she received the minimum sentence of 10 years. Kimbrough later appealed, saying the chemical endangerment statute did not extend to unborn children.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Alabama ruling included acknowledgment of unborn children in the state&rsquo;s chemical endangerment statute. Anti-abortion advocates immediately praised the decision as a victory for &quot;personhood rights of preborn children.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This is the first time since Roe (v. Wade) was decided in 1973 that a court has granted personhood status to the preborn,&quot; Dan Becker, the president of Georgia Right to Life, said in a news release a few days after the Jan. 11 ruling. &quot;I am greatly encouraged that Georgia, which has proven to be pro-life, will now grant the same protection to our innocent children.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe personhood issue -- defining human life with full rights at the point of conception instead of birth -- has had a long history in this country&rsquo;s abortion debate. Abortion opponents in several states have pursued personhood efforts since the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, we wondered: Could the Alabama ruling be a precedent as Becker said?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKimbrough, the Alabama mother, <a href=\"http://www.waff.com/story/20564163/alabama-supreme-court-unborn-children-protected-by-chemical-endangerment-statute\">admitted</a> smoking methamphetamine three days before her child was born, according to media reports. Alabama&rsquo;s chemical endangerment code prohibits a &quot;responsible person&quot; from &quot;exposing a child to an environment in which (the person) &hellip; knowingly, recklessly, or intentionally causes or permits a child to be exposed to, to ingest or inhale, or to have contact with a controlled substance, chemical substance, or drug paraphernalia.&quot; In the case of a child&rsquo;s death due to these circumstances, the result is a Class A felony with a minimum prison term of 10 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Georgia Right to Life spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia that the organization was not aware of a similar court ruling prior to the Alabama case. &quot;The tide is turning. More and more people are rejecting the culture of death that has existed for far too long,&quot; spokeswoman Suzanne Ward said in an email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPersonhood USA, a Denver-based organization that opposes abortion, supported Becker&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The only personhood effort state-by-state (<a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/23/key-senate-committee-signs-personhood-measure/?page=all\">Virginia</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.gulflive.com/mississippi-press-news/2013/02/personhood_bills_set_to_die_in.html\">Mississippi,</a> for example) &nbsp;that has been done is through Personhood USA, and we haven&rsquo;t gotten anything to pass yet. So right now there are no personhood laws on the books in any state,&quot; said Jennifer Mason, Personhood&rsquo;s communications director.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Alabama decision centered on a chemical endangerment statute. But the court &quot;said women should not take these drugs knowing that they could endanger the child. So it was both a chemical endangerment decision, but also an affirmation of personhood rights for those babies as well,&quot; Mason said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia put the claim to B. Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Law School. Hill disagreed with Becker&rsquo;s statement and cited several other cases, including some cited in the Alabama ruling, in which courts have granted personhood status to the preborn. Among them, a 1997 criminal child neglect <a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15681446953069989830&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\">case</a> in South Carolina involving an expectant mother sentenced to eight years in prison after her child was born with the drug in its system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s not that uncommon (among courts),&quot; Hill said. &quot;Various states have said a fetus could be a child under specific statutes, like criminal child neglect, wrongful death or, in the Alabama case, chemical endangerment.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSteve Crampton, general counsel for Liberty Counsel, which has partnered with Personhood USA on litigation and has worked with Georgia Right to Life, said the Alabama decision &quot;has great potential application&quot; outside the chemical endangerment statute.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat happens next with the Alabama ruling is unknown, said Paul Horwitz, a constitutional law professor at the University of Alabama. &quot;I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a question of a court using the word &lsquo;personhood.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a question of whether or not there is a right to an abortion and when,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&rsquo;t see that larger constitutional issue as something that is automatically teed up in a useful way because of this court&rsquo;s ruling.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo was Georgia Right to Life President Dan Becker correct in saying that an Alabama Supreme Court case last month was &quot;the first time since Roe was decided in 1973 that a court has granted personhood status to the preborn&quot;? Not really.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere have been other cases in other states in the 40 years since Roe v. Wade in which courts have decided that a fetus could be a child. Those cases dealt with specific statutes, including criminal child neglect and wrongful death, which were similar to the Alabama case involving a chemical endangerment statute. But there is no general ruling saying a fetus is a person or granting personhood status to the preborn in all circumstances, according to constitutional and reproductive law experts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecker claimed that no other court had made personhood rulings, but our research found that that is not the case. We rated Becker&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-02-07T16:50:27.070438", "ruling_date": "2013-02-08T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Abortion foe overreaches in describing context of court ruling", "ruling_headline_slug": "abortion-foe-overreaches-describing-context-court-", "ruling_link_text": "Issue has already had its day in court", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNews release, &quot;Georgia Right to Life hails &lsquo;personhood&rsquo; milestone,&quot; Jan. 14, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPR Newswire, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alabama-supreme-court-recognizes-unborn-as-persons-in-landmark-ruling-186615241.html\">Alabama Supreme Court recognizes unborn as persons in landmark ruling</a>,&quot; Jan. 12, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWAFF-TV, &quot;Alabama Supreme Court: Unborn children protected by chemical endangerment statute,&quot; Amanda Jarrett, Jan. 11, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCode of Alabama, Title 26: Infants and Incompetents - <a href=\"http://law.onecle.com/alabama/infants-and-incompetents/26-15-3.2.html\">Section 26-15-3.2</a> - Chemical endangerment<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe New York Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/magazine/the-criminalization-of-bad-mothers.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">The criminalization of bad mothers</a>,&quot; Ada Calhoun, April 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail information, phone interview, Suzanne Ward, spokeswoman, Georgia Right to Life, Feb. 5, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew York Daily News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election-2012/personhood-bills-pushed-u-s-abortion-social-issues-fore-gop-presidential-contest-article-1.1023878\">&lsquo;Personhood&rsquo; bills being pushed in U.S. as abortion, social issues come to fore in GOP presidential contest,</a>&quot; Aliyah Shahid, Feb. 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone interview, Jennifer Mason, communications director, Personhood USA, Feb. 5, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone interview, Paul Horwitz, professor of constitutional law, University of Alabama, Feb. 5, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone interview, B.
