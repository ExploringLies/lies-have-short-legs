Dennis Kucinich, whose heavily Democratic 10th District includes part of Cleveland and several urban suburbs, said the GAO report &quot;did not find waste, fraud and abuse in the administration and delivery of these programs. It does not recommend delivering fewer benefits to those in need.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJordan asked if Kucinich agreed the government should be able to determine if programs are effective and make sure they do not &quot;encourage the wrong kind of behavior.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKucinich replied that the issues can be examined &quot;while we keep feeding people&quot; during a time of continuing need.

The 2009 federal poverty threshold for a family of four with two children was a household &nbsp;income of $21,756.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHigher up the scale of economic well-being is the self-sufficiency level, or the income that a household needs to meet its basic needs without public or private assistance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat is generally considered to be about 200 percent of the federal poverty level, and is a ceiling for eligibility for food assistance programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Ohio Department of Development data shows that in 70 of the state&#39;s 88 counties, at least 25 percent of their citizens live &nbsp;at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level -- and are therefore eligible for emergency food.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe level drops below 20 percent in only three counties -- Medina, Delaware and Warren -- but tops 45 percent in five: Adams, Meigs, Morgan, Pike and Vinton. In rural Morgan County, 51 percent of residents live below the self-sufficiency level.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe data shows that Kucinich&rsquo;s statement is both accurate and not lacking significant details.
