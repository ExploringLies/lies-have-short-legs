The bottom line: Scott says the 7-step plan will create 700,000 new private sector jobs in 7 years. Actually, if you read the plan it says it will only create about 660,000 new jobs, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/jul/26/rick-scott/rick-scott-touts-7-7-7-plan-create-700000-jobs-sev/\">PolitiFact Florida found</a>.

Step 2 of the 7-step plan is to reduce government spending. Included in that section is Scott&#39;s discussion of the state Department of Corrections. <a goog_docs_charindex=\"2313\" href=\"http://www.rickscottforflorida.com/home/turn-florida-around/2-reduce-government-spending/\" id=\"zlpf\" title=\"Here's what he says\">Here&#39;s what he says</a>: &quot;Paying competitive market-based salaries for corrections&#39; staff, utilizing inmate labor to grow prison food, and competitively bidding health care contracts, prisoner costs would be reduced by $1 billion.&quot;<br goog_docs_charindex=\"2542\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"2543\" />\r\n\tEven the thought of cutting $1 billion out of the state Department of Corrections budget, in part by cutting salaries, has raised plenty of objections.

At all. &quot;Nowhere in Rick&#39;s plan does he discuss closing prisons. Rick Scott&#39;s budget &#39;plan&#39; is to take every program and service through accountability budgeting; a cost benefit analysis to determine if tax dollars are being spent most effectively. As part of that process, we will look at what other states are doing well. There are other states that have lower prison budget costs than Florida, because they have some less expensive facilities and have lower recidivism rates. One billion dollars represents the gap between Florida&#39;s and Texas&#39; costs, and is an example of where the accountability budgeting process will begin, but is not a final budget plan.&quot;<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4385\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4386\" />\r\n\t<b goog_docs_charindex=\"4387\">What the PBA says</b><br goog_docs_charindex=\"4406\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4407\" />\r\n\tThe PBA counters that it&#39;s impossible for Scott to cut the budget that much without closing prisons and releasing inmates.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4536\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4537\" />\r\n\tThey point to a quote from prison system spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger, who after digesting Scott&#39;s plan told the <i goog_docs_charindex=\"4651\">Times</i>: &quot;You would have to close prisons.&quot; (That&#39;s what she said).<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4718\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4719\" />\r\n\tPBA executive director David Murrell noted that in 2010, Department of Corrections Secretary Walt McNeil <a goog_docs_charindex=\"4825\" href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/state/doc-secretary-prison-privatization-could-mean-releasing-inmates-480670.html\" id=\"crrd\" title=\"talked about\">talked about</a> having to close five state prisons and release 2,519 prisoners early when the Senate was debating shedding $100 million from the DOC budget.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4981\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"4982\" />\r\n\t<a goog_docs_charindex=\"4983\" href=\"http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/timeserv/doing/\" id=\"hi::\" title=\"State law requires\">State law requires</a> prisoners who committed crimes on or after Oct. 1, 1995, to serve 85 percent of their sentence before being released, but that might need to be waived to comply with a court order related to prison overcrowding, McNeil said.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"5228\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"5229\" />\r\n\t&quot;Multiply a $100 million cut by 10 ($1 billion) and you have tens of thousands of inmates released to overcrowding,&quot; Murrell said.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"5360\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"5361\" />\r\n\tScott also promises voters in his 7-7-7 plan that he will cut the state workforce 5 percent.

It calls for cutting $1 billion from the Department of Corrections budget, but not by closing prisons and releasing inmates.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"7037\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"7038\" />\r\n\tThat&#39;s immediately misleading in the PBA ad.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"7083\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"7084\" />\r\n\tWhen we asked whether Scott wants to, plans on, or will agree to release inmates early, the answer was no.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"7191\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"7192\" />\r\n\tBut the PBA argues there is no other way to cut $1 billion from the department&#39;s $2.4 billion budget. And maybe, they have a point.<br goog_docs_charindex=\"7324\" />\r\n\t<br goog_docs_charindex=\"7325\" />\r\n\tPolitiFact Florida looked at the numbers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne of the ways Scott says he&#39;ll save $1 billion is by paying corrections employees competitively. Currently, the agency spends more than $1.5 billion on salaries and benefits for its nearly 27,700 employees. If Scott cut the compensation package for each and every employee 10 percent, the state would save $151 million in total, using DOC budget figures. That&#39;s less than one-fifth of the way to $1 billion. And that&#39;s using the example of a hefty 10 percent pay cut.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnother way Scott wants to save money is by having inmates grow their own food. But having inmates in charge of their own meals may only provide minor cost savings. The agency fired two private food service vendors two years ago and now cooks all prison meals in house to save money. The daily food cost per inmate in August 2010 was $2.30.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Department of Corrections also already grows its own food. <a href=\"http://www.dc.state.fl.us/oth/Quickfacts.html\">Inmates harvested</a> over 4.7 million pounds of produce last year, including broccoli, cabbage, cantaloupe, and watermelon. The crops supplement inmate meals, but cannot sustain inmates because of unpredictable weather and the large inmate population, officials said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe agency is also already competitively bidding some of its health care contracts, which is the third part of Scott&#39;s plan to reduce costs. Contracts for lab services, X-rays and pharmaceuticals are competitively bid, said DOC spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger. Contracts for physicians and hospitals are negotiated on a percentage of Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe agency spent a total of $413 million in health care costs, including for employees, last year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the DOC, it costs an average $52.00 a day or $18,980 per year to house an inmate in a Florida prison. The Department of Justice, in 2006, said Florida&#39;s cost per prisoner was $71.93 -- <a href=\"http://www.rickscottforflorida.com/home/blog/2010/09/14/scott-campaign-responds-to-sink-surrogate-lies-scare-tactics/\">Scott relies on that number</a>, not the state produced figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn its ad, the Florida Police Benevolent Association says &quot;Rick Scott&#39;s prison plan would cut Florida&#39;s prison budget in half, close prisons, and release tens of thousands of prisoners early.&quot; That&#39;s a prediction more than anything, though it doesn&#39;t come across that way in the 30-second commercial.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott&#39;s plan is to cut the prison budget by 40 percent, but not by closing prisons or releasing prisoners early. The Scott campaign maintains they can reach their targeted spending levels without closing prisons or releasing prisoners early, and has taken the option of releasing inmates off the table.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe PBA is editorializing, in essence, what would happen if Scott is elected and has a say over the Department of Corrections budget. At PolitiFact Florida, we shy away from trying predictions, so we&#39;re specifically not ruling on what would happen if the state cuts $1 billion out of its prison budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we can say the PBA is about right on the size of the budget cuts being suggested by Scott, and wrong that&#39;s Scott&#39;s plan is to close prisons and release inmates. We rate the group&#39;s claim Barely True.</p>\r\n\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
