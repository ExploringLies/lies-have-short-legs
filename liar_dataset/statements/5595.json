Bill Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) pointed to that statistic during a Feb. 23 debate against U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman at Passaic County Community College in Paterson. The two Democrats will face off on June 5 for their party&rsquo;s nomination to represent the newly redrawn 9th Congressional District.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Pascrell campaign on March 3 posted video clips of the debate on the campaign&rsquo;s YouTube channel, including one in which the congressman discussed his commitment to helping small businesses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;And what I am saying to you is that I have an obligation and a responsibility as a congressman to find ways to help small business,&quot; Pascrell told the crowd. &quot;Ninety percent of the people who work in this country work for companies under 100 people, maybe even less than that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Pascrell&rsquo;s claim is way off, because such companies employed about 35 percent of U.S. workers in 2009, according to business statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis is the second time in less than two months that we&rsquo;ve debunked one of Pascrell&rsquo;s statistics on small businesses. In February, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/24/bill-pascrell/bill-pascrell-claims-heath-care-bills-forced-62-pe/\">we gave him a False</a> for claiming 62 percent of small businesses closed during the past five years because of health care bills.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLet&#39;s explain his latest misstatement about workers at companies with fewer than 100 employees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2009, businesses with fewer than 100 employees employed 40,128,249 workers, according to the census bureau. That&rsquo;s about 35 percent of the 114,509,626 workers included in the census data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose statistics exclude certain industries and most government employees, but are considered the &quot;standard reference source for small business statistics,&quot; according to the census bureau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPascrell campaign spokesman Sean Darcy acknowledged that the congressman &quot;misspoke&quot; and said he meant to say &quot;businesses with fewer than 500 employees represent 99.7 percent of all employer firms.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat statistic is accurate. According to the census bureau, of the 5,767,306 employer firms in 2009, 5,749,797 had fewer than 500 employees.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThose businesses with fewer than 500 employees employed about half of the nation&rsquo;s workforce included in the census data.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBefore we get to our ruling, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the Pascrell campaign later made the video private on its YouTube channel. So, if you go looking for it now, it&rsquo;s not there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDarcy told us the video was originally marked public by mistake. He provided this explanation in an e-mail:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We have a number of videos on that youtube channel marked private. We use it as a vehicle for the campaign to all view content without having to be in the same location. It is a common practice.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We have a huge amount of public content on-line on our pascrell for congress facebook page and our pascrell web pages and have been using these sites as a vehicle to get the campaign&#39;s message out. Not sure how you came across the one video that was on there in error but, essentially, you found a staff mistake.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a Feb. 23 debate with Congressman Steve Rothman, Pascrell claimed: &quot;Ninety percent of the people who work in this country work for companies under 100 people, maybe even less than that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut according to the U.S. Census Bureau, businesses with fewer than 100 employees employed about 35 percent of American workers in 2009.
