It just does not make any sense.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt goes on to say, &quot;Many citizens had no idea that members of Congress could retire with the same pay after only one term.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor a rank-and-file member of the House of Representatives paid $174,000 per year, that would mean full pay for the rest of their lives after serving as little as two years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat a deal! But is it a real deal? We wanted to find out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt didn&#39;t take us long to uncover a federal report, released in January, on &quot;<a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%270E%2C*PLC8%22%40%20%20%0A\">Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress</a>&quot; prepared for Congress by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. It outlines how pension benefits are calculated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe key provision: no member of Congress is eligible for any pension unless he or she has served in Congress for at least five years. (Senators serve six-year terms; House members must seek reelection every two years.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo collect, a congressman or senator must be age 62, or be age 50 with 20 years of service, or be any age with 25 years of service.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnder the most recent pension program, adopted in 1984, the size of a pension is based on the highest three years of a member&#39;s salary, the number of years of service and a multiplier, which is 1.7 percent for the first 20 years of service and 1.0 percent for subsequent years. (Typically, for a 25-year rank-and-file member who retired this year, the pension would be the sum of two calculations. First, take $172,443 [the average salary over the last three years] times 20 years times 0.017. Then, add that to $172,443 times 5 years times 0.01. The total: $67,249 per year.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA three-term congressman (or one-term senator) who has now reached retirement age would be eligible for an annual pension of $17,588 for six years of work. That&#39;s extremely generous, but not even close to full pay. (Members of Congress are also eligible for Social Security.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, federal law prevents them from getting full-pay retirement when they leave office. The report says, &quot;By law, the starting amount of a member&#39;s retirement annuity may not exceed 80 percent of his or her final salary.&quot; (Under the formula, it would take 67 years of service to hit that limit.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo the email saying that members of Congress can &quot;receive full pay retirement after serving one term&quot; is blatantly bogus. It&#39;s never full pay and the only one-term members who would be eligible for any pension would be senators.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis claim has been around the rotunda a few times. Our friends at <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/socialsecurity/pensions.asp\">Snopes.com</a> have emails dating to 2000 reporting that senators and congressmen, when they retire, continue to draw the same paycheck until they die. <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/does_a_united_states_senator_receive_his.html\">FactCheck.org has also debunked the email</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the years the claim has been accompanied by assertions that members of Congress don&#39;t pay into their Social Security (<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/socialsecurity/pensions.asp\">they have since 1984</a>) or they don&#39;t contribute anything toward their retirement (<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/socialsecurity/pensions.asp\">they do</a>), or that they are exempt from the new health-care law or claims of sexual harassment (they&#39;re not).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA quick Google search with the words &quot;congress&quot; &quot;full&quot; &quot;pay&quot; and &quot;retirement&quot; would reveal the truth. But too many people prefer to make the seat-of-the-slacks decision to simply spread the myth to family and friends.
