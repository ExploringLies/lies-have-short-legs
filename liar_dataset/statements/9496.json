I have no savings accounts. But I got a great pension, and I got a good salary,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though Biden was known as one of the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/27/howard-dean/we-should-all-be-so-poor/\"><u>poorest members of Congress</u></a> while he was a senator, the statement raised some eyebrows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just last week, we rated Clinton&#39;s claim that she and former President Bill Clinton were &quot;dead broke&quot; when they left the White House as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-and-bill-were-dead-broke/\"><u>Mostly False</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do Biden&rsquo;s finances stack up?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8WjJZV5haA\"><u>North American International Auto Show</u></a> in January, Biden said that when he first ran for office in 1972, he promised he would never own any stocks or bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden&rsquo;s office declined to comment on the record about his finances and whether or not he lived up to that promise. But we were able to look at Biden&rsquo;s 2013 executive branch personnel <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/vp_certified_278_cy2013.pdf\"><u>public financial disclosure report</u></a>, which was submitted just last month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report lists about a dozen investments, all of which fall into the $1,001 - $15,000 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, they&#39;re not strictly his.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All 11 are designated by the letter &quot;S&quot;-- used to <a href=\"http://www.oge.gov/Forms-Library/Warning-about-Saving-OGE-Form-278/\"><u>indicate</u></a> that the holding belongs to the filer&rsquo;s spouse. That means the 11 investments are owned by Jill Biden, his wife of 37 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the savings accounts are a different story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the disclosure documents, the Bidens have five savings accounts, which fall into a larger range. Some amounted to less than $1,001, while others fell into the $50,001 - $100,000 category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four of the five accounts belong to the vice president&#39;s wife, while the final one has the classification &quot;J&quot; -- a joint account that belongs to both of them. This U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union account&#39;s holdings fall into the $1,001 - $15,000 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if the investments aren&#39;t in the vice president&#39;s name, they are part of his household wealth, and he stands to benefit from their success, said George Pennacchi, a finance professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeffrey Hoopes, an accounting professor at Ohio State University, compared the situation to a household with two cars -- where each spouse drives a car, but both titles are only in the husband&#39;s name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For (the wife) to say she did not own a car would be slightly disingenuous, even if legally true,&quot; Hoopes said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, pension funds invest in stocks and bonds or other assets, Pennacchi said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Thus, it is inescapable that Mr. Biden&rsquo;s wealth is both directly and indirectly linked to stock and bond investments,&quot; Pennacchi said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden also holds four checking accounts, two of which he shares with his wife. In addition, he holds six life insurance policies with Mass Mutual. <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/image/2013_vpotus_tax_returns.pdf\"><u>The Bidens reported</u></a> an adjusted gross income of $407,099 last year, including his vice presidential salary of $230,700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden said, &quot;I don&#39;t own a single stock or bond... I have no savings accounts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden was wrong to say that he doesn&#39;t have a savings account because he shares one with his wife. However, he doesn&#39;t have ownership over any stocks and bonds -- those all belong to his wife. We rate his statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-06-24T10:21:24.526890", "ruling_date": "2014-06-24T11:41:29", "ruling_headline": "Biden says he has no stocks, bonds or savings accounts", "ruling_headline_slug": "biden-says-he-has-no-stocks-bonds-or-savings-accou", "ruling_link_text": "The stocks and bonds are his wife's, but he has a savings account", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"about:blank\"><u>No, Joe Biden isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;Hillary Clinton&rsquo; Wealthy</u></a>,&quot; June 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post,</em><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/06/23/joe-biden-said-he-has-no-savings-accounts/?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost%20\"><em> </em>&quot;<u>Joe Biden said he has &lsquo;no savings accou</u></a><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/06/23/joe-biden-said-he-has-no-savings-accounts/?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost \"><u>nt</u></a>,&rsquo;&quot; June 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/23/joe-biden-im-poorest-man-congress/\"><u>Biden one-ups &lsquo;dead broke&rsquo; Hillary by boasting he&rsquo;s &lsquo;the poorest man in Congress</u></a>,&rsquo;&quot; June 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-doesnt-have-a-savings-account/\"><u>Joe Biden doesn&rsquo;t have a savings account?</u></a>&quot; June 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>PolitiFact</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/27/howard-dean/we-should-all-be-so-poor/\"><u>We should all be so poor</u></a>,&quot; August 27, 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Office of Government Ethics, <a href=\"http://www.oge.gov/Forms-Library/Warning-about-Saving-OGE-Form-278/\"><u>OGE Form 278</u></a>, accessed June 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Office of Government Ethics, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/vp_certified_278_cy2013.pdf\"><u>Biden&rsquo;s 2013 executive branch personnel public financial disclosure report</u></a>, May 12, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/image/2013_vpotus_tax_returns.pdf\"><u>Biden&rsquo;s 2013 Tax Returns</u></a>, April 8, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Brian Mittendorf, accounting professor at Ohio State University, June 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jeffrey Hoopes, accounting professor at Ohio State University, June 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with George Pennacchi, finance professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, June 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Miriam Diemer, researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, June 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Biden spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff, June 23, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "U.S. senator", "false_count": 10, "first_name": "Joe", "half_true_count": 21, "home_state": "Delaware", "id": 11, "last_name": "Biden", "mostly_true_count": 16, "name_slug": "joe-biden", "pants_count": 4, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-joebiden.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/11/", "total_count": 78, "true_count": 13, "website": "http://www.joebiden.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;I don&#39;t own a single stock or bond &hellip; I have no savings accounts.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "the White House Summit on Working Families", "statement_date": "2014-06-23", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 35, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/35/", "subject": "Ethics", "subject_slug": "ethics", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 184, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/184/", "subject": "Income", "subject_slug": "income", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 107, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/107/", "subject": "Transparency", "subject_slug": "transparency", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
