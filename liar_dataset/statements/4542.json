The two were criticizing the federal law, warning that it will be too costly to taxpayers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGlover talked about how when she was younger, she couldn&rsquo;t afford health insurance but managed to get by -- by tapping her savings to pay for doctor&rsquo;s bills with cash.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;How do we pay for it?&quot; Glover asked about the new health care system and the planned exchanges that are an attempt to provide affordable insurance to the masses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter a commercial break, Glover said that Gallagher &quot;was just telling me that a family of four can make up to $88,000 a year and still get a subsidy for health insurance, which of course begs the question, who is paying for that in the long run? We all know that all of us are.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;re not going to delve into a debate about whether the health care law is going to save the country money or cost &nbsp;more by extending coverage to millions of uninsured Americans. But we were curious whether a family with that much income would truly qualify for a federal subsidy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut before we hook up the Truth-O-Meter to Glover&rsquo;s statement, let&rsquo;s first revisit the basics of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which President Obama signed into law March 23, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne of its centerpieces is the so-called &quot;individual mandate.&quot; Beginning in 2014, most U.S. citizens will be required to obtain health insurance, according to <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8061.pdf\">a summary of the law published by the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, an often-cited source of information on health care policy. If they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;ll face penalties that by 2016 will rise to $695 or 2.5 percent of taxable income for individuals, whichever is greater.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEnter the exchanges. Their purpose is to create a marketplace that helps keep costs down by spurring competition between insurers while delivering to them vast numbers of consumers, including younger healthy people, many of whom lack insurance now.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExchanges will be established in every state, with the federal government stepping in to create ones in states that opt not to participate. Rhode Island was moving toward establishing a state-based health-benefits exchange when Gallagher appeared on Glover&rsquo;s show on Sept. 7. (On Sept. 20, Governor Chafee issued an executive order directing the establishment of an exchange.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth individuals and small businesses will be able to purchase coverage through exchanges when they open in 2014.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile the exchanges are intended to be affordable, it&rsquo;s expected that plenty of people will still need financial assistance. That&rsquo;s where the federal subsidies come in.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCalled &quot;premium tax credits,&quot; the subsidies will be offered to income-eligible consumers who purchase insurance through an exchange. The credits will be paid directly to an insurer to help families that might not have the cash to make timely payments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo back to Glover&rsquo;s statement. Would a family of four making $88,000 a year qualify for the subsidies? The short answer is yes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe guidelines are spelled out clearly in the Kaiser summary, as well as at <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/2011/08/exchanges08122011a.html\">HealthCare.gov</a>, a Web site of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey state that taxpayers with household incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level -- $89,400 a year for a family of four in 2011, according to the U.S. Treasury Department -- will be eligible for credits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFamilies at that level would contribute 9.5 percent of their income -- $8,493 -- &nbsp;to their health insurance premium. The tax credit would cover the remainder.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose with lower incomes would contribute less and get bigger credits. A family at poverty level -- $22,350 for a family of four -- would contribute 2 percent of their income, about $447.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Treasury Department, i<a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/Documents/36BFactSheet.pdf\">n an Aug. 12 notice</a>, noted that the Congressional Budget Office estimates that individuals receiving tax credits will get an average subsidy of more than $5,000 per year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGlover, quoting a talk show guest, said a family of four with an income of $88,000 would be eligible for a health insurance subsidy. That figure is actually $1,400 below the threshold to receive a subsidy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd it&rsquo;s in 2011 dollars, meaning that by 2014, when exchanges are scheduled to begin operation, it could be adjusted upward to reflect inflation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile the diagnostic services of our Truth-O-Meter are not covered by any known health plan, we administer them freely.
