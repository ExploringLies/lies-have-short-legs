The email message was sent as part of a fundraising plea and signed by the PAC&rsquo;s chairwoman, Lauren Benedict.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Rep. Phil Gingrey is promoting the teaching of gender stereotypes in elementary schools. He wants public schools to teach women to &lsquo;stay in their place,&rsquo; &quot; the email said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Your gift of $50, $100, &nbsp;or $250 will help us show these men that a woman&rsquo;s &lsquo;place&rsquo; is in the House and in the Senate!&quot; the message ends.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Stay in their place&quot; and &quot;place&quot; were in single quotes in the email.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGingrey, one of four major Republican candidates running in Georgia for the Senate, has already made a name for himself in the questionable statements category. Earlier this year, he said &nbsp;Senate candidate Todd Akin of Missouri was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2013/jan/16/phil-gingrey/gingrey-defense-akins-rape-comments-misses-mark/\">&quot;partly right&quot;</a> that a woman&rsquo;s body has a way of shutting down if she&rsquo;s raped to prevent pregnancy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe wondered whether Gingrey had again made controversial statements about women. Did he really say schools should teach them to &quot;stay in their place?&quot; &nbsp;We decided to take a closer look.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA day after Benedict&rsquo;s PAC sent out its anti-Gingrey email, Better Georgia -- a left-leaning political group -- sent out its own email/fundraising message opposing conservative Georgia congressmen. That group said that the men, including Gingrey, want to be sure that women &quot;know their place.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut what exactly did Gingrey say?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA review of the <a href=\"http://houselive.gov/\">tape</a> shows that Gingrey spends part of his time talking about Father&rsquo;s Day and his own family. He admits that the old family model that was illustrated in television classics like &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; are outdated, but he holds firm to his belief that families need a mother and a father to work well.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;You know, maybe part of the problem is we need to go back into the schools ... and have a class for the young girls and have a class for the young boys and say ... what&rsquo;s important,&quot; Gingrey said. &quot;This is what a father does that is maybe a little different, maybe a little bit better than the talents that a mom has in a certain area. And the same thing for the young girls, that ... this is what a mom does, and this is what is important from the standpoint of that union which we call marriage.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRecord of his comments quickly made headlines and were picked up by several news outlets, including Fox News and the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/19/phil-gingrey-doma-gender-roles_n_3466605.html?utm_hp_ref=tw\">Huffington Post</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia &nbsp;reviewed a video of Gingrey&rsquo;s remarks several times. And we found that he &nbsp;never used the phrase about women that they should &quot;stay in their place&quot; or &quot;know their place.&quot; We asked Benedict about the PAC&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn an email to us, Benedict -- who is also a member of the Macon City Council -- said the use of single quotes around the phrase was for emphasis and not intended to be a direct quote of Gingrey&rsquo;s comments. She says Gingrey&rsquo;s recommendation for the gender classes presents a 1950s view of marriage.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;What else, other than the desire for women to stay in their place, can be inferred from these statements and Gingrey&rsquo;s desire to have separate classes to teach traditional gender roles,&quot; Benedict wrote.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGingrey&rsquo;s spokeswoman, Jen Talaber, provided us with a statement similar to what was provided to another Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/political-insider/2013/jun/19/phil-gingrey-calls-elementary-school-class-gender-/\">last week</a>. She did not address specific questions about the criticism and it being used in fundraiser statements.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Phil is a strong supporter of traditional marriage and believes strong male and female role models are essential in a child&rsquo;s development. Phil was speaking theoretically to emphasize his point that kids learn different things from their mothers and fathers,&quot; the statement said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitical parties send out this type of &quot;red meat&quot; rhetoric to solicit funds and energize their party base, their most loyal voters, said Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Both parties will try and make the other look as extreme as possible,&quot; he said. &quot;In this case, they are making the case for extremism against women.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, does the Democratic PAC&rsquo;s claim measure up?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn an email, a leader at Georgia&rsquo;s WIN List said that Gingrey wanted public schools to teach women to &quot;stay in their place.&quot; The group said that the phrase &quot;to stay in their place&quot; was for emphasis and not a direct quote from Gingrey. Video of the congressman&rsquo;s comments show that he did not use this phrase.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGingrey did make statements about gender roles that some critics found offensive.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut Benedict quotes Gingrey as mouthing specific words that he did not utter.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate her statement Pants On Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-06-25T17:06:34.829631", "ruling_date": "2013-06-26T10:39:35", "ruling_headline": "Fundraising email puts words in Gingrey\u2019s mouth", "ruling_headline_slug": "fundraising-email-puts-words-gingreys-mouth", "ruling_link_text": "All style, no substance", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid--be2903e-8bbf-3d43-c2e8-1a77f4ebed1b\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tEmail, Georgia&rsquo;s WIN List, received June 19, 2013</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tEmail, Better Georgia, received June 20, 2013</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tHuffington Post Politics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/19/phil-gingrey-doma-gender-roles_n_3466605.html?utm_hp_ref=tw\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Phil Gingrey, in DOMA speech, says children should take classes on traditional gender roles</a>,&quot; Laura Bassett, June 19, 2013</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tU.S. House of Representatives, Office of the Clerk,<a href=\"http://houselive.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> HouseLive</a> online session from June 18, 2013</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tEmail response, Lauren Benedict, chairwoman, Georgia&rsquo;s WIN List, June 24, 2013</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tEmail response, Jen Talaber, spokeswoman, U.S. Rep.
