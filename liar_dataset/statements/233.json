To defend his position, Hunter tapped a reliable and potent source to justify weaving church and state: George Washington.\n<p>\n \"This is supposedly done under the separation of church and state, but you can't separate a veteran from his flag,\" Hunter told interviewer Bill Hemmer. \"And, you know, our first president and our first commander in chief prayed every day. He had a field manual of prayers.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Whether Hunter knew it or not, Washington wasn't the most religious founding father. And the story of his personal prayer book was debunked in the early 20th century.\n</p>\n<p>\n His remarks actually tap into a debate among scholars about the extent of Washington's religious convictions. Many argue he was more a deist than a Christian.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"It's a tricky area that keeps coming up again and again,\" said Phil Chase, a senior editor at the Papers of George Washington Project at the University of Virginia. \"People tend to attribute their own views to someone in the past. ... It happens a lot with Washington.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Evangelical minister Tim LaHaye, author of the\n <i>\n  Left Behind\n </i>\n series, is the latest. In his book about the founding father's faith, LaHaye wrote that the fact that Washington \"was a devout believer in Jesus Christ and had accepted Him as His Lord and Saviour is easily demonstrated by a reading of his personal prayer book, written in his own handwriting.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Except that's not true. Washington scholar Rupert Hughes wrote in 1926 that no evidence connects Washington to this prayer book, which was found nearly a century after his death in a old trunk. Hughes consulted a penmanship expert who proved it wasn't even in Washington's handwriting.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"We are very confident that this prayer book is not Washington's prayer book,\" Chase said.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fortunately for Hunter, it's a common myth. Otherwise, we might give him a Pants-on-Fire ruling.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:29.508061", "ruling_date": "2007-12-18T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Hunter perpetuates common myth", "ruling_headline_slug": "hunter-perpetuates-common-myth", "ruling_link_text": "Hunter perpetuates common myth", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Fox News transcript, CQ Transcripts Wire, Oct. 31, 2007\n<p>\n Interview with Phil Chase, senior editor, the Papers of George Washington Project at University of Virginia\n</p>\n<p>\n \"Faith of Our Founding Fathers,\" by Tim LaHaye, 1996\n</p>\n<p>\n \"The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents,\" by Frank Steiner, 1936\n</p>\n<p>\n \"George Washington: The Human Being and the Hero (Vol. 1),\" by Rupert Hughes, 1926\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "U.S. representative", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Duncan", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "California", "id": 18, "last_name": "Hunter", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "duncan-hunter", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Duncan_sr.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/18/", "total_count": 5, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "\"And, you know, our first president and our first commander in chief prayed every day.
