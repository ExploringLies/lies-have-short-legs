John Thrasher came to the state Senate floor on May 3, 2011, to try to put teeth back into a watered-down immigration bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill -- which has been one of the more controversial of the 2011 legislative session -- had been stripped of a requirement that private employers use the federal E-Verify system to check a worker&#39;s immigration status. Rather than try to restore the mandate, Thrasher instead tried to offer employers a strong incentive to voluntarily use the system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUse it, or risk being fined.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThrasher&#39;s amendment would have created noncriminal fines for employers who are found to have employed a nondocumented worker and had not screened that employee through the E-Verify system. Thrasher explained that the employer would receive fines escalating from $500 to $1,500 for multiple instances of hiring illegal workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeveral Republicans opposed the amendment, which ultimately failed 23-16, but not before Thrasher tried to sway votes by saying E-Verify could have prevented the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring his closing argument, Thrasher reminded people that the United States had -- after 10 years and millions and millions of dollars -- found and killed 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden on May 1, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I want to remind everyone in here that 10 of the 19 terrorists who attacked our country, directed by Osama bin Laden in doing that, lived in the state of Florida,&quot; Thrasher said. &quot;I wish we would have had the E-Verify system. ... We might have saved the lives of 3,000 Americans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMatt Dixon of the <em>Florida Times-Union</em> spoke with Thrasher after his comments and asked for him to clarify his statement. Thrasher said that &quot;several of them (the hijackers) had jobs,&quot; and might have been flagged by the E-Verify system. He also said that an earlier version of the bill had stronger requirements for law enforcement officials to use E-Verify and might have helped catch the 9/11 plotters.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA staggering claim about E-Verify and 9/11. But true?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, the E-Verify system is a federal database that compares information from a person&#39;s employment paperwork to the Department of Homeland Security and Social Security records. Employers&nbsp;use the program to weed out immigrants not eligible to work in this country. Once employers hire workers, they run their names through the E-Verify database. If the records match, the new employees are eligible to work. If they don&#39;t match, the database notifies the employers, who must then give the workers eight days to provide sufficient proof of eligibility.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA pilot program of what is now the E-Verify system launched in 1997 in several states -- including Florida -- and the program expanded to all 50 states by 2004. In 2004, 3,500 employers were authorized the system. More than 200,000 employers are now registered to use E-Verify.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.fairus.org/site/PageServer?pagename=iic_immigrationissuecentersc582\">As for the 9/11 terrorists, Thrasher actually understates the connection to Florida</a>. At least 14 of the 19 hijackers either spent time in Florida, or had Florida driver&#39;s licenses or identification cards. Among the people living in Florida were Mohammed Atta, who piloted American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston into the World Trade Center&#39;s north tower; Marwan al-Shehhi, who piloted United Airlines Flight 175 from Boston into the World Trade Center&#39;s south tower; and Ziad Samir Jarwan, the pilot of United Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe three pilots received their pilot training in Florida.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe question here, however, is if any of the hijackers could have been flagged by the E-Verify system. In order to do that, they would have needed to try to get a job.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther than one hijacker, Hani Hanjour, <a href=\"http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/staff_statement_1.pdf\">the 9/11 conspirators entered the United States legally by obtaining tourist visas</a>. Hanjour used a student visa. It&#39;s important when considering Thrasher&#39;s claim <a href=\"http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1262.html\">because people entering the country on tourist visas are not allowed to work for U.S. employers.</a> E-Verify or no E-Verify.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the majority of the hijackers, <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/2002/DCI_18_June_testimony_new.pdf\">13 of the 19, entered the country in the spring or summer of 2001</a>, just months before the Sept. 11 attack.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means most of the hijackers would have been here for just a few months. Logic suggests they wouldn&#39;t have needed jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd in fact, they did not. The 9/11 Commission, the group formed to better understand the plot and how it could have been prevented, reported that the plotters spent somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct their attack, and that the money came directly from al-Qaida operatives. <a href=\"http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf\">The commission concluded al-Qaida provided the hijackers</a> &quot;with nearly all of the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live.&quot; The money arrived either through wire transfers or cash, the commission concluded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf all of the hijackers, there is evidence that only one actually worked for a U.S. employer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNawaf Al-Hazmi, a hijacker on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon, did work at a San Diego-area Texaco station and car wash for about a month in early 2000. Al-Hazmi worked at minimum wage two days a week, vacuuming and drying cars, the <em>Washington Post </em>reported. Al-Hazmi&#39;s employment is corroborated in the 9/11 Commission&#39;s findings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAl-Hazmi was in the country on an expired tourist visa.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd he is one of the hijackers with a Florida connection. Al-Hazmi obtained a Florida driver&#39;s license on June 25, 2001, in Palm Beach County.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that was more than a year after he worked briefly at the California gas station.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo recap, Thrasher said: &quot;I want to remind everyone in here that 10 of the 19 terrorists who attacked our country, directed by Osama bin Laden in doing that, lived in the state of Florida. I wish we would have had the E-Verify system ... we might have saved the lives of 3,000 Americans.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHijackers did live in Florida and obtain Florida driver&#39;s licenses. But in order to potentially be flagged by the E-Verify system, they would have had to work in the state. There is no record that any of them ever tried to get jobs here.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>And as such, E-Verify -- had it been used by Florida employers as Thrasher wanted -- wouldn&#39;t have found them or stopped their plotting.
