If they can&rsquo;t do that, the email says, their car is towed -- and proof of insurance is required to retrieve the car.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd, the email continues: &quot;Shortly after the &quot;No Insurance&quot; ordinance was passed, the Dallas impound lots began to fill up and (they) were full after only nine days. 80&quot;-plus percent &quot;of the impounded cars were driven by illegal&rsquo;s,&quot; an indecorous (and ungrammatical) reference to undocumented residents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe chain email&rsquo;s claims have been posted at least 50 times since Sept. 2010. We saw it on websites like <a href=\"http://www.sodahead.com/united-states/dallas-texas-towing-uninsured-motorist-dallas-txs-solution-to-illegals-brilliant/question-1479765/?page=2\">Sodahead.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/d/Dallas-Tow-Law.htm\">Truthorfiction.com</a> and in myriad <a href=\"http://www.seattlebuzz.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;t=18119&amp;start=420\">online forums</a>. None of the posts offered backup information.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked, and found Dallas indeed has such an ordinance. According to an online city summary, the ordinance <a href=\"http://www.dallascityhall.com/police/towing.HTML\">says</a> that &nbsp;&quot;drivers stopped for a traffic violation who cannot show proof of auto insurance meeting state requirements will be issued a citation and will have his or her vehicle towed at the owner&rsquo;s expense.&quot; However, The Dallas Morning News reported in a Dec. 30, 2008 news article that police officers may use discretion in deciding whether the car will be impounded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a telephone interview, Mitchell Rasansky, a former Dallas City Council member and a champion of the <a href=\"http://www.dallascityhall.com/police/pdfs/towing_ordinance.pdf\">2008</a> ordinance, said that &nbsp;he offered the change because &quot;the people who are really being hurt by (uninsured motorists) are the middle- and lower-income people who get hit, and somebody who hit them doesn&rsquo;t have insurance.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRasanky said he was unaware of how many cars have since been impounded or if affected drivers included many illegal immigrants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott Walton, spokesman for the Dallas Police Department, separately told us: &quot;If you&rsquo;ve ever been in an accident and found that the other person is not insured, it really does put a financial burden on you.The city really wants to make sure that anyone traveling through Dallas meets state requirements and don&rsquo;t get put in that situation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince 1982, it&rsquo;s been <a href=\"http://www.tdi.texas.gov/auto/youngfaqauto.html#1\">against Texas law</a> to drive without being able to pay for accidents one causes, a <a href=\"http://www.tdi.texas.gov/pubs/consumer/cb088.pdf\">requirement </a>most residents meet by having auto insurance, according to John Greeley, a public information officer at the Texas Department of Insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAustin police issue tickets to such drivers, according to Austin Police Department spokeswoman Veneza Aguinaga, but vehicles aren&rsquo;t impounded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCars that are towed by law enforcement are taken to the Dallas Police Department&rsquo;s auto pound. Walton took issue with the email&rsquo;s claim that those impound lots were full after nine days. &quot;It never reached even close to capacity after this was implemented,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd has the Dallas ordinance disproportionately affected residents who are in the country illegally?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalton told us there&rsquo;s no way to prove the figure the email offers because police officers don&rsquo;t usually ask whether individuals are citizens in these situations. &quot;We (also) do not check citizenship or the status of immigration when people come to claim their car,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&rsquo;t know where that (percentage) came from.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext, we explored another angle that might help independently evaluate the email: &nbsp;If illegal immigrants cannot obtain auto insurance, then perhaps they couldn&rsquo;t be recovering their cars. Greeley of the TDI advised, though, that Texas residents do not have to show they are legally in the country before purchasing vehicle insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, we ran the chain email by Steve Blow, a news columnist for the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> who has written about the city&rsquo;s impoundment of vehicles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his opinion, Blow said, the email has a grain of truth and a lot of fiction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I know the line about the impound lot filling up is wrong,&quot; Blow said in an email. &quot;That was one of the predictions that never happened. I have no idea where the 80 percent illegals figure comes from. Cops don&rsquo;t inquire about citizenship. And I have heard nothing about accident rates plunging 47 percent. If that were true, I think police officials would have been eager to make that known.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDallas has an ordinance that has led to cars getting impounded. Yet we found no evidence supporting the email&rsquo;s linchpin claim that about 80 percent of the cars initially impounded belonged to illegal residents. There&rsquo;s not even a factual way to reach that figure; Dallas authorities don&rsquo;t usually check the legal residency status of motorists.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this chain email False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-02-24T13:58:00.329782", "ruling_date": "2012-02-28T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Chain email says Dallas ordinance led to towing of many cars belonging to illegal U.S. residents", "ruling_headline_slug": "chain-email-says-dallas-ordinance-led-towing-many-", "ruling_link_text": "Nobody could know", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCity of Dallas ordinance, <a href=\"http://www.dallascityhall.com/police/pdfs/towing_ordinance.pdf\">ordinance no. 27189</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Dallas Morning News</em>, news article, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1Q-oP_SKSbuTU-U7vDRu0QkTnBSCMnA1j-VgET-4egy4\">Uninsured drivers face new law</a>, Dec. 30, 2008<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Mitchell Rasansky, former Dallas City Council member, Feb. 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interviews, Scott Walton, lieutenant of police, media relations unit, Dallas Police Department, February 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Veneza Aguinaga, public information officer, Austin Police Department, Feb. 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, John Greeley, public information officer, Texas Department of Insurance, Feb. 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail exchange, Steve Blow, news columnist at <em>The Dallas Morning News</em>, Feb. 23, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Fake_news", "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "", "false_count": 44, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "", "id": 27, "last_name": "Chain email", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "chain-email", "pants_count": 106, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-emailer.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/27/", "total_count": 180, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tA Dallas proof-of-insurance ordinance resulted in area tow lots mostly filling with the cars of illegal residents.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a chain email.", "statement_date": "2012-01-31", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>Amnesty,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">self-deportation</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/donald-trump-mexico-immigration-presidential-campaign\">wall</a>.
