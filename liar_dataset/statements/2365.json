Republican state Sen. Jon Husted, of the Dayton area, is O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s opponent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s factually correct to say that Ken Blackwell had at least 18 lawsuits that were even carried over that Jennifer Brunner inherited when she came into the office as a result of his mismanagement of the 2004 election,&quot; O&rsquo;Shaughnessy said in an Aug. 16 interview with WPKO/WBLL in Bellefontaine, a city in west-central Ohio, after a speech to local Democrats.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrunner, a Democrat, was elected in November 2006 to succeed Blackwell after he lost a gubernatorial bid that year. O&rsquo;Shaughnessy told the radio station that, if elected, she would maintain the stability Brunner brought to the office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tO&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s comments put her on a long list of Democrats to criticize Blackwell. We wanted to check out her claim and asked her campaign for information about the lawsuits. A spokeswoman pointed to a letter Brunner wrote The Columbus Dispatch and a separate news story that appeared in The Daily Record, of Wooster.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a letter to the Dispatch published Feb. 18, 2007, Brunner said 21 lawsuits were pending when she took office. She did not say how many were related to the 2004 presidential election. The Daily Record story, published April 5, 2007, also said 21 lawsuits were pending when Brunner took office. The story made no mention of the 2004 presidential election.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe portion of O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s statement that said Brunner inherited &quot;at least 18 lawsuits&quot; seemed solid. But there was no proof, within the evidence O&rsquo;Shaughnessy&rsquo;s office provided -- that those lawsuits were related to the 2004 presidential election.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked with Brunner&rsquo;s office, which provided a comprehensive list of all cases that Brunner inherited from Blackwell. It is not specific to the 2004 presidential election, Brunner spokesman Patrick Gallaway said. The list, last updated in January, shows Brunner inherited 18 cases when she took office, including one settled during Blackwell&rsquo;s term with unpaid fees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCourt documents showed 10 of the 18 cases are related to Blackwell&rsquo;s administration of the 2004 presidential election. The others dealt with a myriad of issues, including campaign finance law and the use of electronic voting machines.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo their credit, the O&rsquo;Shaughnessy campaign acknowledged she was incorrect after we shared the records from Brunner&rsquo;s office with them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;She misspoke about the ones that relate to 2004,&quot; spokeswoman Heidi Hubmann said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tO&rsquo;Shaughnessy clearly jumped to an inaccurate conclusion about Blackwell&rsquo;s job performance in the radio interview. Her sources of information, two newspaper articles from 2007, do not support the meat of her claim &ndash; that Blackwell&rsquo;s mismanagement of the 2004 election led to at least 18 lawsuits that landed in Brunner&rsquo;s lap. Brunner&rsquo;s records show that&rsquo;s not true.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/09/maryellen_oshaughnessy_oversta.html\" target=\"blank\">Comment on this item</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-09T19:33:49.643752", "ruling_date": "2010-09-10T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Maryellen O\u2019Shaughnessy overstates number of lawsuits inherited from Ken Blackwell over 2004 presidential election", "ruling_headline_slug": "maryellen-oshaughnessy-overstates-number-lawsuits-", "ruling_link_text": "Factually incorrect is more like it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWPKO/WBLL <a href=\"http://www.peakofohio.com/uploads/file/Maryellen%20O'Shaughnessy%20visits%20Logan%20County%208-16-10.mp3\" target=\"blank\">radio interview</a> with O&rsquo;Shaughnessy<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecretary of State Jennifer Brunner, <a href=\"http://blog.cleveland.com/pdextra/2010/09/secretary_of_states_office_lis.html\" target=\"blank\">office records showing lawsuits inherited</a> from Ken Blackwell<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with O&rsquo;Shaughnessy spokeswoman Heidi Hubmann<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Brunner spokesman Patrick Gallaway<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrunner&rsquo;s letter to The Columbus Dispatch, Feb. 18, 2007<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe (Wooster) Daily Record, &quot;Secretary of State requests office expense funds,&quot; April 5, 2007</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Franklin County clerk of courts", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Maryellen", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 654, "last_name": "O'Shaughnessy", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "maryellen-oshaughnessy", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifactohio-maryellen-oshaughnessy.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/654/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.maryellenforohio.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s factually correct to say&quot; that Jennifer Brunner inherited at least 18 lawsuits when she came into the office that were a result of Ken Blackwell&rsquo;s &quot;mismanagement of the 2004 election.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a radio interview", "statement_date": "2010-08-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 131, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/131/", "subject": "Government Efficiency", "subject_slug": "government-efficiency", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
