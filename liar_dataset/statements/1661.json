Silvestre Reyes refers  to a dramatic blast from the past.</p>\r\n<p>The El Paso Democrat states in  a March 11 e-mail: &ldquo;An audit of the last census found that over 370,000  people living in Texas were not counted, and our state lost an  estimated $1 billion in federal funds as a result.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Goodness. (And where <em>did</em> that census form disappear to?)</p>\r\n<p>Does Reyes get his big  numbers right? And if there was an undercount, did it cause Texas to  miss out on a big chunk of federal aid?</p>\r\n<p>For starters, we found  no such audit, and Reyes&rsquo; office didn&rsquo;t provide back-up for his  statement. However, a 2001 PriceWaterhouseCoopers study prepared for the  U.S. Census Bureau Monitoring Board, an entity that no longer exists,  stated that nationally, the 2000 census failed to count some 3.3 million  residents, including 373,567 Texas residents.</p>\r\n<p>The undercount  figures were attributed to the Census Bureau and Eugene Ericksen, a  Temple University sociologist.</p>\r\n<p>Some perspective: Reyes&rsquo; recent e-mail harkens to concerns aired in  2000, especially by Democrats, that without an adjustment the census  would fail to account for many residents, mainly racial minorities and  renters. The bureau did not adjust its count of the nation&rsquo;s population.</p>\r\n<p>The  2001 report said the undercount could result in a federal funding loss  of $4 billion across 31 states (including Texas) and the District of  Columbia. It raised the prospect of California and Texas losing the  most, $1.5 billion and $1 billion, respectively, from fiscal 2002 to  2012.</p>\r\n<p>A press release accompanying the report included this  warning from Peter Merrill of PricewaterhouseCoopers' National Economic  Consulting group: &ldquo;Inaccuracies in the census can cause federal funds to  be distributed in a way that is not fully consistent with congressional  intent. The census undercount not only misallocates funds among  jurisdictions, it also causes a net loss to the states of funds from  federal entitlement programs. Compounding the problem, many state-funded  grant programs to localities also rely on census counts.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Reyes  isn't alone in using figures from the 2001 report to argue the  importance of participation in the 2010 census. Since last summer, Texas  newspapers including the Austin American-Statesman, Dallas Morning  News, Fort Worth Star-Telegram and San Antonio Express-News have  mentioned figures<strong> </strong>from the report.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Does the report still  hold water?</p>\r\n<p>Our finding: Like a sunk boat.</p>\r\n<p>About two  months after the PriceWaterhouseCoopers report came out, the Census  Bureau said it would reassess how accurately it had counted the nation's  residents in 2000. And in 2003, the bureau announced new estimates for  what the 2000 counts for each state should have been.</p>\r\n<p>And there  was another twist: Instead of undercounting the nation's population, the  bureau concluded it had over-counted by about 1.3 million people.</p>\r\n<p>David  Whitford, chief of the bureau&rsquo;s Decennial Statistical Studies Division,  told us that the bureau ultimately realized that undercounts nationally  were more than offset by double-counting of many individuals and other  errors. One example: counting students away at college while also  recording them as part of their parents' household back home.</p>\r\n<p>Some  population groups were affected more than others. The bureau said it  had overcounted whites, Asians, American Indians on reservations and  young children, the Associated Press reported, while many blacks and  Hispanics were missed.</p>\r\n<p>There was still a small net undercount (by 10,245 people, or .05 percent) in  Texas, the bureau said. The census count of Texans should have been  20,862,065, the bureau estimated.</p>\r\n<p>Where  does this leave the PriceWaterhouseCoopers study? Professor Ericksen  told us that by repudiating its initial undercount estimates, the bureau  effectively invalidated both the population figures and federal aid  estimates.</p>\r\n<p>And Merrill of  PriceWaterhouseCoopers cautioned against using its 2001 report for  another reason: \"It is certainly out of date... Our firm is not telling  anyone that the analysis done in 2001 is relevant for today.\"</p>\r\n<p>Vincent  Perez, Reyes' press secretary, said he's been unable to get the Census  Bureau to confirm that it backed off the estimate that more than 370,000  Texas residents weren't counted in the 2000 census.</p>\r\n<p>How does  Rep. Reyes&rsquo; statement stand up?</p>\r\n<p>Reyes incorrectly refers to the  consultant&rsquo;s projections as an audit of the census; it was a report.</p>\r\n<p>More  importantly, Reyes relies -- as have other entities -- on an outdated  report based on numbers the Census Bureau has said were flawed. The  bureau long ago yanked the statistical rug out from under the claim that  more than 370,000 Texas residents were not counted and that Texas stood  to miss out on $1 billion in aid as a result.</p>\r\n<p>This isn't a close  call. We rate Reyes' statement as Pants on Fire.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-04-06T16:26:40.421527", "ruling_date": "2010-04-06T16:45:24", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
