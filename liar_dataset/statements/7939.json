A day later, the GOP-majority House advanced the measure to the Senate for possible action before a 30-day special session was to end June 25.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLaubenberg, responding to questions from Democratic Reps. Joseph Moody of El Paso and Dawnna Dukes of Austin, framed her refusal to accept Thompson&rsquo;s amendment by implying that rape kits used in hospitals can prevent unwanted pregnancy. Laubenberg said that currently, in &quot;the emergency rooms they have what&rsquo;s called rape kits, that the woman can get cleaned out, basically like a D and C&quot; -- dilation and curettage surgery, often performed after miscarriages.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe looked into whether the representative was correct that a rape kit is akin to dilation and curettage surgery, ultimately finding no common ground or any factual basis for this claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDilation and curettage, according to a<a href=\"http://www.acog.org/%7E/media/For%20Patients/faq062.pdf?dmc=1&amp;ts=20130624T1432538307\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4dbde81a-77e2-42c0-5cb1-97257f69717a\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>fact sheet</u></a> on the website of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, is a surgical procedure that removes tissue from the lining of the uterus; it is often performed after a miscarriage. A woman&rsquo;s cervix is dilated, or widened, to permit the use of instruments such as a curette, a thin metal tool with a scoop or ring on one end that is used to scrape the interior of the uterus.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe doctors&rsquo; group put us in touch with Dr. Bonnie Dattel, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Eastern Virginia Medical School, who said by phone that a D&amp;C is sometimes performed after a miscarriage to remove material left from the pregnancy that could cause infection or excessive bleeding if left in place.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn contrast, a rape kit typically consists of tools, storage containers and paperwork related to collecting evidence in the first days after a possible sexual assault, according to Texas experts we reached and <u><a href=\"http://www.rainn.org/get-information/sexual-assault-recovery/rape-kit\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4dbde81a-77e2-8392-ba21-07cab31ac0dc\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">information posted online</a></u> by the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, <u><a href=\"http://www.rainn.org/about-rainn\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4dbde81a-77e2-e6c9-c9d9-395fdf898702\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">which calls itself</a></u> the nation&#39;s largest anti-sexual violence organization.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe network says: &quot;Following a sexual assault, the victim has the option to go to the hospital to have a forensic examination by a trained professional. During a forensic medical exam, a sexual assault evidence collection kit may or may not be used. The evidence kit affords the opportunity to collect any DNA that may have been left by the suspect.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe network&rsquo;s web page makes no mention of surgical procedures, instead saying a kit may contain instructions, bags and sheets for evidence collection, swabs, a comb, envelopes, blood collection devices and documentation forms.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn exam using the kit &quot;will most likely begin with the examiner obtaining a complete and thorough medical history from the victim. The medical forensic exam also involves a head-to-toe physical examination, which includes the genital area,&quot; the network says. The exam may also involve the collection of blood, urine, hair and other body secretion samples; photo documentation; the collection of the victim&rsquo;s clothing, especially undergarments; and the collection of any possible physical evidence that may have transferred onto the victim from the rape scene, the network says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Once the examination is completed and all specimens are collected,&quot; the network says, &quot;they are carefully packaged and stored to assure that they are not contaminated.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn interviews, representatives of the <u><a href=\"http://www.taasa.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Texas Association Against Sexual Assault</a></u>, which says it&rsquo;s committed to ending sexual violence in Texas, and the Collin County-based <u><a href=\"http://www.theturningpoint.org/\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-4dbde81a-77e3-95cb-0d88-115a2577f837\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Turning Point Rape Crisis Center</a></u>, which counsels rape survivors, elaborated on what a rape kit is and isn&rsquo;t.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTAASA spokesman Rick Gipprich said by telephone that certified sexual assault nurse examiners typically use the kits to gather information and collect relevant samples.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSometimes a pregnancy test is administered, Gipprich said, but that is solely to see if a survivor might have been pregnant before the assault. Also, he said, the pregnancy test is not part of the kit. In addition, Gipprich said, a survivor may be offered high-dose antibiotics to ward off sexually transmitted diseases as well as a &quot;morning after&quot; pill to prevent impregnation, though such drugs and those offers are not part of the kit, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJennifer Spugnardi, director of the Turning Point center, said by telephone that a rape kit is &quot;really papers and envelopes,&quot; reflecting the nurse examiner&rsquo;s responsibility to document an incident. Spugnardi said the kits are sometimes called &quot;Sirchie kits,&quot; referring to a <u><a href=\"http://www.sirchie.com/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">forensics supplies company</a></u> that sells the kits. Online, we found a photo of a $15 Sirchie kit designed to meet criteria for a kit as spelled out in a <u><a href=\"https://www.oag.state.tx.us/AG_Publications/pdfs/evidence_collection.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">publication</a></u> from the Texas attorney general&rsquo;s office. Sirchie <u><a href=\"http://store.sirchie.com/Southwestern-Sexual-Assault-Evidence-Collection-Kit-P1926C630.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">describes</a></u> the kit as containing legal and medical forms, oral swabs and hair combs and containers to separately hold clothing or biological samples.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLike Gipprich, Spugnardi said any prescribed medicines are not part of a rape kit. She also pointed out that a kit can be used for a female or male victim. Regardless, she said, a kit is not equivalent to the D and C surgery or related to it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSpugnardi called the legislator&rsquo;s statement &quot;a very poor choice of words.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy email and telephone, we asked Laubenberg how she reached her conclusion. She didn&rsquo;t immediately respond. After this article posted, however, Laubenberg said by telephone that she knows a rape kit does not include the D and C procedure and that a kit does not cause abortions. In the floor debate, Laubenberg said, she also was trying to say that a rape survivor who goes to a hospital might be offered the morning-after pill to ward off pregnancy, though she said that she is aware that the pill is not part of a rape kit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the debate, Laubenberg said, her point may have been muddled. &quot;You&rsquo;re trying to get your thoughts out as fast as you can,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLaubenberg said a rape kit is equivalent to dilation and curettage surgery.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA rape kit consists of items a medical specialist employs to gather evidence related to a possible sexual assault. It is not the same as the D and C procedure, which removes the lining of the uterus.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe find this unsupported claim incorrect and ridiculous.
