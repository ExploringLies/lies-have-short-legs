Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future,&quot; Obama said during the Oct. 3, 2012, debate at the University of Denver. &quot;And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It&#39;s called premium support, but it&#39;s understood to be a voucher program.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the past, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/16/barack-obama/does-paul-ryan-want-turn-medicare-voucher-program/\">PolitiFact </a>has found Obama&rsquo;s &quot;voucher&quot; characterization reasonable, though as Obama noted, Republicans prefer &quot;premium support.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMerriam-Webster <a href=\"http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/voucher\">defines a voucher </a>as &quot;a written affidavit or authorization &hellip; a form or check indicating a credit against future purchases or expenditures; a coupon issued by government to a parent or guardian to be used to fund a child&#39;s education in either a public or private school.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe plan pushed by Romney&rsquo;s running mate, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, isn&rsquo;t exactly a coupon, but it&rsquo;s not so far off.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats have attacked Ryan&rsquo;s Medicare reform ideas since he presented his first version in early 2011. Ryan has since tweaked his ideas, and Romney indicated in a summer <a href=\"http://www.wbay.com/story/19290298/2012/08/15/mitt-romney-talks-medicare-in-exclusive-interview-with-action-2-news\">interview </a>that he agrees with Ryan&rsquo;s most recent plan, which Ryan presented as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the current system, the federal government pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services. That would end under the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan. Instead, beneficiaries would have the choice of receiving a fixed subsidy from the federal government that could go toward a private insurance plan or a plan similar to traditional Medicare. We should note the plan would only apply to people who are under 55 today, not current seniors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe private plans would comply with standards set by the federal government. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based in part on the second least-expensive plan available on the health insurance exchange.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe don&rsquo;t know with certainty whether the premium subsidy would be able to cover the same set of benefits as traditional Medicare, or how much it would add to out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, because the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office hasn&rsquo;t released a detailed analysis, as it did for an earlier version of Ryan&rsquo;s proposal when he provided the office with more substantial details.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome experts in health policy <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/16/barack-obama/does-paul-ryan-want-turn-medicare-voucher-program/\">say there are marked differences </a>between the terms &quot;voucher&quot; and &quot;premium support.&quot; While there are technical differences that may matter to health-policy professionals, these are not the type of differences that most beneficiaries would see as significant. In recent years, the definitions of &quot;premium support&quot; and &quot;vouchers&quot; have become almost indistinguishable.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGenerally, we think &quot;voucher program&quot; is a fair way of describing to voters the vision for Medicare under a Romney-Ryan administration. We rate Obama&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-03T22:56:15.177583", "ruling_date": "2012-10-03T23:05:24", "ruling_headline": "Obama says Romney wants to turn Medicare into a voucher program", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-says-romney-wants-turn-medicare-voucher-prog", "ruling_link_text": "A familiar, pretty accurate refrain", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBarack Obama, remarks during the first presidential debate, Oct. 3, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/16/barack-obama/does-paul-ryan-want-turn-medicare-voucher-program/\">Do Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to turn Medicare into a voucher program</a>?,&quot; Aug. 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/aug/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-ryan-romney-plan-will-end-medica/\">Obama radio ad says Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher</a>,&quot; Aug. 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMitt Romney <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/medicare\">Medicare plan website</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/08/15/remarks-president-and-first-lady-campaign-event-davenport-iowa\">remarks by the President and First Lady at a campaign event in Davenport, Iowa</a>, Aug. 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDavid Axelrod, <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1208/12/sotu.01.html\">interview</a>on CNN&rsquo;s State of the Union, Aug. 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDavid Axelrod, email to supporters, Aug. 11, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWBAY ABC-TV-2 (Green Bay, Wis.), &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wbay.com/story/19290298/2012/08/15/mitt-romney-talks-medicare-in-exclusive-interview-with-action-2-news\">Mitt Romney Talks Medicare in Exclusive Interview with Action 2 News</a>,&quot; Aug. 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrookings Institution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2011/12/16-premium-support-primer\">Premium Support: A Primer</a>,&quot; Dec. 16, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, &quot;Building a Better Medicare for Today and Tomorrow&quot; (<a href=\"http://rs9.loc.gov/medicare/bbmtt31599.html\">final version</a>), March 16, 1999<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, <a href=\"http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12128/04-05-ryan_letter.pdf\">analysis</a>of original Ryan plan, April 5, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/03-20-Ryan_Specified_Paths_2.pdf\">The Long-Term Budgetary Impact of Paths for Federal Revenues and Spending Specified by Chairman Ryan</a>,&quot; March 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaiser Family Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/8284.pdf\">Comparison of Medicare Premium Support Proposals</a>,&quot; accessed Aug. 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFiscal Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Blogs/Gooz-News/2012/04/27/What-to-Call-Ryans-Private-Medicare-Plan.aspx#page1\">What to Call Ryan&#39;s Private Medicare Plan</a>,&quot; April 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFiscal Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2010/11/18/Rivlin-Domenici-Put-Medicare-on-a-Weight-Loss-Diet.aspx#page1\">Rivlin-Domenici Put Medicare on a Weight Loss Diet</a>,&quot; Nov. 18, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHouse Ways and Means Committee, hearing on Medicare premium support proposals, April 27, 2012 (accessed via Nexis)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHeritage Foundation, &quot;Medicare Reform Stage 2: Moving to a Premium Support System&quot; (news release), Nov. 28, 2011 (accessed via Nexis)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUrban Institute, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.urban.org/uploadedpdf/309232_medicare_comp.pdf\">Can Competition Improve Medicare?
