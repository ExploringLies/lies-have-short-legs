In 2010, Kingston told the political website <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1210/46172.html#ixzz37B8GIdzJ\">Politico</a> that the definition of earmarks, if not the ban, needed revie<u>w.</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let&rsquo;s look at transportation,&quot; he said. &quot;How do you handle that without earmarks, since that&rsquo;s a heavily earmarked bill?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this month, Kingston &nbsp;defended his earmarks to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as support for military and defense projects in a state with eight military installations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His spokesman, Chris Crawford, called the accusation that Kingston supported thousands of earmarks false on its face &ndash; given the hundreds specifically tied to Kingston&rsquo;s name. He also said it was a &quot;blatant fabrication&quot; trying to link Kingston to other lawmakers&rsquo; projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Kingston may have a point, said Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. The nonpartisan organization opposes earmarks because the system rewards political power over project merit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Ellis said Kingston, or any lawmaker of his tenure, would have voted for thousands of earmarks simply by voting to fund the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, lawmakers would chop spending, say for the Department of Defense, into dozens of earmarks. In other cases, earmarks were added to programs, driving up the overall cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the final vote reflects support for an overall defense budget bill, not the pet projects inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the most die-hard opponent of pork would have cast votes that included money for state or local projects such as paving roads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s not like he voted for these (earmarks) separately,&quot; Ellis said. &quot;They were stuffed into bills.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, did Kingston vote on thousands of earmarks? In a word, yes. But so does any other lawmaker who votes for major legislation such as transportation funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perdue would have been on firmer ground if he had attributed to Kingston the specific earmarks for his district.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Were the earmarks wasteful as the statement claims? That&rsquo;s far trickier to prove.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those votes were taken as part of a central function of Congress, to vote on the budget. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of truth in Perdue&rsquo;s claim, but just a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-07-14T15:18:37.392330", "ruling_date": "2014-07-15T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Perdue's earmark claim overstated", "ruling_headline_slug": "perdues-earmark-claim-overstated", "ruling_link_text": "\"Thousands of earmarks\" are part of the budget", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>David Perdue ad, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi3IB_G0qBc\"><strong>Spender</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsive Politics earmarks<a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/earmarks/index.php?cycle=2007&amp;type=S\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <strong><u>database</u></strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taxpayers for Common Sense earmarks<strong><a href=\"http://www.taxpayer.net/library/article/earmark-and-appropriations-data\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>database</u></a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr3\"><strong>Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081000223.html\"><strong>Road Bill Reflects The Power of Pork</strong></a>,&quot; Aug. 11, 2005</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Final <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll065.xml\"><strong>vote</strong></a> results, Transportation Equity Act</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1210/46172.html#ixzz37B8GIdzJ\"><strong>GOP Gets Queasy Over Earmark Ban</strong></a>,&quot; Dec. 9, 1010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Derrick Dickey, spokesman for David Perdue, July 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Chris Crawford, spokesman for Jack Kingston July 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Steve Ellis, vice president, Taxpayers for Common Sense, July 10, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "U.S. Senate candidate", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "David", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 2602, "last_name": "Perdue", "mostly_true_count": 8, "name_slug": "david-perdue", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/David_Perdue.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2602/", "total_count": 20, "true_count": 0, "website": "https://perduesenate.com/"}, "statement": "<p>U.S. Senate candidate Jack Kingston &quot;spent our tax dollars on thousands of wasteful earmarks.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an ad", "statement_date": "2014-06-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Jack", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 909, "last_name": "Kingston", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "jack-kingston", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Jack_Kingston.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/909/", "total_count": 13, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": ""}
