She became CEO of Points of Light Foundation, the service-oriented organization inspired by President George H.W. Bush, in 2007. Nunn is on leave while campaigning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Spending Action Fund, a political action committee founded by Joe Ricketts, former CEO of TD Ameritrade, has spent more than $1 million on Nunn attack ads since April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Spending president Brian Baker told PolitiFact Georgia last month that the group opposed two candidates this year, Nunn and Republican U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey. Both jumped in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Georgia, but Gingrey was knocked out in the crowded GOP primary that Perdue ultimately won.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July, PolitiFact Georgia rated as Mostly True an Ending Spending ad claim that Nunn earned as much as $300,000 from Points of Light after the non-profit had laid of 90 workers (due to a merger). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contest between Nunn, daughter of retired U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, and Perdue, cousin of former Gov. Sonny Perdue, is one of the most closely watched of this year&rsquo;s elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prospect of Democrats winning a Senate seat in Republican-controlled Georgia is energizing for Nunn and her party. They want to reclaim a Georgia Senate seat and keep control of the Senate chamber for the last two years of President Barack Obama&rsquo;s term. Republicans need six seats to claim the Senate majority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For our fact-check of the newest ad from Ending Spending, we contacted Baker, asking for evidence to back up the ad&rsquo;s claims. He sent us a document based largely on the Nunn campaign&rsquo;s 144-page internal memo and a story in National Review, the conservative magazine that broke the story of the leaked memo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 28th, National Review Online reported that Points of Light had made grants totalling more than $33,000 to Islamic Relief USA, one of a global network of charities that&rsquo;s under the umbrella of Islamic Relief Worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June, Israel&rsquo;s defense minister labeled Islamic Relief Worldwide an &quot;unauthorised association&quot; and has prevented the group from operating in Israel and the West Bank, citing its links to the Palestinian and U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a web posting, officials with Islamic Relief Worldwide said the organization &quot;is extremely surprised and concerned by this and categorically denies any links with Hamas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stefanie Weiss, Points of Light&rsquo;s &nbsp;communications director, told us the nonprofit &quot;has never had any dealings with or given any grants to Hamas or any known terrorist group.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 2003 to 2011, MissionFish was a Points of Light business unit that allowed eBay sellers and buyers to direct all or part of the proceeds from a transaction to their favorite charity, Weiss said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EBay users could donate to any of 20,000 organizations, all of which were registered 501(c)(3) nonprofits or the overseas equivalent, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These nonprofits were vetted regularly to ensure tax-exempt status, good standing with the IRS, and exclusion from terrorist watch lists,&quot; Weiss said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Islamic Relief USA was one of them and &quot;remains an eBay Giving Works-approved charity,&quot; she said. (Points of Light sold MissionFish to eBay in 2011.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Points of Lights&rsquo; IRS 990s show Islamic Relief USA, which describes itself as an independent affiliate of Islamic Relief Worldwide,<em> </em>received about $13,500 in contributions from eBay buyers and sellers in 2006, 2007 and 2010. National Review has corrected its story to show that the $33,000 figure was in error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nathan Click, spokesman for the Nunn campaign, called the ad a &quot;false and ridiculous attack against Points of Light -- an organization founded by President George H.W. Bush that mobilizes million of volunteers each year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said this kind of attack &quot;is exactly what Georgians are ready to change about our political process.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just the mention of the word Islamic can ignite strong emotions in some people. And those working to block Nunn&rsquo;s candidacy clearly know that and hope the ad will work in their favor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our research showed the group that Points of Light dealt with -- Islamic Relief USA -- is an approved charity and not on the U.S.&rsquo;s terrorist watch list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the record of its umbrella organization, Islamic Relief Worldwide, is not clear. Leaders of IRW deny any connection to Hamas. But a top Israeli official in June banned Islamic Relief Worldwide from working in the country, saying terrorist connections exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad says Nunn&#39;s foundation &quot;directed money.&quot; But Points of Light&nbsp; instead allowed eBay buyers and sellers to choose whether to take part in the program and then designate any one of 20,000 charities, including Islamic Relief USA, to get donated funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Donors&nbsp; gave to an entity that is not on the U.S. government&rsquo;s terrorist watch list. These type of donations started before Nunn arrived at Points of Light, and the nonprofit sold MissionFish, three years before the Israel government banned the umbrella group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Spending Action makes a very specific claim based more on innuendo than evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-07T16:48:57.065064", "ruling_date": "2014-08-08T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Attack ad misfires on nonprofit", "ruling_headline_slug": "attack-ad-misfires-nonprofits-connection-terrorism", "ruling_link_text": "PAC swings, misses", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The <a href=\"http://endingspendingfund.com/\">ad </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email with Brian Baker, president, Ending Spending</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone and email interviews with Stefanie Weiss, chief communications and marketing officer, Points of Light, Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview and email with Nathan Click, spokesman for Michelle Nunn campaign</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MissionFish <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MissionFish\">background</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>More on <a href=\"https://www.paypalgivingfund.org/index.html\">MissionFish</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Points of Light, IRS Form 990 for <a href=\"http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990_pdf_archive/650/650206641/650206641_200609_990.pdf\">2006</a><br />\r\nU.S. Department of <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/terrorist-illicit-finance/Pages/protecting-fto.aspx\">Treasury</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statement from Islamic Relief <a href=\"http://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/news/statement-by-islamic-relief-on-operations-in-the-palestinian-territories/\">organization </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Israel bans Islamic Relief Worldwide from West Bank due to Hamas ties,&quot; Jewish <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Operation-Brothers-Keeper/Israel-bans-Islamic-Relief-Worldwide-from-West-Bank-due-to-Hamas-ties-359934\">Times</a>, June 19, 2014<a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Operation-Brothers-Keeper/Israel-bans-Islamic-Relief-Worldwide-from-West-Bank-due-to-Hamas-ties-359934\"> </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. list of terrorist <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm\">groups</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Points of light sells MissionFish to eBay,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Points+of+light+sells+MissionFish+to+eBay.-a0257674883\">The</a> Non-Profit Times, May 15, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;MissionFish is now the PayPal <a href=\"https://www.paypalgivingfund.org/whats-new/2013/us_missionfish-becomes-paypal-giving-fund.html\">Giving</a> Fund,&quot; Jan. 14, 2013,<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Paypal Giving Fund Website and option of giving to Islamic Relief USA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://givingworks.ebay.com/charity-auctions/charity/islamic-relief/13961/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>http://givingworks.ebay.com/charity-auctions/charity/islamic-relief/13961/</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 2780, "last_name": "Ending Spending Action Fund", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "ending-spending-action-fund", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 6, "party": "Independent", "party_slug": "independent", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/6/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PolitiFact_silhouette_15.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2780/", "total_count": 6, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://endingspendingfund.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Michelle Nunn&rsquo;s &quot;foundation directed grants to an Islamic group tied to radical terrorists.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "television attack ad", "statement_date": "2014-08-04", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 37, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/37/", "subject": "Terrorism", "subject_slug": "terrorism", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
