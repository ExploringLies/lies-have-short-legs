Klenet represents state groups such as the Florida Association of Mortgage Brokers, but also companies such as Match.com and Election Systems &amp; Software.\n</p>\n<p>\n And Obama still accepts tens of thousands of dollars from people who work for Washington firms that do substantial lobbying. Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is an Obama contributor who isn't a registered lobbyist, but works as a consultant for Alston & Bird, a lobbying firm in Washington.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Center for Responsive Politics found that Obama accepted $55,019 from employees at lobbying firms, and much more from companies that are not classified as lobbying firms but have lobbying divisions.\n</p>\n<p>\n So we give Obama's statement a Half-True on the Truth-O-Meter.  While Obama can accurately say that he does not accept money from federally registered lobbyists, he still accepts thousands from people in the influence industry.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:39.695328", "ruling_date": "2007-08-21T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "If it quacks like a lobbyist, it's a lobbyist", "ruling_headline_slug": "if-it-quacks-like-a-lobbyist-its-a-lobbyist", "ruling_link_text": "If it quacks like a lobbyist, it's a lobbyist", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Interviews: Anthony Corrado, Colby College, Massie Ritsch, Center for Responsive Politics, Thomas Mann (via e-mail), Brookings Institution, Craig Holman, Public Citizen\n<p>\n Chicago Sun-Times Editorial, March 5, 2003\n</p>\n<p>\n Los Angeles Times, April 22, 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n Los Angeles Times, August 4, 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n The Hill,\n <a href=\"http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/obamas-k-street-project-2007-03-28.html\">\n  Obama's K Street Project, March 28, 2007\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Chicago Sun-Times Editorial, January 12, 2004\n</p>\n<p>\n Washington Post Editorial, January 20, 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n Washington Post, April 15, 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n New York Times, July 30, 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/us/politics/07demsforum.html\">\n  Transcript of AFL-CIO Forum\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n St. Petersburg Times,\n <a href=\"http://www.sptimes.com/2007/08/16/Worldandnation/Obama_follows_fine_li.shtml\">\n  Obama follow fine line, August 16, 2007\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n Associated Press, August 17, 2007\n <a href=\"http://news.bostonherald.com/politics/view.bg?articleid=1017752\">\n  Obama says he swims in 'muddy waters' polluting Washington, pledges cleanup\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/\">\n  Center for Responsive Politics\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Obama campaign Web site,\n <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/2007/07/30/obama_says_that_as_president_h.php\">\n  Obama Says that as President, He'll Continue Life-Long Commitment to Ethics Reform\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Campaign Finance Institute,\n <a href=\"http://www.cfinst.org/pr/prRelease.aspx?ReleaseID=136\">\n  Big, $1,000+ Donations Supply 79% of Presidential Candidates' Early Money\n </a>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "\"He's leading by example, refusing contributions from PACs and Washington lobbyists.\"", "statement_context": "a TV ad.", "statement_date": "2007-08-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 35, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/35/", "subject": "Ethics", "subject_slug": "ethics", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
