Let&rsquo;s take a closer look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The bill</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin introduced <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr6109/text\">House Resolution 6109</a>, the Health Data Collection Improvement Act, in September in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill got little news coverage at the time, although a reader of the Eau Claire<em> Leader-Telegram</em> newspaper raised it in an <a href=\"http://www.leadertelegram.com/news/daily_updates/article_7779f14a-0775-57ec-a127-2bd55b1ccdfd.html\">online discussion</a> after the first Thompson-Baldwin Senate debate in September 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaldwin explained the reason for her bill in a statement when the bill was introduced, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonblade.com/2010/09/14/baldwin-introduces-lgbt-health-care-data-bill/\">according</a> to <em>Washington Blade</em>, a gay news publication:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Currently, the federal government does not collect any information about the health and well-being of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Americans. Consequently, our knowledge of the health of the LGBT community is drastically insufficient and our current health care system fails LGBT individuals on many levels.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill was sent to the Health Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The subcommittee <a href=\"http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?q=markup/health-subcommittee-markup-0\">approved</a> an <a href=\"http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/documents/20100916/health/h6109r_01_xml.pdf\">amendment</a> by Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., prohibiting the collection of sexual orientation and gender identity from minors without the consent of a parent or guardian.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe subcommittee then <a href=\"http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/documents/20100916/health/hr6109_rollcall.pdf\">voted</a>, 12-10, to send the amended bill to the full committee, where it died.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat would it have done?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to a <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr6109\">summary</a> by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, Baldwin&rsquo;s measure would have required the health and human services secretary &quot;to ensure that each HHS health service program or HHS health survey provides, to the extent the secretary determines appropriate and practicable, for the voluntary collection of data on the sexual orientation and gender identity of individuals who apply for or receive health services through such program, or who respond to such survey.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a mouthful.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo break it down:<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe bill would have required the collection of data from individuals on their sexual orientation and gender identity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIt would have been left to the U.S. health and human services secretary how to collect the data.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tPatient participation would have been voluntary.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe discussed the bill with health policy experts from two Washington, D.C. research organizations: <a href=\"http://www.americanprogress.org/about/staff/baker-kellan/bio/\">Kellan Baker</a> of the liberal Center for American Progress, and <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/h/edmund-haislmaier\">Edmund Haislmaier</a> of the conservative Heritage Foundation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey agreed that since Baldwin&rsquo;s bill gave discretion to the health and human services secretary, it&rsquo;s possible that doctors and other health care workers in certain clinics or other settings could have been required to ask patients about their sexual orientation and gender identity -- although that could have been through routine intake questionnaires rather than being asked to face to face.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe experts also agreed that Baldwin&rsquo;s bill would not have required doctors or other health care workers to ask patients about sexual orientation. Again, it would have been left to the HHS secretary to decide how to collect the data, and that might have been largely done through means such as anonymous telephone surveys that the agency already does.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGrothman himself agreed, when we asked about his claim, that while the bill was written to be applied broadly, it would have been up to HHS to write regulations on how to collect the data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA final note:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile Baldwin&rsquo;s bill did not become law, the federal government is moving to collect such data in connection with President Barack Obama&rsquo;s Affordable Care Act, known to critics as &quot;Obamacare.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn June 2011, the Health and Human Services Department <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/06/20110629a.html\">announced</a> it would add questions on sexual orientation to its national data collection efforts <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/2011/06/lgbt06292011a.html\">by 2013</a>. The department also announced it would begin a process to collect information on gender identity.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBaker, of the Center for American Progress, said HHS is working on adding sexual orientation to its National Health Interview Survey, which is done randomly by telephone.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGrothman said Baldwin introduced a bill to require doctors and other health care workers to ask patients, &quot;including young children, whether they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or if they know their gender identity.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s an element of truth in Grothman&rsquo;s claim, in that the bill would have required a federal agency to collect such data. But there was no requirement that doctors or other health care workers question their patients.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Grothman&rsquo;s statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-17T13:54:04.578130", "ruling_date": "2012-10-23T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "GOP lawmaker claims Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin would force doctors to ask patients about sexual orientation", "ruling_headline_slug": "gop-lawmaker-claims-senate-candidate-tammy-baldwin", "ruling_link_text": "Data collection required, but no requirement on health care workers", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tGlenn Grothman campaign, <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=280647\">news release</a>, Sept. 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview and email interview, Sen.
