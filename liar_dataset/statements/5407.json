Bill Pascrell, medical bills have led about two-thirds of small businesses nationwide to close during the past five years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPascrell (D-8th Dist.) pointed to that startling statistic during a Feb. 1 debate in the House over a bill repealing the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, or the CLASS Act. That Act was a provision of the health care reform law enacted in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe CLASS Act was meant to create a new insurance program for individuals to pay monthly premiums and later receive a cash benefit to support their long-term care needs. But before the program was implemented, federal officials canceled it in October 2011, pointing to legal and financial concerns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We have to find a way to make long-term care both accessible and affordable. These problems will not simply disappear. They&#39;re not going to go away,&quot; Pascrell told his colleagues. &quot;This bill certainly does not fix these problems. The bill does not even provide an alternative. All it does is attack the progress made in the Affordable Care Act.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPascrell added, &quot;Sixty-two percent of small businesses over the last five years went under because they couldn&#39;t pay their health care bills, and you stand there with no alternative whatsoever.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat bill passed in a 267-159 vote, with Pascrell voting against it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut PolitiFact New Jersey found it hard to believe that 62 percent of small businesses had closed during the past five years. After reaching out to Pascrell&rsquo;s spokesman, we found out why: the statement&rsquo;s not true.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPascrell spokesman Paul Brubaker told us the congressman meant to say that &quot;62 percent of personal bankruptcies in 2007 were due to health care costs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He mistakenly said &lsquo;small businesses&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;personal bankruptcies&rsquo; and &lsquo;past five years&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;five years ago,&rsquo;&quot; Brubaker added in an email. &quot;Congressman Pascrell stands by his overall point that personal bankruptcies have been demonstrably connected to health care costs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s good enough for the Truth-O-Meter. But let&rsquo;s explain the basis for the statistic that Pascrell was aiming for.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo back up the congressman&rsquo;s point, Brubaker directed us to a report published in 2009 in The American Journal of Medicine.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFollowing a national study, researchers estimated in that report that illness or medical bills contributed to 62.1 percent of all bankruptcies in 2007 -- a significant jump from six years earlier. Many families were under-insured, leaving them responsible for large out-of-pocket costs, while others lost their private health insurance when they became too sick to work, according to the study.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Since 2001, the proportion of all bankruptcies attributable to medical problems has increased by 50%,&quot; according to the report. &quot;Nearly two thirds of all bankruptcies are now linked to illness.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs for small businesses, their numbers have declined in recent years, but that reduction is much less than 62 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the U.S. Small Business Administration&rsquo;s Office of Advocacy, the number of small employers -- defined as having fewer than 500 employees -- dropped by about 4.2 percent from 6,004,056 in 2006 to 5,749,797 in 2009, which is the latest data available.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe don&rsquo;t know how much medical bills contributed to that reduction, but health care costs obviously remain a significant concern for small business owners.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a speech on the House floor, Pascrell claimed that &quot;sixty-two percent of small businesses over the last five years went under because they couldn&#39;t pay their health care bills.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut his spokesman told us the congressman made a mistake and cited the wrong statistic. Pascrell meant to say health care costs led to 62 percent of personal bankruptcies five years ago.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/politifact_nj_congressman_pasc.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-02-23T10:56:46.693497", "ruling_date": "2012-02-24T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Bill Pascrell claims health care bills forced 62 percent of small businesses to shut down during the past five years", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-pascrell-claims-heath-care-bills-forced-62-pe", "ruling_link_text": "Citing the wrong statistic", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;C-SPAN, <a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/304094-2&amp;personid=45543\">Congressman Bill Pascrell speaks during House session</a>, Feb. 1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Record, Remarks by Congressman Bill Pascrell, Feb. 1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThomas.gov, Summary of Fiscal Responsibility and Retirement Security Act of 2011, accessed Feb. 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone and email interviews with Paul Brubaker, <a href=\"http://pascrell.house.gov/\">a spokesman for Congressman Bill Pascrell</a>, Feb. 14-15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe American Journal of Medicine, <a href=\"http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0002-9343/PIIS0002934309004045.pdf\">Medical Bankruptcy in the United States, 2007: Results of a National Study</a>, June 5, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOffice of House Speaker John Boehner, <a href=\"http://boehner.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=277725\">House Repeals CLASS Act, Continues Dismantling Health Care Law That&rsquo;s Hurting Small Businesses</a>, Feb. 1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHuffington Post, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/01/class-act-repeal_n_1248430.html\">House Votes To Repeal CLASS Act, Part Of 2010 Obama Health Care Law</a>, Feb. 1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, <a href=\"http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/2011/class/index.pdf\">A Report on the Actuarial, Marketing, and Legal Analyses of the CLASS Program</a>, Oct. 14, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKauffman-Rand Institute for Entrepreneurship Public Policy, <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/technical_reports/2008/RAND_TR559.pdf\">The Economic Burden of Providing Health Insurance: How Much Worse Off Are Small Firms?</a>, 2008<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSmall Business Majority, <a href=\"http://smallbusinessmajority.org/_pdf/SBM-economic_impact_061009.pdf\">The Economic Impact of Healthcare Reform on Small Business</a>, June 11, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Henry J.
