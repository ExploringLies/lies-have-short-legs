Nathan Deal has promised financially strapped local school districts that better days are ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He started down that road last year. When running for re-election, he won legislative approval of a 2015 state budget that reduced the education austerity cut to $747 million, the lowest since 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his latest State of the State address, Deal said public education remains a budget priority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This year&rsquo;s budget, coupled with my proposal for next year&rsquo;s budget, represents an infusion of over one billion additional dollars for K-12 education,&quot; he told a joint session of the state House and Senate on Jan. 14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those were sweet-sounding words to educators. But do they ring true?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Georgia decided to check now that state lawmakers have met for their annual 40-day session and approved a 2015 revised state budget, as well as a budget of about $21.8 billion for 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We began our fact-check by contacting Jen Talaber, a Deal spokeswoman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talaber said the governor put more than $1.2 billion in additional money into K-12 education in the two budget cycles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, the state Department of Education received $535,118,581 in the Fiscal 2015 budget, $139,242,817 in the 2015 amended budget and $557,647,889 in the 2016 budget, for a total of $1,232,009,287, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A majority of the money is going to two big-ticket items: reducing the austerity cuts and covering annual student enrollment growth, state records show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An austerity cut is the gap between what a district needs to provide a quality education to all its students, as determined by the Quality Basic Education (QBE) formula, and the amount of money the General Assembly and governor approve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first austerity cut was implemented in 2003, pre-Great Recession. In the years that have followed, the state&rsquo;s 180 local districts have collectively been shortchanged about $8 billion, based on the formula.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, many districts have raised class sizes, abandoned the traditional 180-day school calendar, dropped electives and furloughed staff in recent years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deal last year reduced the annual austerity cut -- which had hovered around $1 billion -- to $747 million by sending the districts collectively an additional $314 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the upcoming fiscal year, he proposed and lawmakers approved giving them an additional $280 million to reduce the austerity cut to about $460 million. Those back-to-back austerity reductions absorbed about $594 million -- or nearly half of the $1.2 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Student enrollment growth took another big share. For example, the 2015 amended state budget included $128.5 million to send to school districts for new students who enrolled last August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That doesn&rsquo;t enable us to provide new services,&quot; said Claire Suggs an education policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget &amp; Policy Institute, said of the enrollment payments. &quot;We&rsquo;re just keeping up.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the recent General Assembly session, lawmakers agreed that 22,000 part-time school employees and their dependents should be able to remain on the State Health Benefit Plan, &nbsp;the state&#39;s health insurance program for teachers, retirees and state workers. Deal had proposed booting part-time school bus drivers and cafeteria workers off the coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But both chambers said local school districts need to come up with $103 million more in the upcoming year to pay for coverage for the so-called non-certified school employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Ruling: The governor said in his State of the State address that the 2015 and 2016 state budgets represent an infusion of $1 billion in additional money for K-12 education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To districts that, in 2014, collectively were living with $1 billion in austerity cuts and next year will see those reduced to about $460 billion, that probably does seem rejuvenating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deal&rsquo;s statement is accurate, but also misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A billion-plus additional dollars will be in the budget, but most of the money is going to cover routine growth in student enrollment and to reduce austerity cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the governor&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-04-13T16:09:55.007151", "ruling_date": "2015-04-14T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Deal's statement on education funding missing critical context", "ruling_headline_slug": "deals-statement-education-funding-missing-critical", "ruling_link_text": "Austerity cuts have existed since 2003", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>&quot;State of the State; Great <a href=\"https://gov.georgia.gov/press-releases/2015-01-14/state-state-great-challenges-require-great-cooperation\">challenges </a>require great cooperation,&quot; Jan. 14, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email with Jen Talaber, spokesperson for Gov.
