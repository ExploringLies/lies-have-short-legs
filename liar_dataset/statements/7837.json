And one former Georgia lawmaker offers that advice to the federal government.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCharlie Smith, a former state representative from St. Mary&rsquo;s, says if the U.S. really wants to save money, it would replace the $1 bill with the not-so-popular $1 coin. Smith, now an attorney with a Brunswick firm, has been beating this drum for years. He kept the momentum going this month in a newspaper article.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSmith told a Brunswick News reporter that the federal government could save $500 million a year by circulating $1 coins instead of $1 bills, and that there were four studies to support the savings claim.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt PolitiFact, we&rsquo;re fond of money, be it paper or coin. So Smith&rsquo;s savings claim was intriguing. We decided to investigate further.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDuring his 10 years in the state Legislature, Smith was a floor leader for then-Gov. Roy Barnes. These days he&rsquo;s still leading, but he admits his coin cause is almost unwinnable.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;They&rsquo;ve started calling me Charlie &lsquo;Don Quixote&rsquo; Smith because I&rsquo;m fighting windmills,&quot; he told us about his campaign to phase out $1 bills.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSmith said he was slightly misquoted in the Brunswick News article. He did say the government could save $500 million a year with the $1 coins, but that amount was cited in just one study. And since then the savings figure has been revised downward.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe studies that Smith references are those done by the independent, nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office, which works for Congress and acts as a watchdog for how the federal government spends taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe GAO has released several reports over the past decade on the net benefit to the government of replacing the $1 bill with a $1 coin. A report released in<a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/archive/2000/gg00111r.pdf\"> 2000</a> included the $500 million annual savings figure that Smith mentions. But since that year, the GAO studies have estimated less in annual savings.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLast year, in <a href=\"http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-112-ba19-wstate-lstjames-20121129.pdf\">testimony</a> before a congressional committee, the GAO estimated a savings of about $4.4 billion over 30 years, or an average of about $150 million per year. It also repeated a recommendation that the dollar bill be phased out over a four-year transition period.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe savings included in the studies is based on economics. Coins last longer than paper bills, and dollar coins don&rsquo;t cost more than they are worth to produce (for example, it costs more than<a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1508.aspx\"> twice</a> the face value of the penny and nickel to produce them).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe life span of a dollar coin is 30 years. On the other hand, it costs <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12771.htm\">5.4 cents</a> to produce every $1 bill, which has a life span of <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/how-long-is-the-life-span-of-us-paper-money.htm\">5.9 years</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDespite the savings, there&rsquo;s a problem. People don&rsquo;t like the coins. Toward the end of last year, there were <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/business/kill-bill-us-says-dollar-coins-would-save-4-4b-1C7350149\">$1.4 billion </a>&nbsp;in dollar coins piled up in Federal Reserve vaults.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLike Smith, other proponents of the $1 coin disagree with the GAO&rsquo;s latest and much lower annual savings figures.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA GAO report released in November said the $1 coin hadn&rsquo;t really caught on with the public because the $1 bill was still in circulation. Also, savings were lower partly because new equipment to process the bills was allowing for a longer life span. (Early studies had listed the $1 bill&rsquo;s life span at about 18 months). And the government was going to cut back on production of the coins and use the extra coins already in storage.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;We think (the federal government) is gaming the numbers a bit,&quot; Shawn Smeallie, executive</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tdirector of the Dollar Coin Alliance, says about the lower savings figures. The Federal Reserve improvements to increase the dollar bill&rsquo;s life span haven&rsquo;t been implemented yet, Smeallie says, and he thinks the costs for producing the coins is overstated.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHis group estimates the annual savings of the bill-to-coin switch would be about $366 million. The Dollar Coin Alliance -- a mix of vendors, mass transit agencies and trade associations that could benefit from the change -- is pushing for a Senate hearing this session for a bill on the change.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhatever happens, Smith is doing his best to circulate the coins in his hometown. But even there, where his crusade is well-known, he gets some pushback from people who don&rsquo;t want the &quot;Charlie coins.&quot; And when he travels to Atlanta and passes the coins off to cashiers, they usually ask whether he&rsquo;s been riding MARTA. The public transit agency gives change in the $1 coins.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo does Smith&rsquo;s claim add up?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe former state lawmaker said that circulating $1 coins instead of $1 bills could save the federal government $500 million a year. A newspaper featuring Smith&rsquo;s story and statements misquoted the former state lawmaker and overstated his claim.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne of the several federal studies, completed over a decade ago, about the bill-to-coin switch does include the $500 million savings estimate. Other studies since then have included lower savings claims.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe overarching point of Smith&rsquo;s statement was the potential savings of the $1 currency change. This is true. Moving to coins from paper money would save taxpayers&rsquo; money in the long run.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut Smith cherry-picked the study with the largest amount of savings. He cited $500 million. The most recent study showed the saving at about $150 million, far less than Smith cited.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rated Smith&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-05-30T16:09:45.941091", "ruling_date": "2013-05-31T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Too much value placed on one report about $1 coins", "ruling_headline_slug": "too-much-value-placed-one-report-about-1-coins", "ruling_link_text": "A little too loose with the change", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;Coin advocate hoping $1 bill folds into history,&quot; Gordon Jackson, Brunswick News, May 6, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFederal Reserve website, <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12771.htm\">FAQs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12771.htm\">www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12771.htm</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.
