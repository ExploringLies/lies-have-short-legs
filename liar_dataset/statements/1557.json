Dave Aronberg, a Democratic candidate for attorney general, is trying to appeal across party lines with an eye toward the general election. He's portraying himself as a politician focused on principles rather than partisan warfare.<br /><br />The \"About Dave\" page on his campaign Web site says, \"The<em> Naples Daily News</em> called him 'the real deal,' and Governor Charlie Crist has praised him as \"a rock star.\" It does not explain the context or source for the Crist quote. <br /><br />Given how partisan politics have become, it's surprising to see such favorable comments from someone of the opposite party. So we wondered if the Republican governor really described a Democratic legislator and attorney in such favorable terms.</p>\r\n<p>We found the quote in an April 19, 2007, <a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2007/04/aronberg_is_cri.html\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on the <em>Miami Herald</em>'s <a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/\" target=\"_blank\">Naked Politics blog</a> titled, appropriately, \"Aronberg is Crist's 'rockstar.' \" Here's what it said:</p>\r\n<p><em>\"To be honest, about anything Sen. Aronberg does is important to me,\"  Crist said when asked about Aronberg's proposal to revise state sex  offender residency rules. \"The guy is brilliant. He's a rockstar, and I  have such great respect for him. And he's just a good, decent man. And  almost everything I can think of that he's ever promoted or pushed has  been something I'm able to support gladly.\"</em><br /><br />The \"rock star\" quote was repeated in several other articles, mostly in the <em>Palm Beach Post</em>. A May 14, 2007, <em>Palm Beach Post</em> article said: \"After Crist gushed last month about Greenacres Democratic state Sen. Dave Aronberg ('The guy is brilliant. I mean, he's almost a rock star.'), Aronberg got a tape and planned to give it to his mom for Mother's Day.\"</p>\r\n<p>You'll notice the <em>Post</em> version of the quote includes the qualifier \"almost,\" but we listened to audio from the original <em>Miami Herald</em> interview and indeed Crist unequivocally says, \"He's a rock star.\"<br /><br />The \"rock star\" quote even played a role in a debate among Republicans about whether to support Aronberg. A Palm Beach County-based lobbyist&nbsp;wanted to launch a Republican committee to endorse Aronberg \"citing the Democrat as 'honest' and having 'integrity,' and invoking Crist's praise of Aronberg as a 'rock star,' \" the <em>Palm Beach Post</em> reported July 19, 2008. Then party chair Jim Greer nixed the idea of the Republican party backing the Democrat.<br /><br />So Aronberg is correct. Crist sang his praises and put him on the big stage. We find his claim True.</p>\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This item was updated on March 6, 2010, because audio of the original quote shows Crist did not use \"almost\" as a qualifier.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-05T16:09:30.441528", "ruling_date": "2010-03-05T18:24:02", "ruling_headline": "Aronberg says Crist called him \"rock star\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "aronberg-says-crist-called-him-rock-star", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, Charlie is an Aronberg groupie", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>State Sen.
