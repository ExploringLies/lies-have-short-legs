But Chicago has more guns on the streets, Mayor Rahm Emanuel told CNN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was his answer when CNN host Jake Tapper asked on April 2, 2013: With some of the nation&rsquo;s strictest gun laws, why are your homicide rates still so high?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without uniform gun policies &mdash; say, in neighboring Indiana and Wisconsin &mdash; weapons still flow, Emanuel said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We take more guns off the streets than New York or L.A.,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emanuel, who formerly was President Barack Obama&#39;s&nbsp; White House chief of staff, is part of a <a href=\"http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/members/members.shtml\">group of mayors</a> that&rsquo;s fighting for stricter national gun laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were curious: Does America&rsquo;s No. 3 most populous city take No. 1 in gun seizures?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chicago&rsquo;s guns</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We talked with Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman in Emanuel&rsquo;s office. He said the city uses the comparison with New York and Los Angeles to demonstrate that Chicago&rsquo;s strict gun control rules won&rsquo;t work by themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Opponents of gun control measures argue the city offers evidence that such laws <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-08/news/ct-met-gun-lawsuits-20120308_1_gun-rights-gun-control-gun-owners\">don&rsquo;t work</a>, period.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York and California both have stricter gun control laws than Illinois. Guns cross into Chicago not just from Indiana and Wisconsin, but from areas right outside the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Chicago is not an island,&quot; McCaffrey said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first six months of last year, the city &mdash; not counting gun buybacks or turn-ins &mdash; seized 3,912 guns. That&rsquo;s as many as New York and Los Angeles combined, according to the University of Chicago Crime Lab, which got numbers from the cities&rsquo; police departments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Chicago, police picked up illegal weapons at crime scenes and traffic stops, found them with search warrants and investigations, or heard about them when people called 911 to report a &quot;man with a gun&quot; or &quot;shots fired.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the same months that Chicago recovered 3,912 guns, Los Angeles got 2,296 and New York 1,385.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That wasn&rsquo;t an anomaly, according to Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, who has testified before Congress in favor of strengthening federal measures to reduce gun trafficking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For several years under the Clinton administration, an effort to fight youth crime collected gun-tracing data for major U.S. cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can tell you that Chicago consistently recovered more guns than any of the other cities, N.Y.C. and L.A. included,&quot; Webster said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We pulled those reports from <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov/publications/historical/ycgii/ycgii-report-1998.html\">1998</a>, <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov/publications/historical/ycgii/ycgii-report-1999.html\">1999</a> and <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov/publications/historical/ycgii/ycgii-report-2000.html\">2000</a>. Chicago recovered and traced more guns than either New York or Los Angeles in all three years. In 1998, it picked up 16,222 weapons &mdash; more than the two larger cities together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Webster points out that the city has a lot of gangs, and gangs and guns go together. Its police department cracks down on illegal gun possession, making arrests more likely. And Illinois gun control laws aren&rsquo;t nearly as strong as those in New York and California in deterring gun trafficking into the city, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Webster told House Democrats in March that studies show state gun laws are undermined by gaps in federal law &mdash; people buy guns in states with the weakest laws to sell in states with the toughest laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same idea works for counties and cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Chicago, all it takes is a drive outside the city limits, the <em>New York Times</em> reported, such as to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/us/strict-chicago-gun-laws-cant-stem-fatal-shots.html\">Chuck&rsquo;s Gun Shop</a> in Riverdale, Ill., the source of more than 1,300 weapons seized in Chicago since 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same store was identified as a key source of crime guns in a <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/23/us/cities-turn-to-us-gun-tracing-data-for-legal-assault-on-industry.html\">New York Times</a></em> piece in 1999.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emanuel, arguing for stronger federal laws to help Chicago tamp down on gun crime, said, &quot;we take more guns off the streets than New York or L.A.&quot; Gun seizure data gathered by the University of Chicago Crime Lab and a federal youth crime initiative show just that.
