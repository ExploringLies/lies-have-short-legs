She issued a statement saying she was not comparing President Obama to Hitler, had not researched the posted material and had made no comment on it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA little research might have saved a lot of trouble.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur friends at the myth-busting site Snopes.com could not find any source documenting the purported Hitler quote. Neither could Salon.com, which pointed us to a 2004 paper by University of Chicago law professor Bernard Harcourt. He found the quote &quot;is probably a fraud and was likely never uttered.&quot; (Harcourt further noted that the Weimar government immediately before Hitler&rsquo;s had tougher gun laws than the Nazi regime.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTerhar, who is married to Ohio Rep. Lou Terhar, said in a statement that she regretted &quot;the consequences of carelessly sharing&quot; the posted material and would be &quot;more selective in my use of social media in the future.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGov. John Kasich said he saw no need for further action.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It was clearly a mistake, and she says it was a mistake,&quot; he told the Dispatch from the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. &quot;I&rsquo;m glad that she&rsquo;s come out and said she&rsquo;s sorry about it, that it&rsquo;s a mistake, and she&rsquo;s not going to do it again.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOhio Democrats led calls for Terhar to resign. Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern went further in a statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In absence of a full, formal apology from Terhar,&quot; Redfern said, &quot;Kasich has a duty to remove his hand-picked state school board president from office.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA subsequent email from Redfern that solicited letters to Kasich and the school board demanding Terhar&#39;s resignation carried the subject line, &quot;Tell Kasich: Fire Terhar!&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio wondered if Kasich had the power to do that. We called Redfern&#39;s office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA party spokesman, Jerid Kurtz, told us that Redfern understands Kasich has no direct formal power to remove Terhar, but Kasich does have a bully pulpit as the state&#39;s most visible and arguably most powerful public figure. The governor should issue a statement of no confidence, rather than his initial &quot;no comment,&quot; and can pressure Terhar to resign as president, Kurtz said for Redfern.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKurtz noted that Kasich showed power over the board two years ago by forcing out Superintendent Deborah Delisle, who resigned, citing pressure from the governor&rsquo;s office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state superintendent serves at the discretion of the board. Delisle said in a letter to board members that Kasich&rsquo;s administration had informed her that a majority of the board would replace her if she did not step down. The same day, Terhar was elected board president by fellow board members with Kasich&rsquo;s support, reversing the outcome of a vote two months earlier.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing that example, one would conclude that if Kasich wanted Terhar gone from the president&rsquo;s chair, he has the influence to make it happen.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRemoving her from the board altogether would be a different matter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe board is made up of 19 members. Eleven are elected on a district basis, and eight are appointed by the governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTerhar, self-described as &quot;an early participant in the Tea Party,&quot; is an elected member from Cincinnati representing Hamilton and Warren counties. She started her four-year term on Jan. 1, 2011, was elected board president in March 2011 and re-elected unanimously by the board to the post last month.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHer seat on the board is not among the positions subject to removal at the pleasure of the governor under the Ohio Revised Code.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the code and the state constitution, in fact, Ohio lacks any provision for the recall of state officials.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what&#39;s the verdict here?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTerhar posted a bogus quotation and false history. Whether there should be consequences is a matter of opinion that we can&#39;t rate. That includes calls for her resignation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRedfern&#39;s statement that Kasich &quot;has a duty to remove&quot; her, however, means that Kasich has the power to do so.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Democratic Party spokesman, explaining Redfern&rsquo;s remarks, said the call for Terhar&rsquo;s resignation or removal extended only to her position as school board president, not as a board member. That&rsquo;s an important distinction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe acknowledged that Kasich does not have statutory control over the Board of Education, but he accurately cited Kasich&rsquo;s forcing out of a state school superintendent as a demonstration of the governor&rsquo;s power over the board.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Redfern&rsquo;s statement as Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-02-06T17:03:17.952933", "ruling_date": "2013-02-07T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern says Gov.
