Nowadays, U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson is fighting for Brownies and Girl Scout cookies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJohnson serves on the House Judiciary Committee, which held a hearing Feb. 28 on whether insurance companies should be required to cover contraception as parts of the health care overhaul go into effect. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJohnson appeared with a box of Thin Mints and a passel of questions for Jeanne Monahan, an official with the socially conservative Family Research Council. She was testifying against the requirement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Your organization, ma&#39;am, sponsored a &lsquo;prayer in&rsquo; -- a prayer vigil -- to stop people from buying Girl Scout cookies because you allege Girl Scout cookies is affiliated with Planned Parenthood. Isn&rsquo;t that correct?&quot; Johnson asked.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Sir, I am not aware of any prayer vigil that my organization has organized for to stop people from buying Girl Scout cookies,&quot; Monahan replied. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA prayer vigil against buying Girl Scout cookies? We had to find out more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted Johnson spokesman Andrew Phelan, who sent us links to stories from left-leaning websites about the Family Research Council. He also sent us a link to a posting on the FRC&rsquo;s website that displayed the text of <a href=\"http://www.frc.org/prayerteam/prayer-targets-revival-obamacare-military-planned-parenthood-scouts-pastors-islam-colleges\">an email sent out by the organization&rsquo;s Prayer Team</a>. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEvery week, this email asks readers to say prayers on public policy issues. The FRC Prayer Team&rsquo;s email Feb. 8 asked that they pray against the health care overhaul&rsquo;s contraception coverage requirements, the U.S. military&rsquo;s treatment of religion and Planned Parenthood.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt mentioned Girl Scout cookie sales.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Girl Scouts, whose leadership has been collaborating with Planned Parenthood for years, have found out that their cookie sales are suffering. This is very sensitive for the Scouts,&quot; it said. &quot;The Scouts had better confess their errors and make a clean break while they can.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(This item does not address whether the Girl Scouts have been &quot;collaborating&quot; with Planned Parenthood.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe email suggested a prayer:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>&quot;May Congress expose and defund Planned Parenthood and may private organizations refuse to submit to shakedowns by Planned Parenthood and others in the abortion advocacy industry. May the Pro-life Majority grow in America until abortion has been abolished.&quot; </em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis prayer does not target the Girl Scouts by name -- just &quot;private organizations.&quot; But the email does single out the Scouts and mentions no other private organizations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Family Research Council&rsquo;s leaders have repeatedly warned the group&rsquo;s supporters that Girl Scout cookie profits go to an organization that they think is on the wrong side of the family values debate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn op-eds &quot;<a href=\"http://www.frc.org/op-eds/say-no-to-girl-scout-cookies\">Say no to Girl Scout Cookies</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href=\"http://www.frc.org/op-eds/planned-parenthood-girl-scout-cookie-monster\">Planned Parenthood, Girl Scout cookie monster</a>,&quot; Cathy Cleaver Ruse, a senior fellow with the Family Research Council, blasted the Scouts for what she described as working in partnership with Planned Parenthood and deciding to admit a transgendered boy into a Colorado troop.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFRC President Tony Perkins said that &quot;when they&rsquo;re not partnering with Planned Parenthood, they&rsquo;re promoting sexual diversity.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut FRC spokesman J.P. Duffy told PolitiFact Georgia that the group has &quot;neither held nor called for a &lsquo;prayer vigil&rsquo;.&quot; We found no evidence that one took place.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the FRC knows how to call for a prayer vigil. Last year, it held one against Planned Parenthood and sex trafficking, which it said are connected. (We&rsquo;re not going to address that claim in this item, either.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur ruling:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJohnson said the Family Research Council sponsored a &quot;prayer vigil&quot; to stop people from buying Girl Scout cookies because the group&rsquo;s members think that Girl Scouts are affiliated with Planned Parenthood.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe can say that an op-ed on the FRC website asks consumers to say no to Do-Si-Dos.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s also fair to say that the FRC prayer team singled out the Girl Scouts in one of its prayers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the FRC did not call for an actual prayer vigil.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd while the FRC came close to asking people to pray that consumers stop buying Thin Mints, it stopped just shy of doing so.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe give Johnson a Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-08T17:42:49.856965", "ruling_date": "2012-03-09T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Congressman: Conservative group held \"prayer vigil\" against Girl Scout cookie sales ", "ruling_headline_slug": "congressman-conservative-group-prayed-against-girl", "ruling_link_text": "Prayer?
