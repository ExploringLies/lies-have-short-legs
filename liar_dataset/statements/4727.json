He lauded Allen as a &quot;great governor&quot; from 1994 to 1998. But Stewart said Allen&rsquo;s term in the Senate, from 2001 to 2007, was &quot;<a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/11/stewart_says_george_allen_had.html\">mediocre</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He did nothing to control the expansion and the growth of the federal government during his tenure in the Senate,&quot;Stewart said. He faulted Allen -- who lost his reelection bid in 2006 to Democrat Jim Webb -- &nbsp;for supporting budgets that increased debt and backing the expansion of Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;George Allen is part of the problem, not the solution,&quot; Stewart said in an <a href=\"http://www.nbcwashington.com/video/#!/news/politics/About-Face--Stewart-Endorses-Allen-for-Senate/133034373\">article</a> that ran in The Washington Times on Dec. 28, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn several interviews, Stewart even expressed revulsion Allen&rsquo;s often-stated reverence for Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s views on limited government. &quot;Frankly, it makes by stomach turn a bit because Thomas Jefferson would not have voted to expand the scope of the federal government,&quot; he said in the Jan. 24 TV interview.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Jefferson would be rolling over in his grave if he heard Allen quote him,&quot; Stewart said in a Jan. 25 article in The Washington Post.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s fast forward to Nov. 1, 2011, when Stewart, appeared at a news conference with Allen. &quot;I hereby endorse and give my full support to George Allen for the United States Senate in 2012,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStewart was asked about his characterization of Allen as a &quot;mediocre&quot; senator. &quot;All in all, I&rsquo;ve got to say that I retract that statement and I have to say he had a very good senate record,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat explains the change? Stewart, in a phone interview, said his negative comments about Allen earlier this year were fueled by his own interest in running for the Senate in 2012 -- an ambition he has since dropped.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Obviously, that colored my view,&quot; he said. &quot;I&rsquo;m an ambitious fellow, I&rsquo;ll be frank about that, and at that point I was only seeing the bad (in Allen).&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlthough Stewart said he still does not agree with some of the votes Allen cast during his first term, he is convinced that Allen would compile a more conservative record if he is elected to the Senate again.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The country has changed,&quot; he said. &quot;There&rsquo;s been a huge wake-up signal sent by the Tea Party that they no longer want a wishy-washy Republican Party. They want a party that pares back the role of government and spending. George gets that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStewart also said Allen offers the best hope in next year&rsquo;s Senate race for defeating former Gov. Tim Kaine, the presumptive Democratic nominee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStewart&rsquo;s endorsement of Allen is not a difficult case for on our Flip-O-Meter.
