The Republican Party is in the midst of such a process right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mike Murphy, a GOP political strategist, has argued that the Republicans need to address why they lost so badly among two demographics: the young and Latinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama crushed McCain among Hispanic voters by a 35-point margin, Murphy wrote in <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1904136,00.html\" target=\"_blank\"> a column in <em> Time </em> </a> magazine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;By 2030, the Latino share of the vote is likely to double,&quot; Murphy wrote. &quot;In Texas, the crucial buckle for the GOP&#39;s Electoral College belt, the No. 1 name for new male babies &mdash; many of whom will vote one day &mdash; is Jose.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy added, &quot;Latinos need to see a quick end to the Republican congressional jihad on immigration,&quot; Murphy concluded, adding that they should support immigration reform with a path to citizenship. &quot;Republicans should differentiate themselves from the left by heating up the lukewarm American melting pot with a firm insistence on learning English and a rejection of the silly excesses of identity politics.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were intrigued by his claim &mdash; which he repeated on <em> Meet the Press </em> on June 14 &mdash; that Jose was the No. 1 baby name for boys in Texas. We wondered if that could be proved with hard numbers or if it was mostly conjecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out that the Social Security Administration compiles <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"> baby names </a> for infants born in the United States, based on applications for Social Security numbers. The administration includes <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/background.html\" target=\"_blank\"> a few caveats </a> about the data &mdash; names are counted only when the year of birth, state, and gender are known, for example. But it&#39;s hard to think of a better source for name popularity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2008, the No. 1 name for a baby boy born in Texas was indeed Jose. (It&#39;s held the top spot since 1996.) Nationally, it was 41st.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Texas, Jose was followed by Jacob, Daniel, Christopher, Joshua, David, Angel, Ethan, Juan and Michael.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case you&#39;re wondering, that same year in Texas, the most popular name for a girl was Emily, followed by Isabella, Abigail, Emma, Madison, Sophia, Mia, Natalie, Ashley and Ava.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re not rating Murphy&#39;s political advice one way or the other. But the numbers confirm he had his facts right about Jose. We rate Murphy&#39;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:27:42.400665", "ruling_date": "2009-06-15T14:04:41", "ruling_headline": "Jose is No. 1 baby name in Texas \u2014 Social Security Administration says so", "ruling_headline_slug": "jose-no-1-baby-name-texas-social-security-administ", "ruling_link_text": "Yes way, Jose!", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Social Security Administration, <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/namesbystate.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Popular Baby Names by State </a> , Texas, 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Time </em> magazine, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1904136,00.html\" target=\"_blank\"> The Ice Man Cometh </a> , by Mike Murphy, June 22, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31343018/ns/meet_the_press_online_at_msnbc/page/5/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Meet the Press </em> transcript </a> , June 15, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#USP00p1\" target=\"_blank\"> 2008 presidential election exit polls </a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "political strategist", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Mike", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 178, "last_name": "Murphy", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "mike-murphy", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/Mike_Murphy.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/178/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.mikemurphycommentary.com/"}, "statement": "<p>In Texas, &quot;the No. 1 name for new male babies &mdash; many of whom will vote one day &mdash; is Jose.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a column in Time magazine.", "statement_date": "2009-06-12", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>Amnesty,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">self-deportation</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/donald-trump-mexico-immigration-presidential-campaign\">wall</a>.
