Bush.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Since both you and President Bush are Republicans, I fear a return to the policies of those years should you win this election,&quot; said undecided voter Susan Katz. &quot;What is the biggest difference between you and George W. Bush, and how do you differentiate yourself from George W. Bush?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney detailed several ways he would depart from Bush&rsquo;s policies, then President Barack Obama chimed in, saying Romney was actually further to the right than Bush.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Gov. Romney and George Bush,&quot; Obama said, as one example.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlanned Parenthood provides low-cost reproductive health services but is also the nation&rsquo;s leading provider of abortions. Romney and other Republicans have vowed to eliminate its federal funding, a move Obama opposes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut where did the 43rd president stand on the subject? We decided to check it out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Planned Parenthood and federal funding</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe organization, founded in 1921, has received federal funds since 1970, when President Richard Nixon signed a law amending the Public Health Service Act. Title X of that law provides funding for family planning services, including contraception and family planning information.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlanned Parenthood now operates more than 800 clinics in all 50 states. The bulk of their work is women&rsquo;s health care: cancer screenings, STD treatment, sex education, contraceptives, pregnancy care and breast exams. In many states, they also perform abortions -- more than 330,000 a year. The group receives millions in federal money every year, in the form of grants and reimbursements for the health services its provides. In 2009, its <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/04/13/135354952/planned-parenthood-makes-abortion-foes-see-red\">federal funding totalled $360 million</a>. <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/PPFA/PP_by_the_Numbers.pdf\">Planned Parenthood says</a> abortions account for 3 percent of its services, which are prohibited from being paid for with public money. The group says it is careful to keep the money separate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, it&rsquo;s that 3 percent that makes it a target in the national abortion battle.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>What Bush did</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn one of his first acts as president, Bush reinstated what is known as the Mexico City policy, or&nbsp;(as abortion rights advocates called it)&nbsp;the global gag rule, in January 2001. The rule denies money to overseas family planning clinics (such as Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s international arm) that provide abortion counseling in foreign countries.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the end of Bush&rsquo;s term, International Planned Parenthood Federation said that during those eight years, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-musimbi-kanyoro/womens-reproductive-rights_b_1970978.html\">they lost more than $100 million</a> for family planning and health programs. The consequence of losing those funds, the group said: 36 million unplanned pregnancies and 15 million induced abortions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Obama took office, he revoked the Mexico City policy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>What Bush didn&rsquo;t do</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs president, Bush called himself a &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; and spoke of supporting &quot;a culture of life.&quot; He steered money to faith-based groups, and he signed a federal ban on late-term abortions in 2003. When he ran for re-election in 2004, Planned Parenthood endorsed Democrat John Kerry, the first time the group formally backed a presidential candidate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat said, we searched media reports from Bush&rsquo;s eight years in office and found no instances of the president pushing to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s work in the United States. We contacted Planned Parenthood itself, which also couldn&rsquo;t cite evidence of Bush targeting their federal money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the contrary, we found ample evidence that Bush was satisfied with the status quo. In 1999, when he was first running for president, he declined to sign a pledge to defund Planned Parenthood, saying he supported &quot;incremental changes helpful to America&#39;s pro-life movement.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Obama campaign also pointed us to information on Title X funding (which pays for the health services Planned Parenthood provides) during the Bush years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis 2002 budget proposal eliminated contraceptive coverage for federal employees but maintained funding for Title X, including $66 million for Planned Parenthood. A budget bill he signed in 2007 provided &quot;the largest increase in Title X family planning funding since 2000, a $16.8 million increase from the previous year,&quot; according to a <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/victories-in-signed-budget-bill-18841.htm\">Planned Parenthood press release</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Romney&rsquo;s stance</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEliminating funding for Planned Parenthood has gotten more attention since a Republican majority, backed by the new tea party wave of conservatism, took control of the House of Representatives in 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This is when we&#39;re going to defund Planned Parenthood. Now is the season for us to do this,&quot; Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., said in February 2011. (Stearns later lost his primary battle to a more ardent tea party candidate.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe House voted in February 2011 to block Planned Parenthood funding, and all money for family planning. (The Democrat-controlled Senate rejected the package.) The message also caught on in the Republican presidential primary contest. Newt Gingrich, at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition dinner that same month, said, &quot;I would immediately move to defund Planned Parenthood and take that money and devote it to adoption services to create an alternative to abortion.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney, for his part, has repeatedly pledged to revoke Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s funding. <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/spending\">His website</a> says he would &quot;eliminate Title X Family Planning Funding &mdash; Savings: $300 Million. Title X subsidizes family planning programs that benefit abortion groups like Planned Parenthood.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd after he told the <em>Des Moines Register</em> on Oct. 9, 2012, that there&rsquo;s no abortion legislation on his agenda, he was forced to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/10/romney-ill-be-a-pro-life-president/\">re-state his anti-abortion stance</a>: &quot;The actions I&rsquo;ll take immediately is to remove funding for Planned Parenthood. It will not be part of my budget. And also I&rsquo;ve indicated that I will reverse the Mexico City position of the president.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith the spotlight on the organization, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards told the <em>Washington Post</em> in August, &quot;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this. I&rsquo;ve never seen a presidential election where women&rsquo;s basic access to birth control is practically on the ballot. Defunding Planned Parenthood is practically on the ballot. It&rsquo;s been incredible to witness the last year and a half and this debate we&rsquo;ve had over access to care. ... This is not something that John McCain was campaigning to do. George Bush wasn&rsquo;t either. I&rsquo;ve never seen anything quite like it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama said in the debate that, &quot;George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, one of Bush&rsquo;s first acts as president was to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and other groups working overseas that counsel women about abortion. But as for eliminating Title X funding for health services that Planned Parenthood provides in the United States -- which is what Romney and other Republicans of today favor -- Obama is right. We found no evidence that Bush sought such a change, and Title X funding actually increased during his presidency.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Obama&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em><strong>Editor&#39;s note:</strong> This report has been changed to note that abortion rights advocates refer to the Mexico City policy as &nbsp;&quot;the global gag rule.&quot; Anti-abortion advocates oppose referring to the policy by that term.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-18T17:57:05.620584", "ruling_date": "2012-10-19T13:22:22", "ruling_headline": "Barack Obama says George W.
