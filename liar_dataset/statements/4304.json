But this was far from a consistent trend or even a sharp increase. In the first six months of Walker&rsquo;s administration, the Wisconsin unemployment rate rose more than the U.S. rate only in one month. Moreover, the overall percentage point increase in the state and U.S. rates when compared to January were the same.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Democrats&rsquo; claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
