That&rsquo;s about 9 percent lower than the average national public teacher salary of $56,069, according to the report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVirginia had plenty of company in paying its teachers below the national average. In addition to the Old Dominion, 34 other states had teacher salaries trailing the average, according to the NEA report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVirginia&rsquo;s average pay for teachers ranked 23rd-highest among states. The top average state-wide salary was $72,708 in New York, while the lowest was $35,201 in South Dakota.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo in raw dollars, Virginia&rsquo;s average teacher salary ranks near the middle of states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe amount of money it takes to live comfortably in Virginia is going to be different than what it takes in New York or South Dakota. So we looked at where Virginia ranks in cost of living.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVirginia was the 26th most expensive state to live in during the last quarter of 2010, according to a <a href=\"http://www.missourieconomy.org/indicators/cost_of_living/index.stm\">report </a>by the Missouri Department of Economic Development.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn other words, Virginia ranks in the middle of state both in teacher salaries and cost of living.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe VEA has long argued that Virginia is wealthy and can afford to pay teachers better than most states. Higher salaries, it argues, would help Virginia recruit and retain the best instructors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe looked at Virginia&rsquo;s ability to pay more, turning to data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2010,Virginia&rsquo;s per capita income was $44,762 -- the seventh highest among the states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo it&rsquo;s a logical argument that Virginia has greater ability than most states to pay teachers more. Virginians have higher salaries than most Americans. Their cost of living, meanwhile, ranks in the middle of states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we digress.
