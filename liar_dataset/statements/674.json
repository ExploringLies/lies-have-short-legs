On Aug. 7, 2008, the Alaska Legislature approved a measure she promoted that would send $1,200 to every Alaskan who qualifies.\n</p>\n<p>\n That comes to about $741-million for state residents, out of an estimated $2.7-billion in increased oil taxes and royalties.\n</p>\n<p>\n Purists might argue that the rebates only come to 35 percent of the estimated excess revenue. But still, it seems fair to us to describe a $741-million outlay as \"large,\" and $1,200 per person is a nice windfall.
