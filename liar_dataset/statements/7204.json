Chris Christie isn&rsquo;t quite ready to free the beaches.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs municipalities down the Shore seek financial help in restoring beaches damaged by Hurricane Sandy, two state senators have introduced legislation to prohibit towns that receive federal or state aid from charging beach access fees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Republican governor said in a Dec. 19 radio interview that he still had to evaluate that proposal, and questioned how towns would pay for beach maintenance without charging fees. Those beaches are a key part of tourism at the Shore, which provides $38 billion in economic activity to the state, according to Christie.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I mean, why are we going to rebuild the beach? Because our economy in New Jersey gets $38 billion from the businesses at the Shore,&quot; Christie said on New Jersey 101.5&rsquo;s &quot;Ask the Governor&quot; program. &quot;The Shore ain&rsquo;t the Shore without the beach.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey isn&rsquo;t entering the debate over beach fees, but we did find that Christie is wrong to attribute all of those tourism dollars to Shore businesses. That $38 billion figure applies to New Jersey&rsquo;s entire tourism industry, and the Shore region is only responsible for about half of that amount.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe estimate comes from a study released by state officials in March in regard to the economic impact of the state&rsquo;s tourism industry in 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bulk of the economic activity represents about $37 billion in visitor spending across all of New Jersey&rsquo;s 21 counties on items such as lodging and transportation, according to the study. An additional roughly $1 billion includes other economic impacts, such as capital investment to build hotels and attractions, the study states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf the roughly $37 billion in visitor spending, a total of nearly $19 billion, or slightly more than half, occurred down the Shore in Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic and Cape May counties, according to the study.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe remaining tourism sales were spread across the rest of the state, including about $2.5 billion in Bergen County and nearly $3 billion in Essex County, the study states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor&rsquo;s claim in the radio interview was incorrect, but over the last several months, his administration has accurately cited visitor spending during 2011 in the Shore region. In an Aug. 23 news release, for example, the administration noted how tourism in Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth and Ocean counties &quot;generated approximately $19 billion in visitor revenues.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie spokesman Michael Drewniak didn&rsquo;t question our findings, but argued that the governor has cited that $38 billion figure on other occasions in reference to the entire tourism industry.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Other times, the Governor and Lt. Governor have cited that same figure and spoken of the central importance of our entire state&rsquo;s tourism industry to our economy,&quot; Drewniak said in an e-mail. &quot;They have also noted that the largest slice of tourism dollars is generated by our Shore economy and 127 miles of beaches.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you want to cherry pick this particular utterance, be my guest,&quot; he added.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring an interview on New Jersey 101.5&rsquo;s &quot;Ask the Governor&quot; program, Christie said the beach will be rebuilt because &quot;our economy in New Jersey gets $38 billion from the businesses at the Shore.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that 2011 figure applies to New Jersey&rsquo;s entire tourism industry, from the northwestern stretches of Sussex County to the beaches of Wildwood. Of all visitor spending last year, nearly $19 billion, or slightly more than half, took place down the Shore in Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic and Cape May counties.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/12/politifact_nj_chris_christie_s_8.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-12-28T10:40:53.321129", "ruling_date": "2012-12-30T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie claims Shore businesses provide $38 billion to New Jersey\u2019s economy", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-claims-shore-businesses-provide-38-", "ruling_link_text": "It\u2019s from all NJ tourism", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNew Jersey 101.5, <a href=\"http://nj1015.com/ask-the-governor/\">Ask the Governor</a>, Dec. 19, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2012/dec/09/frank-lautenberg/frank-lautenberg-says-new-jersey-tourism-generates/\">Frank Lautenberg says New Jersey tourism generates billions in the Garden State</a>, Dec. 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism, <a href=\"http://www.visitnj.org/sites/visitnj.org/files/2011-nj-tourism-economic-impact-state-and-counties.pdf\">2011 Tourism Economic Impact Study</a>, accessed Dec. 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism, <a href=\"http://www.visitnj.org/sites/visitnj.org/files/2010-tourism-ecom-impact-prelim-3-23-2011-2.pdf\">2010 Tourism Economic Impact Study</a>, accessed Dec. 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism, <a href=\"http://www.visitnj.org/sites/visitnj.org/files/tourism-ecom-impact-2008.pdf\">2008 Tourism Economic Impact Study</a>, accessed Dec. 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism, <a href=\"http://www.visitnj.org/new-jersey-comeback-continues-increased-tourist-visits-and-near-record-level-visitor-expenditures-20\">New Jersey Comeback Continues with Increased Tourist Visits and Near Record Level of Visitor Expenditures for 2011</a>, March 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Governor&rsquo;s Office, <a href=\"http://nj.gov/governor/news/news/552012/approved/20121123b.html\">Christie Administration Releases Hurricane Sandy Preliminary Damage Assessment</a>, Nov. 23, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Governor&rsquo;s Office, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/governor/news/news/552012/approved/20120823b.html\">Governor Christie Reaffirms Commitment to New Jersey&rsquo;s Healthy Shore and Tourism Economy with Visit to Sea Isle City Boardwalk</a>, Aug. 23, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Governor&rsquo;s Office, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/governor/news/news/552012/approved/20120524e.html\">Governor Christie Launches Memorial Day Weekend Activities in Atlantic City</a>, May 24, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism, <a href=\"http://www.visitnj.org/lt-governor-kim-guadagno-announces-destination-marketing-organization-grants-regional-tourism-promot\">Lt.
