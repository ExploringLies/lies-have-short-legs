Rand Paul, R-Ky., talked about one of his <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/09/rand-paul/rand-paul-debt-has-tripled-bush-took-office/\">favorite dislikes</a>: the national debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You have people in Washington who do things you would never, ever approve of,&quot; said Paul, a Republican presidential candidate, in his July 17, 2015, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7vOJuLrgJM\">remarks</a>. &quot;I&rsquo;ll give you an idea. Does anybody here think it&rsquo;s a good idea to borrow money from China to send it to Pakistan? We borrow a million dollars every minute.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does the country really borrow a million a minute? We decided to check it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To evaluate Paul&rsquo;s claim, we considered the federal deficit -- the difference between the government&rsquo;s revenue intake and spending, which in recent years has been negative. To raise cash to keep the government running under a deficit, the <a href=\"https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/resources/faq/faq_publicdebt.htm#GenInfo\">Treasury</a> has to take on debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvyHuse6buY\">525,600 minutes</a> in a year, so borrowing $1 million a minute would mean the government borrows $525 billion a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal deficit in <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2664.aspx\">fiscal year 2014</a> was $483 billion. The Congressional Budget Office&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-annual-budget-deficit-falls-near-7-year-low-1433959254\">projected deficit</a> for 2015 is $486 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Paul&rsquo;s claim is a little high -- by about $40 billion a year -- but not too far off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, though, it&rsquo;s not as though the country is <a href=\"http://www.usdebtclock.org/\">literally</a> borrowing $1 million every single minute. Though while the national debt is growing overall, the debt accumulates unevenly, in fits and starts, from <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/search?startMonth=01&amp;startDay=01&amp;startYear=2015&amp;endMonth=07&amp;endDay=21&amp;endYear=2015\">day to day</a> as specific bills come due.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s also add some context. While in recent years, the country has borrowed &quot;a million dollars every minute,&quot; this is actually a big improvement from the rate during the Great Recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the same calculation we used earlier, the government borrowed more than $2.6 million a minute in <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/45010-breakout-AppendixH.pdf\">2009</a>, at the height of the recession. That rate has slowed every year since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the million-a-minute number doesn&rsquo;t look so dramatic when you compare it to the fact that the U.S. economy generates about $33 million per minute in income, said Neil Buchanan, an expert in law, economics and the national debt at George Washington University Law School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economists generally agree that debt and deficits are only meaningful as a percentage of a country&#39;s income, rather than as a raw number, Buchanan added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Congressional Budget Office graph below shows the spike in federal budget deficit as a percentage of America&rsquo;s gross domestic product over time. The longest bar (biggest deficit as a percentage of GDP) is 2009 -- at the height of the Great Recession. In the recovery period since, the deficit has declined, but projections show it possibly growing in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ju1N8aOmB6m1xSXse26a9fm4f0VIwhL05Gfbql3Td4wAhk8AZD-kt4yNWydZILNbTajtOBPFpwCzS99xjYAS8aqMyVYSMdVLiXxYOPSv3WK7HuYgRbCCqRvteyWYnEW8ZEdGG1s\" style=\"border:none; height:352px; width:671px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The question should be how fast the debt is growing in relation to GDP. If GDP is growing faster, then the country can service the debt,&quot; said Linda Bilmes, a professor and expert in national budgetary issues at Harvard University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul said, &quot;We borrow a million dollars every minute.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the country to borrow $1 million a minute, the annual government deficit would have to be about $525 billion. In 2014, the deficit was $483 billion, and it&rsquo;s projected to be $486 billion in 2015. So Paul&rsquo;s estimate is a little on the high side. On balance, we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-07-21T13:28:08.525121", "ruling_date": "2015-07-21T14:50:33", "ruling_headline": "Rand Paul: U.S. borrows $1 million a minute", "ruling_headline_slug": "rand-paul-us-borrows-1-million-minute", "ruling_link_text": "Paul rounds up", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>U.S. Treasury, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Debt to the Penny and Who Holds It,</u></a>&quot; July 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Treasury, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/resources/faq/faq_publicdebt.htm#GenInfo\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Frequently Asked Questions about the Public Debt,</u></a>&quot; accessed July 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBO, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/45010-breakout-AppendixH.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Historical Budget Data,</u></a>&quot; February 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBO, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/49892-Outlook2015.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2015 to 2025,</u></a>&quot; January 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/09/rand-paul/rand-paul-debt-has-tripled-bush-took-office/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Rand Paul: Debt doubled under Bush, tripled under Obama,</u></a>&quot; April 9, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Wall Street Journal</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-annual-budget-deficit-falls-near-7-year-low-1433959254\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>U.S. Annual Budget Deficit Smallest in Nearly Seven Years</u></a>,&quot; June 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2015/04/08/fact-checking-rand-pauls-announcement-speech/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Fact checking Rand Paul&rsquo;s announcement speech</u></a>,&quot; April 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breitbart, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/19/rand-paul-rallies-houston-for-real-national-security-we-cant-project-power-from-bankruptcy-court/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Rand Paul Rallies Houston for Real National Security</u></a>,&quot; July 19, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Neil Buchanan, GWU law professor, July 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Linda Bilmes, Harvard professor, July 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Rand spokeswoman Eleanor May, July 21, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 7, "current_job": "Candidate for U.S. Senate and physician", "false_count": 9, "first_name": "Rand", "half_true_count": 12, "home_state": "Kentucky", "id": 744, "last_name": "Paul", "mostly_true_count": 13, "name_slug": "rand-paul", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rand_Paul.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/744/", "total_count": 56, "true_count": 12, "website": "http://www.paul.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;We borrow a million dollars every minute.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign rally in Houston", "statement_date": "2015-07-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 296, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/296/", "subject": "Debt", "subject_slug": "debt", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/47/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 183, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/183/", "subject": "Deficit", "subject_slug": "deficit", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
