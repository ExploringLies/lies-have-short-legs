John Cornyn of Texas has leveled eye-catching charges about the second-term senator, calling Cornyn liberal and also suggesting he&rsquo;s been supportive of the Obamacare law that Cornyn initially voted against in late 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cornyn&rsquo;s campaign spokesman, Drew Brandewie, emailed us this month asking us to look into another claim by U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Friendswood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a Stockman campaign <a href=\"http://stockman2014.com/articles/sleaze-cornyn-gave-reporters-attack-points-to-hammer-cruz\"><u>web page</u></a>, Stockman said Cornyn supported Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in the 2012 Senate election won by Tea Party favorite Ted Cruz, who started the race as a longshot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stockman&rsquo;s words: &quot;And while John Cornyn backed his pal David Dewhurst, I back Ted Cruz.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re not sure how to pin whether Stockman now backs Cruz; the state&#39;s junior senator isn&#39;t on a ballot in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We focused, instead, on whether Cornyn backed Dewhurst over Cruz in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stockman, whom we were unable to reach, did not elaborate on his claim on his website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 2012 race, Dewhurst, lieutenant governor since 2003, was the early favorite as an established statewide officeholder; Cruz hadn&#39;t previously run for office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And along the way there was a hint of grit between Cruz and Cornyn, whom Cruz publicly declined to endorse for a Senate party leadership post. On March 5, 2012, we <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/mar/05/david-dewhurst/ted-cruz-ted-cruz-slurred-republican-senators-incl/\"><u>rated as Half True</u></a> a Dewhurst claim that Cruz had slurred Republican senators including Cornyn as &quot;graybeards&quot; and &quot;spineless jellyfish.&quot; Cruz used those descriptives when talking about Republican candidates, conceivably including senators whom he viewed as insufficiently conservative. Yet it wasn&rsquo;t clear Cruz was referring to Cornyn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Brandewie pointed out news accounts indicating Cornyn was neutral in the race until Cruz won their party&rsquo;s nomination. These included a <a href=\"http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2012/07/live-blog-election-night-coverage-of-texas-senate-runoffs.html/\"><u>news blog post</u></a> by the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> on the night of the Senate runoff July 31, 2012, stating that Cornyn&mdash;&quot;who remained neutral in the race, despite Cruz&rsquo;s reluctance to back him in&hellip; his bid for Senate GOP whip&mdash;praised Cruz for a &lsquo;well-deserved and well-earned victory.&rsquo;&quot; The post quoted Cornyn as saying in a statement: &quot;This has been a hard-fought and spirited primary battle and the people of Texas would have been fortunate to have any one of these well-qualified candidates as their next U.S. senator.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, we spotted a July 27, 2012, <a href=\"http://mo.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/politics/entries/2012/07/27/cornyn_votes_stays_mum_on_cruz.html\"><u>news blog post</u></a> by the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> stating that Cornyn had cast his Senate runoff ballot that morning without announcing a preferred aspirant. The post quoted Cornyn as saying: &quot;I&rsquo;m not picking sides for a very practical reason. I&rsquo;m going to have to work &mdash; it will be my pleasure to work &mdash; with whoever the Republican nominee is. We are looking forward to an ally and reinforcements to help us fight the battle for the free-enterprise system and help turn the country around.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A July 29, 2012, <em>Statesman </em><a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/senate-runoff-turns-on-style-experience-not-poli-1/nRqR6/\"><u>news story</u></a> noted that Cornyn that year was chairing the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which helps Republicans in Senate races. Cornyn, the story said, &quot;has kept mum about his home state race and instead has focused on getting other Republicans elected across the country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no news stories saying Cornyn was backing Dewhurst in the race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stockman said Cornyn supported Dewhurst over Cruz for the U.S. Senate in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence of that. In contrast, news reports say Cornyn revealed no preference before congratulating Cruz for winning the Republican nomination, making Stockman&#39;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>FALSE </em></strong><em>&ndash; The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"> <u>more</u></a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-01-28T15:30:22.140105", "ruling_date": "2014-01-28T14:48:49", "ruling_headline": "John Cornyn was neutral in 2012 U.S. Senate race until Ted Cruz won Republican nomination", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-cornyn-was-neutral-2012-us-senate-race-until-", "ruling_link_text": "Unsupported charge", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qQFiwJmaiwEBNHpesvCYonZVTnhkEZMMOxn0MY_Urpg/pub\"><u>Emails</u></a> (excerpted), Drew Brandewie, communications director, Texans for Sen.
