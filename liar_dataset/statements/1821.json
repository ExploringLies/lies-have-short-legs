Their candidate may be poised to  pull an upset in what is usually a reliably red state.<br /><br />Appearing  on ABC's <em>This Week</em> on May 23, 2010, Democratic National Committee  Chairman Tim Kaine talked up the prospects of Kentucky's Democratic  Attorney General Jack Conway, who won his party's primary May 21.<br /><br />During  a joint interview with Republican National Committee Chairman Michael  Steele, Kaine predicted that Democrats will get a boost from the passage  of major health care reform and an improving economy and will remain in  control of both houses of Congress.<br /><br />\"There's been all this focus on the Rand Paul  race,\" said Kaine, a former Virginia governor, referring to the tea party-backed candidate who won the nomination with 58 percent of the vote. \"The Democratic candidates in that  primary in Kentucky both got more votes than Rand Paul did,\" adding that  Democratic voters are \"energized.\"<br /><br />We wanted to see if Kaine  accurately described the situation in Kentucky, a state generally  considered a Republican stronghold.<br /><br />GOP nominee John McCain  carried Kentucky in 2008 with 57 percent of the vote. And in 2004,  President George W. Bush received nearly 60 percent of the vote. Sen.  Mitch McConnell, the chamber's Republican leader, has held his Kentucky  seat since 1985. The seat Paul and Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson are fighting for is currently  held by Republican Jim Bunning, who is retiring. So the state is solidly red.<br /><br />Yet  Kaine has his numbers right when it comes to last week's primaries.<br /><br />In  the Republican primary, Paul -- the son of 2008 presidential candidate  Ron Paul -- received almost 207,000 votes, easily defeating McConnell's  preferred candidate, Grayson.<br /><br />Conway,  meanwhile, received almost 229,000 votes in the Democratic primary.  Second-place finisher Lt. Gov. Daniel Mongiardo received 225,000 votes.<br /><br />Overall,  almost 170,000 more people voted in the Democratic primary than the  Republican primary, according to the state's board of elections. But  does that automatically translate to additional momentum for Democrats  come fall?<br /><br />Hardly.<br /><br />According to voter registration  figures, Democrats outnumber Republicans 1.6 million to 1 million, which  easily explains much of the disparity. And while the voter edge may  show in primaries, many of those Democrats end up voting for Republicans  in the general election. <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/2010/05/08/1256836/kentucky-poll-many-democrats-undecided.html#ixzz0omq5iTJ1\" target=\"_blank\">A  recent poll in Kentucky</a>, for instance, found that less than half of  Kentucky Democrats have a negative opinion of the tea party, according  to the <em>Lexington Herald-Leader.</em> \"I thought that would be much higher,\"  said Del Ali, president of Research 2000, which conducted the poll. \"I  would guess that if we polled other states heavy in Democratic  registration like Kentucky, the attitude toward the tea party would be  more unfavorable than 46 percent among Democrats.\"<br /><br />In 2008,  600,000 Democrats voted in the U.S. Senate primary compared to less than  200,000 Republicans voting in the GOP primary. But McConnell, a  Republican, still got re-elected in the general election.<br /><br />It was  the same story in 1998, the last time Kentucky had an open U.S. Senate  seat. That year, Democrats had a six-way race, with three candidates  receiving more than 155,000 votes. Compare that to a two-person GOP  primary, where winner Bunning got only 152,000 votes overall. Bunning,  of course, went on to win in November.<br /><br />In trying to play up  Democrats' chances in Kentucky this fall, Democratic National Committee  Chairman Tim Kaine had his numbers right about the Democratic primary,  but his underlying point was a stretch. Those primary vote totals really  aren't an indication of strong prospects for the Democratic candidate  Conway, or conversely, less support for Paul. So we find his claim Half  True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-05-23T13:59:53.826279", "ruling_date": "2010-05-23T18:16:09", "ruling_headline": "Kentucky Democrats got more votes than Republican Rand Paul, DNC chair says", "ruling_headline_slug": "kentucky-democrats-got-more-votes-republican-rand-", "ruling_link_text": "Result of registration advantage, not necessarily groundswell", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Congressional Quarterly, transcript of This Week, May 23, 2010 <br /><br />Kentucky State Board of Elections, <a href=\"http://www.elect.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/9B962D0A-E25D-43DE-8DE6-8603346E3433/227147/statcnty.txt\" target=\"_blank\">voter registration statistics</a>, May 18, 2010<br /><br />Kentucky State Board of Elections, <a href=\"http://www.elect.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/46AE3F8B-88D5-4807-8110-DC3023585DF4/152039/STATE2.txt\" target=\"_blank\">2008 U.S. Senate primary results</a>, June 11, 2008<br /><br />Kentucky State Board of Elections, <a href=\"http://www.elect.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/1283C01A-3F26-4821-8336-5878446F15E4/173402/STATE.TXT\" target=\"_blank\">2008 U.S. Senate general election results</a>, Nov. 26, 2008<br /><br />Kentucky State Board of Elections, <a href=\"http://www.elect.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8A101B6D-0DD6-4730-9524-10CDED792DCC/0/USSenate.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">1998 U.S. Senate primary results</a><br /><br />Kentucky State Board of Elections, <a href=\"http://www.elect.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/F18F5DA0-5B11-42DA-8878-394A70CEF18F/5951/res_ussenate.txt\" target=\"_blank\">1998 U.S. Senate general election results</a></p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Tim", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 424, "last_name": "Kaine", "mostly_true_count": 15, "name_slug": "tim-kaine", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AP_NCCB111_CAMPAIGN_2016_KA.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/424/", "total_count": 57, "true_count": 12, "website": "http://www.kaine.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>The primary election results show Democrats are strong in Kentucky  because the Democratic candidates \"both got more votes than Rand Paul  did.\"</p>", "statement_context": "an interview on ABC's 'This Week.'", "statement_date": "2010-05-23", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 151, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/151/", "subject": "This Week - ABC News", "subject_slug": "abc-news-week", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
