He also brought attention to President Barack Obama&rsquo;s deportation record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it. Nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They&#39;ve been deported,&quot; Trump <a href=\"https://medium.com/@PolitiFact/politifacts-annotated-transcript-of-the-third-presidential-debate-f9655566fb37#.qg78ahpa3\">said</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deportations and what to do with millions of people in the country illegally are highly controversial topics. Trump himself <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/04/mike-pence/pence-says-trump-has-been-consistent-immigration-v/\">has not</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/aug/30/what-donald-trump-has-said-about-deporting-undocum/\">stuck to one</a> approach about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt many people have been deported under Obama&rsquo;s presidency --- but we were curious about Trump&rsquo;s claim of &quot;millions&quot; and on lack of information about it, &quot;nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s known about deportation numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security issues <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/yearbook-immigration-statistics\">yearly statistics</a> on enforcement actions. The latest available is for <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/yearbook-immigration-statistics-2014-enforcement-actions\">fiscal year 2014</a>, which is Oct. 1, 2013, to Sept. 30, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From fiscal years 2009 to 2014, there have been more than 2.4 million removals, according to DHS data. Fiscal year 2009 includes data for a few months in which Obama was not in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, if we add just the full fiscal years in which he has been office, and for which data is available (2010-2014), there have been over 2 million removals. That corroborates Trump&rsquo;s claim that &quot;under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also issues <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/removal-statistics\">removal data</a>. But its removal totals equals the sum of two actions: &quot;removals&quot; and &quot;returns.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Removals account for people moved out of the country based on a formal order from a judge. Returns track people who were encountered by ICE, but who chose to depart the United States prior to a resolution of their immigration case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even then, ICE data shows that more than 2 million people have been moved out of the country while Obama has been in office, supporting part of Trump&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the debate, however, Trump also claimed these millions of deportations have not been spoken about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/data-dive/2015/02/25/tracking-obamas-deportation-numbers/\">there</a> <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/252637/obama-has-deported-more-immigrants-than-any-other-president-now-hes-running-up-the-score/\">is</a> <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obamas-deportation-policy-numbers/story?id=41715661\">extensive</a> <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obama-deported-record-number-immigrants-trump-claim-article-1.2774180\">reporting</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/10/american-principles-action/has-barack-obama-deported-more-people-any-other-pr/\">that</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/17/janet-murguia/activist-janet-murguia-calls-obama-deporter-chief-/\">shows</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/us/politics/deportation-policy-shift-is-signaled-by-obama.html?hpw&amp;rref=politics&amp;_r=0\">otherwise</a>. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/08/us/us-deports-record-number-of-foreigners-in-2011.html\">For years</a>, news outlets have reported on Obama&rsquo;s deportation numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some examples:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2010</strong>: <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/25/AR2010072501790.html\">reported</a> that &quot;the Obama administration is deporting record numbers of illegal immigrants.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2012</strong>: NPR <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2012/12/24/167970002/obama-administration-deported-record-1-5-million-people\">reported</a> that the Obama administration &quot;deported a record 1.5 million&quot; in his first term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2014</strong>: An&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/us/more-deportations-follow-minor-crimes-data-shows.html\">analysis</a>&nbsp;by <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;found that since Obama became president, &quot;two-thirds of the nearly two million deportation cases involve people who had committed minor infractions, including traffic violations, or had no criminal record at all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2016</strong>: <em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/us/low-priority-immigrants-still-swept-up-in-net-of-deportation.html\">reported</a> in June that Obama &quot;has carried out many more deportations than previous presidents, setting a record of more than 2.4 million formal removals.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even immigration advocates have called out Obama for his deportation record, challenging his <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/288/provide-a-path-to-citizenship-for-undocumented-imm/\">campaign promise</a> to provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama was dubbed the &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNHWvqIjk9M\">Deporter-in-Chief</a>&quot; in 2014 by Janet Murgu&iacute;a, president of the National Council of La Raza, an immigrant advocacy group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For the president, I think his legacy is at stake here,&quot; Murgu&iacute;a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/national-council-of-la-raza-janet-murguia-barack-obama-deporter-in-chief-immigration-104217#ixzz4NevjS8qj \">told Politico</a> in March 2014. &quot;We consider him the deportation president, or the deporter-in-chief.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We pointed out the Politico article to Trump&rsquo;s campaign and a spokesperson said, &quot;That was published over two&nbsp;years ago.&quot; But Trump&rsquo;s claim at the debate did not specify that deportations under Obama are not currently being talked about -- which would still be an inaccurate statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama addressed the &quot;Deporter-In-Chief&quot; moniker in a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/news/the-fix/wp/2014/12/10/watch-president-obama-get-a-little-testy-over-his-immigration-record/?outputType=accessibility&amp;nid=menu_nav_accessibilityforscreenreader\">2014 interview</a> with Jorge Ramos, a Fusion and Univision anchor. Ramos told him 2 million deportations under his presidency had destroyed families and that he was called &quot;Deporter-in-Chief.&quot; Obama said it was &quot;not true&quot; when Ramos said he could&rsquo;ve stopped deportations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There certainly has been a lot of folks who have focused on Obama&rsquo;s deportation record,&quot; said William Stock, an immigration lawyer and president of the <a href=\"http://www.aila.org/\">American Immigration Lawyers Association</a>. &quot;No one can argue that not only have there been hundreds of thousands of removals each year, but there have also been a lot of people talking about those removals.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of deportations under Obama have been raised by the press, advocacy groups and even at <a href=\"http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2016/5/sessions-delivers-opening-statement-on-declining-deportations-and-increasing-criminal-alien-releases\">congressional</a> <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?327240-1/hearing-immigration-enforcement\">hearings</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;Sen.

But Trump&rsquo;s claim that &quot;nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it,&quot; is completely wrong. Not only is federal data issued about it on a yearly basis, there has also been extensive media coverage about it. Immigration advocates have called out the president for it and congressional hearings on deportations have also taken place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s claim is partly right.
