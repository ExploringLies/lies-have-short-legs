So we wanted to see if Putnam had his fish regulations right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, a group controlled by the governor, approves fishing rules for the state. The commission has rules in place for the fishing of redfish, which are also called red drum fish or red bass.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://myfwc.com/fishing/saltwater/regulations/red-drum/\" id=\"fe1s\" title=\"Putnam has the rules right\">Putnam has it right</a>. Fishermen can only harvest (or keep) redfish that are at least 18 inches long, but no more than 27 inches long. Fishermen can keep only one redfish each day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe rules are in place to prevent the overfishing of redfish. The maximum is in place specifically to protect spawning redfish.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you&#39;re following this, that means that Scott -- based on what he told reporters -- broke the fishing rules. But the Governor&#39;s Office later told Orlando&#39;s WESH-TV that Scott misspoke. Each angler brought back one fish, and Scott&#39;s 40-inch monster was tossed back into the Gulf of Mexico, a spokesman said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd that means Putnam was right when he said he couldn&#39;t keep his 42-inch redfish because state fishing rules prohibit it.
