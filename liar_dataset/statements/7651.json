Right now, federal background checks are only required for sales through licensed gun dealers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s how background checks work.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe FBI maintains the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen you buy a gun from a federally licensed dealer, you <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov/files/forms/download/atf-f-4473-1.pdf\">fill out a form</a> with personally identifying information. The dealer uses the NICS to match that information with various records to make sure you&rsquo;re not, for example, a felon who&rsquo;s not allowed to own a weapon. It&rsquo;s a computerized process that&rsquo;s only supposed to take about <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/general-information/fact-sheet\">30 seconds</a>, but in the case of an unclear match, can take up to three days.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you&rsquo;re cleared to purchase a gun, the government is <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/general-information/fact-sheet\">required to destroy</a> all identifying information about you before the next business day. Instead, the dealer is required to store the form.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s right: Federal law requires <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-44\">destruction of records</a> and <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/926?quicktabs_8=1#quicktabs-8\">bans creation</a> of a federal gun registry.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDoes S. 649, sponsored by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., change that?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSeveral attorneys we spoke to said no, it didn&rsquo;t &mdash; it leaves those provisions in place. More people would be subject to background checks, but a federal database of that information would remain as illegal as ever.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, says the language of the bill leaves a door open for a new kind of record of sales between private sellers &mdash; as opposed to sales by federally licensed gun dealers &mdash; a record that may not be subject to the registry ban.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;We have a real fear with this particular legislative language that this would result in new records being created,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe points to a legal phrase in the bill &mdash; &quot;notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter&quot; &mdash; as perhaps allowing creation and, later, collection of those records, even though existing law rules out &quot;a system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, even if there&rsquo;s no intent to create such a loophole in the registry ban, the law doesn&rsquo;t explicitly rule it out, he argues.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCall it the possibility of a partial registry.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a crazy idea to say that if the records exist, there would be a push to use them for other things,&quot; &nbsp;Calabrese said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe contrasts the bill&rsquo;s vague language with <a href=\"http://www.toomey.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=968\">an amendment</a> proposed by Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that would explicitly bar any such registry and adds the possibility of up to 15 years in prison for violators.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut even if the federal government created a new type of record for gun sales between private sellers &mdash; and tracked them &mdash; that wouldn&rsquo;t be &quot;universal registration of all firearms and their owners,&quot; as suggested by the Arizona group&rsquo;s email message.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;There are at least 300 million guns in private ownership in America today, and I am not aware of any provision of S. 649 that would require the registration of those guns or assist the federal government in determining precisely who owns them,&quot; said Clark Neily, who was co-counsel to Dick Heller in <em><a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZO.html\">District of Columbia vs. Heller</a></em>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(Still, he said, mentioning the ACLU&rsquo;s worry, the Arizona email &quot;touches upon a genuine concern.&quot;)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo what does the Arizona Citizens Defense League say about its claim that the bill &quot;is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners&quot;?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEssentially, that the government will violate its own rules against keeping background check records.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;This is where background knowledge of the issue is so important, and goes WAY beyond what is written in statute,&quot; said Charles Heller, a radio host and spokesperson for the Arizona Citizens Defense League. (He&rsquo;s no relation to Dick Heller.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe says the FBI&rsquo;s NICS system could illegally store results of all background checks.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;This is simply a method to herd all transfers to being &lsquo;on record,&rsquo; for later confiscation,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the email message didn&rsquo;t say the law would make it easier for the federal government to create an illegal gun registry. It said:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;The true subject of S. 649 is the requirement to report all firearms transfers to the federal government via &lsquo;universal background checks.&rsquo; In reality S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners. As history has repeatedly shown us, and is currently being demonstrated in New York, registration is the prelude to confiscation.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s simply not what the bill proposes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRobert Levy, the chairman of the board of directors of the libertarian Cato Institute, was <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/reflections-gun-control-second-amendment-advocate\">in his own words</a>, &quot;a vigorous advocate for the right to possess firearms for self-defense&quot; as co-counsel to Dick Heller in <em>District of Columbia vs. Heller</em>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe acknowledges the concern that expanding background checks creates a data trail that Americans must trust is being destroyed in a timely way by the federal government.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStill, he says, &quot;it&#39;s incorrect to assert that S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn email circulated to Arizona residents claims a bill before the Senate &quot;is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners.&quot; The bill expands background checks to most gun transfers. But federal rules forbid the government from keeping a record of successful background checks for more than a day. The ACLU argues it&rsquo;s possible the bill creates a new type of record for some sales that may not be subject to the ban, but that&rsquo;s not the same thing as &quot;universal registration of all firearms and their owners.&quot; We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-04-15T16:29:47.010108", "ruling_date": "2013-04-16T10:25:18", "ruling_headline": "Gun-rights group says Senate bill proposes \u2018universal registration of all firearms and their owners\u2019", "ruling_headline_slug": "gun-rights-group-says-senate-bill-proposes-univers", "ruling_link_text": "Universal registry still illegal", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tArizona Citizens Defense League, email with subject line &quot;Stop Federal Universal Firearms Registration!&quot; April 10, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEmail interview with Charles Heller, spokesperson, Arizona Citizens Defense League, host and producer, Liberty Watch Radio, April 12, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEmail interview with Larry Rosenthal, Chapman University School of Law, April 12, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with Adam Winkler, professor, University of California at Los Angeles School of Law, April 12, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEmail interview with Clark Neily, senior attorney, Institute for Justice, April 12, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEmail interview with Robert Levy, chairman, Cato Institute, April 12, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel, American Civil Liberties Union, April 15, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCornell University Law School, <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZO.html\"><em>District of Columbia vs. Heller</em>, Justice Scalia, Opinion of the Court</a>, accessed April 12, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLibrary of Congress&#39; Thomas, &quot;<a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:s.649:\">Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013</a>,&quot; March 21, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSen.
