John McCain's campaign portrays Sen. Barack Obama as an opponent of electric cars, nuclear power and energy \"innovation.\"\n<p>\n With music that sounds like the 007 theme, the ad opens with Obama in silhouette and the words \"Barack Obama Is Dr. No.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n The words change to \"No To Drilling Offshore Oil\" while Obama is heard saying, \"Offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n The screen says, \"No To A Gas Tax Holiday\" while Obama says, \"I think John McCain's proposal for a three-month tax holiday is a bad idea.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n \"No To Innovation. No To The Electric Car\" then appears, while Obama says \"In this campaign, John McCain is offering the same old gimmicks.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n The screen says \"No To Clean, Safe, Nuclear Energy\" while Obama says \"I start off with the premise that nuclear energy is not optimal. I am not a nuclear energy proponent.\" The ad ends with the message: \"Barack Obama Truly Is The Dr. No Of Energy Security.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n The ad is part of an effort by the McCain campaign to portray Obama as an obstructionist on energy policy. The ad has a kind of split personality. While the drilling and gas tax claims were accurate, as we explain\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/546/\">\n  in this item,\n </a>\n the other claims were strikingly wrong.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this item, we'll examine the claims about electric cars, nuclear power and innovation.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let's take electric cars first. To back this up, the McCain campaign cites Obama's statement that McCain's $300-million prize for improving car batteries was \"a gimmick.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n But that doesn't prove Obama said \"no\" to electric cars. (As our friends at FactCheck.org\n <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/distorting_obama.html\">\n  have pointed out,\n </a>\n the McCain campaign ignored an Obama remark in which he was criticizing McCain for\n <i>\n  not doing more\n </i>\n than the battery prize.)\n</p>\n<p>\n In fact, Obama has said his energy plan will lead to more electric cars. In a speech on June 16, Obama said his proposal to invest $150-billion in energy programs would lead to new jobs \"that will be created when plug-in hybrids or electric cars start rolling off the assembly line here in Michigan.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n In a speech on May 14, he praised Chrysler for \"working to develop a system that integrates electric motors with a fixed-gear transmission.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n That doesn't sound like \"no\" to us.\n</p>\n<p>\n Against innovation? To back that up, the McCain campaign cites the same line that McCain's battery plan was a gimmick.\n</p>\n<p>\n But Obama last October proposed a decade-long, $150-billion energy program that would increase research and create new jobs developing \"climate-friendly energy supplies that will move us toward energy independence.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n An 11-page account of his plan, titled\n <i>\n  Barack Obama's Plan to Make America a Global Energy Leader,\n </i>\n includes incentives for communities to invest in biofuels refineries, more emphasis on clean coal and \"safe and secure nuclear energy.\" That sounds to us like a pretty significant attempt at innovation.\n</p>\n<p>\n Which brings us to the McCain ad's last point, that Obama said \"No To Clean, Safe, Nuclear Energy.\" To the contrary, it's right there on page 4 of Obama's energy plan: \"Safe and Secure Nuclear Energy.\" It's not a blanket endorsement &mdash; Obama says it's important to protect the security of nuclear fuel and waste and determine how to store the waste &mdash; but it's still a part of his plan.\n</p>\n<p>\n So McCain is way, way off with these charges. It's not that he's just missing nuances or exaggerating; he has completely distorted Obama's positions, falsely claiming that Obama opposes research and innovation on the most significant political issue of the summer.\n</p>\n<p>\n He portrays Obama as a impediment to energy research when the Democratic candidate has been at least as assertive on the issue as McCain has &mdash; and has been touting his energy plan since last October. It's so wrong we have to set the meter ablaze: Pants on Fire.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:12.110657", "ruling_date": "2008-06-27T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "This 007 claim is out of ammo", "ruling_headline_slug": "this-007-claim-is-out-of-ammo", "ruling_link_text": "This 007 claim is out of ammo", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "FactCheck.org,\n<a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/distorting_obama.html\">\n Distorting Obama,\n</a>\nJune 26, 2008\n<p>\n Obama campaign,\n <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/2008/06/16/remarks_of_senator_barack_obam_79.php\">\n  Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: Renewing American Competitiveness,\n </a>\n Flint, Mich., June 16, 2008\n</p>\n<p>\n Obama campaign,\n <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/2008/05/14/remarks_of_senator_barack_obam_66.php\">\n  Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: Macomb Community College,\n </a>\n May 14, 2008\n</p>\n<p>\n Obama campaign,\n <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/issues/pdf/EnergyFactSheet.pdf\">\n  Barack Obama's Plan to Make America a Global Energy Leader\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 32, "current_job": "U.S. senator", "false_count": 39, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 31, "home_state": "Arizona", "id": 8, "last_name": "McCain", "mostly_true_count": 37, "name_slug": "john-mccain", "pants_count": 8, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-johnmccain.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Arizona", "edition": "Arizona", "edition_slug": "arizona", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 56, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Arizona Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/56/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/8/", "total_count": 190, "true_count": 37, "website": "http://www.johnmccain.com/"}, "statement": "Says Obama opposes innovation, the electric car and \"clean, safe, nuclear energy.\"\r\n", "statement_context": "a Web ad", "statement_date": "2008-06-25", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
