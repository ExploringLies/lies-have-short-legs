Bob Donovan harbors no illusions of a cakewalk to the mayor&rsquo;s office in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The well-funded and entrenched incumbent, Tom Barrett, appears poised to seek a fourth four-year term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And history&rsquo;s not on Donovan&rsquo;s side, the alderman told supporters July 29, 2014, when he announced his bid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What we are proposing is monumental and also unprecedented,&quot; Donovan said. &quot;As a matter of fact to the best of my knowledge there has never been an alderman who has defeated an incumbent mayor in the history of this great city.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee&rsquo;s modern-day tendency to return incumbents to office is well documented: it&rsquo;s been almost 75 years since a mayor fell (Carl Zeidler stunned Daniel Hoan in 1940).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But never&rsquo;s a long time. No alderman has ever dethroned a mayor?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>To the history books</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We took up Donovan&rsquo;s history challenge, looking back to the early days of city government, when aldermen <a href=\"http://city.milwaukee.gov/TheHistoryofMilwauke2706.htm#.U-ANvfldXTo\">received no salary and worked out of a church </a>and above a livery stable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee has elected a &quot;boy mayor&quot; (flashy 29-year-old Sherburn Becker, 1906). It has backed &nbsp;mayors born in Germany, Ireland and France. It voted in a mayor (Zeidler) whose surprising win was engineered by the future writer of &quot;Psycho.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city&rsquo;s voters have made a mayor of the man who wrote the &quot;Peck&rsquo;s Bad Boy&quot; books (George W. Peck), and have tapped surgeons, liquor peddlers, judges, congressman, bankers and many lawyers to the post. Democrats are the rule, but a few Republicans have broken through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But relatively few aldermen even have run against an incumbent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last to try, unsuccessfully, was Rod Lanser in the 1968 primary. Mayor Henry Maier won a third term and served until 1988.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last to win a mayor&rsquo;s race as an alderman: Emil Seidel (1910), owner of a small pattern shop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seidel is remembered not for that, but for starting the city&rsquo;s half-century of mainly Socialist Party mayors. He made a national splash, becoming the first Socialist to run a major U.S. city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Seidel didn&rsquo;t defeat a sitting mayor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He tried, but in 1908 lost narrowly to David S. Rose, described by historian John Gurda as &quot;a political prince of darkness who allowed prostitution, gambling dens, all-night saloons and influence-peddling to flourish on his watch&quot; while fighting off criminal charges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rose wasn&rsquo;t re-nominated by the Democrats in 1910, and Seidel defeated Republican physician John Beffel (&quot;Dr. Good Government&quot;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like Donovan, Seidel was fond of meeting constituents in taverns. so much so that &quot;Seidel&quot; became a nickname for a beer mug, Martin Hintz recounts in &quot;A Spirited History of Milwaukee Brews &amp; Booze.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back to Donovan&rsquo;s claim that since the city charter was signed in 1846, no alderman has defeated a sitting mayor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Echoing Donovan, to the best of our knowledge, he is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We examined newspaper archives and the Milwaukee Public Library&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://content.mpl.org/cdm/search/collection/MilwMayors\">&quot;Milwaukee Mayors&quot;</a> digital collection. We consulted with the city&rsquo;s Legislative Reference Bureau&rsquo;s library manager, Eileen Lipinski, Gurda and Milwaukee City Clerk Jim Owczarski. &nbsp;We reviewed races up to the present day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only a handful of aldermen or former aldermen have advanced to the mayor&rsquo;s office, and none against an incumbent, Lipinski found after combing through records kept by the non-partisan research agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A tough challenge</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes the leap from alderman to mayor so tough? After all, there&rsquo;s only a couple hundred feet separating their second-floor offices in Milwaukee&rsquo;s 119-year-old City Hall downtown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Most alderman are very familiar to voters in their districts,&quot; offered Donovan. &quot;But not citywide.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s also a general fear among alderman about taking on any sitting mayor, for fear of losing and suffering retribution in terms of help for their districts, Donovan said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m not accusing the mayor,&quot; said Donovan, who intends to run for both mayor and his district seat simultaneously. &quot;That&rsquo;s always a concern of aldermen. We&rsquo;re only as good as what we can deliver.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donovan might not find as much comfort from Seidel&rsquo;s example if he digs into the deep background on the Socialist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seidel, we found, was elected in 1908 as an &quot;alderman at large,&quot; which meant he had a citywide constituency, rather than representing a smaller geographical area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No Milwaukee alderman has defeated an incumbent to become mayor, according to Donovan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s relatively rare for aldermen or former aldermen to run for mayor. It&rsquo;s even more rare for them to win. And none has ever bested a sitting mayor, experts agree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Donovan&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-05T14:32:59.119872", "ruling_date": "2014-08-06T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Bob Donovan wants to go where no alderman has gone before", "ruling_headline_slug": "bob-donovan-wants-to-go-where-no-alderman-has-gone", "ruling_link_text": "He\u2019ll have to make history to be His Honor", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview with Bob Donovan, Aug. 5, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Eileen Lipinski, library manager, Milwaukee Legislative Reference Bureau, Aug. 4, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with John Gurda, July 31, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Milwaukee City Clerk Jim Owczarski, Aug. 4, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Public Library&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://content.mpl.org/cdm/search/collection/MilwMayors\">&quot;MIlwaukee Mayors&quot; </a>collection</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Historical Society, <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-043/\">&quot;Milwaukee Sewer Socialism&quot;</a> collection</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Making of Milwaukee,&quot; by John Gurda</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A Spirited History of Milwaukee Brews &amp; Booze.&quot; by Martin Hintz</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Sentinel archives</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Member of Milwaukee Common Council", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Bob", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 832, "last_name": "Donovan", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "bob-donovan", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Bob_Donovan.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/832/", "total_count": 5, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://city.milwaukee.gov/district8"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;There has never been an alderman who has defeated an incumbent mayor in the history of this great city.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech", "statement_date": "2014-07-29", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
