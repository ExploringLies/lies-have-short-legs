Could your unsuspecting roommates face a felony?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe bill, known as the <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:s.649:\">Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013</a>, faces votes on a series of amendments, most prominently <a href=\"http://www.toomey.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=968\">one </a><a href=\"http://www.toomey.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=968\">proposed</a> by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo all bets are off on the bill&rsquo;s final language.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStill, as the debate unfolds, we were curious: Does Senate Bill 649 make felons of vacationing gun owners with roommates or house guests?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Gun transfers</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs introduced in the Senate in March, <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:s.649:\">S. 649</a> requires background checks for all gun sales, with a limited set of exceptions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd it&rsquo;s not just sales that are subject to the law &mdash; but gun &quot;transfers.&quot; In general, it would be illegal to give your gun to someone else without seeking a federal background check.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut there are a series of exceptions that seek to loosen the requirement in some situations &mdash; for example, handing your gun to a friend at a shooting range or while hunting legally together, giving a gun as a gift to a close relative or leaving a gun in a will.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s also okay under the bill to lend your gun to someone in your own home or yard &mdash; as long as that &quot;temporary transfer&quot; lasts less than seven days.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThus, the issue raised by the Arizona Citizens Defense League.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;While the proposed legislation contains limited exceptions for transfers such as between family members,&quot; says the email, sent to supporters April 10, &quot;a little digging shows that you would be committing a federal felony if you ... &nbsp;leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, what happens if a buddy house-sits or a roommate stays home during your eight-day vacation?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe answer: It would likely depend on the circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;I would say it should be changed to &lsquo;you <em>might</em> be committing a federal felony if you leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms,&rsquo;&quot; said Clark Neily, who helped represent security guard Dick Heller in his <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZO.html\">successful Supreme Court challenge</a> to D.C.&rsquo;s handgun ban.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you locked up your guns and expressly forbade others from using them, you would have a pretty good argument that you hadn&rsquo;t transferred possession, attorneys told us.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut say your weapons were available to guests or roommates &mdash; that nothing would prevent them from using your guns while you were out of town. Then you might have a problem.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe federal government tends to have an expansive definition of &quot;possession,&quot; under various laws, Neily said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;I would say there is a real possibility that someone could be convicted under S. 649 for leaving town for more than seven days while someone else is at home with their guns,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStill, a house guest&rsquo;s mere &quot;access&quot; to your weapons wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily qualify as possession, said Larry Rosenthal, a law professor at Chapman University School of Law who has worked as a federal prosecutor and argued before the Supreme Court as an attorney for the City of Chicago.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe pointed to a 2012 case decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals&rsquo; Seventh Circuit,<em> <a href=\"http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2012/D07-05/C:11-1951:J:Hamilton:aut:T:fnOp:N:951998:S:0\">United States vs. Griffin</a></em>, in which a felon had been convicted of illegally possessing firearms and ammunition because he lived with his dad, who had hunting gear around the house.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe court overturned the conviction, explaining the government&rsquo;s argument &quot;confuses access with possession,&quot; Rosenthal said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMeanwhile, just staying in a home with weapons &mdash; especially if the house-sitter or roommate didn&rsquo;t know they were there &mdash; wouldn&rsquo;t plausibly qualify as a &quot;transfer&quot; of a firearm, Rosenthal said. There would have to be a &quot;knowing passage of control.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo leaving your roommate home alone for weeks, oblivious to the shotgun under your bed, likely wouldn&rsquo;t violate the bill&rsquo;s provisions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAn Arizona group says a gun bill before the Senate would make it a federal felony to &quot;leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIndeed, S. 649, as introduced in the Senate, allows for &quot;temporary transfers&quot; of guns in your own home that last less than seven days. But leaving a house-sitter or roommate with access to weapons while you&rsquo;re away for a longer stretch, attorneys explained to PolitiFact, could raise the possibility of violating federal law under the bill&rsquo;s provisions. Still, experts told us a gun owner might avoid such a consequence by locking up weapons and denying permission to use them. And it&rsquo;s not clear courts would interpret mere access as a transfer of possession.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe claim is just partially accurate.
