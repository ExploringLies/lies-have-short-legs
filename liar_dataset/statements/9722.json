While the State Department facilitated the paperwork for the medical evacuations, these people arrived in a private chartered jet paid for by the religious charities they worked for, Serving in Mission and Samaritan&rsquo;s Purse. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/us/nancy-writebol-kent-brantly-ebola-atlanta.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>At a news conference</u></a>, Bruce Johnson, the president of Serving in Mission USA, said his group has spent about $1 million on the two patients since their illness was discovered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, and&nbsp;more important for this fact-check, is what the executive order says. It&#39;s much more&nbsp;targeted than the article describes, it isn&rsquo;t aimed at Ebola, and while it allows health officials to quarantine someone with a highly contagious disease, it does not mandate&nbsp;it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On July 31, Obama modified a <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/sars/quarantine/exec-2004-04-03.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;\"><u>2003 executive order from President George W. Bush</u></a>. The original listed the communicable diseases for which the Department of Health and Human Services was authorized to issue an isolation or quarantine order. Bush specifically mentioned Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a disease associated with &quot;fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama updated the particular reference to SARS to include a broader array of possible respiratory illnesses.<strong> </strong>The new text reads as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;Severe acute respiratory syndromes, which are diseases that are associated with fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness, are capable of being transmitted from person to person, and that either are causing, or have the potential to cause, a pandemic, or, upon infection, are highly likely to cause mortality or serious morbidity if not properly controlled. This subsection does not apply to influenza.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be clear, the update has nothing to do with Ebola or the current outbreak. Ebola is not a respiratory disease (the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/symptoms/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>most prominent signs are diarrhea and vomiting</u></a>) and the original 2003 executive order already listed Ebola.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House press office told PunditFact that the change was aimed at <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/faq.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome </u></a>(MERS), an illness with symptoms that do match the updated executive order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More critically for our examination, the updated order does not &quot;mandate&quot; the<strong> </strong>apprehension and detention of people who show signs of respiratory illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wendy Parmet, a law professor at Northeastern University School of Law, is one of three legal scholars who prepared a report for the <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/privacy/pemic_report.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>American Civil Liberties Union</u></a> that warned about overreach by the government in responding to pandemics. While Parmet said the new text is very broad, it has clear limits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It only applies to those with symptoms of a disease that have caused or have the potential to cause a pandemic, or have the potential of causing mortality or serious morbidity,&quot; Parmet said. &quot;I wouldn&rsquo;t think the typical cold would apply.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the order specifically excludes the flu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What happens if you do have Ebola, or MERS, or one of the other afflictions specified in the executive order?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/264\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Title 42 United States Code Section 264</u></a> gives the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to isolate an infected person.

Its authority is limited to people as they enter the country or attempt to travel from one one state to another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other scenarios, the power to isolate or quarantine individuals rests with the states, Parmet said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Infowars.com said Obama&rsquo;s latest executive order &quot;mandates the apprehension and detention of Americans who merely show signs of &lsquo;respiratory illness.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a fundamental misreading of the executive order Obama signed and the power the federal government has.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The updates Obama made to a 2003 executive order do not mandate the apprehension and detention of people who show signs of &quot;respiratory illness,&quot;
