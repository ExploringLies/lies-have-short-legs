Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it&#39;ll happen and it&#39;ll happen fast.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the fourth time we&rsquo;ve weighed in on a statement from Trump about America&rsquo;s tax rate. The difference tonight is the slightly tempered tone. Instead of declaring the United States as having the highest tax rate, he said we&rsquo;re one of the highest-taxed countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s progress. But it&rsquo;s still not 100 percent accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in May, Trump said, &quot;We&rsquo;re the highest-taxed nation in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-us-not-highest-taxed-nation-in-world/\">False</a> because, according to the Pew Research Center last year, America is slightly <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/11/among-developed-nations-americans-tax-bills-are-below-average/\">behind the middle of the pack</a> when it comes to the taxed revenue portion of gross domestic product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"Pew tax comparable.JPG\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/a0UmL2hl-E1gj8CB6nIXae7TZ3ItH1H77ETAhdvlWWCztgPzn5rM4Zm061R75KDF9dqt7IPMBMXQ5XiuYZD8mUTGuPqR0jEcsvFHiBPyLnw3WaVZZZ3civfk6virlJWii8MuFkGF\" style=\"height:389px; width:624px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raj Shah, a Republican National Committee spokesman, told PolitiFact that Trump was talking about the <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/corporate-income-tax-rates-around-world-2015\">corporate tax rate</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump didn&rsquo;t specify that distinction in his speech, though his tax-rate claim was immediately followed by the business-specific line about reducing taxes that will spur growth of new companies and jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve previously <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/09/eric-bolling/does-us-have-highest-corporate-tax-rate-free-world/\">fact-checked </a>a statement about whether the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world, and found it pretty accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the most advanced and industrialized nations in the world, America ranks <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/corporate-income-tax-rates-around-world-2015\">third highest</a> for general top marginal corporate income tax rates with a 39.1 percent tax on corporate profits, exceeded by Chad and the United Arab Emirates. So the United States does have a higher corporate tax rate than most of its industrialized peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that the official tax rates are one thing, while the tax rates corporations actually pay can be substantially less. In practice, U.S. companies pay less because they can claim deductions and exclusions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump teed up his statement by mentioning the tax impact on &quot;middle-income Americans and businesses,&quot; which could easily lead listeners to perceive this as a question of overall tax burden, not businesses specifically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump called the United States &quot;one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump tweaked his language this time in effort to improve his accuracy, saying it&rsquo;s &quot;one of&quot; the highest taxed nations. If you believe that he meant the corporate tax rate, given the details about companies and jobs that followed the claim, then Trump&rsquo;s comment is pretty accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, he didn&rsquo;t specify that distinction, and a reasonable listener could take away from Trump&rsquo;s remark that he meant taxes overall, particularly given that he set up the line with a joint reference to middle-income Americans and businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8860395-ac6d-4568-be87-4971393efacb\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8860395-ac6d-4568-be87-4971393efacb</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-22T00:36:21.348799", "ruling_date": "2016-07-22T00:34:21", "ruling_headline": "Trump tweaks talking point about U.S. being 'one of' highest-taxed nations, but it's still flawed", "ruling_headline_slug": "trumps-claim-us-taxes-tweaked", "ruling_link_text": "Trump tweaks thrice-wrong talking point", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview, Raj Shaw, Republican National Committee, July 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-us-not-highest-taxed-nation-in-world/\">For the third time, Donald Trump, U.S. is not &lsquo;highest taxed nation in the world,</a>&rsquo;&quot; May 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/09/eric-bolling/does-us-have-highest-corporate-tax-rate-free-world/\">Does the U.S. have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world</a>?&quot; Sept. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forbes, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/03/19/the-countries-with-the-highest-income-tax-rates-infographic/#6658bed17e8e\">The countries with the highest income tax rates</a>,&quot; March 19, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-he-had-biggest-tax-cuts-any-2016/\">Donald Trump said he had the biggest tax cuts of any 2016 candidate</a>,&quot; July 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew Research&rsquo;s FactTank, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/11/among-developed-nations-americans-tax-bills-are-below-average/\">Among developed nations, Americans&rsquo; tax bills are below average</a>,&quot; Apr. 11, 2016<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "the 2016 Republican National Convention", "statement_date": "2016-07-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ".@realDonaldTrump earns Mostly False for claim about high US tax rates"}
