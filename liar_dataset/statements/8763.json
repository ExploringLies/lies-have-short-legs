Johnson launched the War on Poverty, <em><a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday-chris-wallace/2014/01/12/rep-southerland-rep-van-hollen-war-poverty-what-does-unstable-iraq-mean-us-security#p//v/3045155785001\"><u>Fox News Sunday</u></a></em> invited Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Fla., among others, to discuss the anniversary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Host John Roberts asked Southerland about ending current programs and moving to a system of block grants: &quot;You said, looking back on Lyndon Johnson&#39;s War on Poverty, it has failed and failed miserably. Do you keep putting more money into existing programs or do you -- as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) suggested earlier this week -- fundamentally reform everything, (taking) a big pot of money that the federal government has and (giving) that to the states to administer in innovative ways?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Southerland responded, &quot;I think you have to look at the indicators -- the fundamentals of these programs. Look what causes poverty. We know that two-parent families (are) a child&#39;s greatest opportunity to avoid poverty. We know that a good quality education with daily parent involvement &hellip; reduces poverty. &hellip; If you have a job in this country, (there&rsquo;s a) 97 percent chance that you&#39;re not going to be in poverty. And so, therefore, I think there&#39;s a better way.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several readers asked us to check Southerland&rsquo;s claim that if you have a job, there&rsquo;s a &quot;97 percent chance&quot; that you&#39;re not going to be in poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found Census Bureau data from 2012 that supports his claim. The Census Bureau <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p60-245.pdf\"><u>found</u></a> that 2.9 percent of Americans between 18 and 64 who worked full-time, year-round in 2012 were in poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, we&rsquo;ll note a caveat. Southerland said &quot;if you have a job&quot; -- and there are people in the United States who have jobs, but not full-time, full-year jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among Americans age 18 to 64 who have part-time jobs, the poverty rate is 16.6 percent. And among all workers -- Americans who have either a full- or a part-time job -- the rate is 7.3 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So a more accurate number for the likelihood of poverty &quot;if you have a job&quot; is 92.7 percent, or, rounding up, 93 percent. That&rsquo;s very close to 97 percent, but slightly off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While the percentages may vary slightly from one year to the next, independent sources make clear that your chances of living in poverty increase more than ten-fold if you don&rsquo;t have a steady, full-time job,&quot; said&nbsp;Matt McCullough, a spokesman for Southerland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A final point: The census figures show that nearly 2.9 million people worked full&nbsp;time for the whole year yet still ended up below the poverty line. That may only be 2.9 percent of all full-time workers, but it&rsquo;s still a whole lot of people working, yet still ending up below the poverty line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Southerland said, &quot;If you have a job in this country, (there&#39;s a) 97 percent chance that you&#39;re not going to be in poverty.&quot; That&rsquo;s true only for full-time jobs. If you include both full-time jobs <em>and </em>part-time jobs, then the percentage drops slightly, to 93 percent. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-01-13T17:05:36.654645", "ruling_date": "2014-01-14T11:08:47", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
