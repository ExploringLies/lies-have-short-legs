Scott Walker, a Republican, offered up a tax cut plan for small business, it was reasonable to expect the GOP-led Legislature to approve it with few changes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTurns out there are many practical obstacles to turning a campaign tax promise into reality.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublican lawmakers are considering significant changes to Walker&rsquo;s proposal, with a key meeting set for Jan. 20, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome background: In the 2010 election, Walker promised a 1 percentage point income tax-rate cut for businesses with 50 employees or fewer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter he took office Jan. 3, 2011, he changed and trimmed the plan substantially, proposing a credit targeting businesses with less than $500,000 in gross receipts. Even that scaled-back idea carried an $80 million price tag over two years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn touting the change, here is what Walker said in a Jan. 5 <a href=\"http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/journal_media_detail.asp?prid=5558&amp;locid=177\">news release</a>:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This legislation will provide tax relief to thousands of business owners, freeing them to expand and create jobs,&quot; Walker&rsquo;s office said. &quot;98 percent of all small businesses will be eligible for tax relief under the Governor&rsquo;s proposal.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a broad statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoes virtually every small business in the state stand to benefit from tax relief? And is it enough to spur job growth, as Walker claims?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo back the claim, Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie provided us state tax-filing data showing that 98 percent of all Wisconsin businesses are under the $500,000 in gross receipts -- and therefore eligible to apply.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat number is not in dispute, but let&rsquo;s drill down.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe information provided by Walker showed that in slightly more than half of tax returns, the businesses reported minimal gross sales -- somewhere between $1 and $10,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor that group, there would be negligible tax savings -- based on Walker&rsquo;s data, it would average just over $1. That&rsquo;s barely enough for a candy bar, much less a salary for a new employee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeyond that, there are two problems with the data provided.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, it calculated the tax credit based on an earlier, more generous version of Walker&rsquo;s current proposal. And second, it doesn&rsquo;t account for businesses that don&rsquo;t make a profit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe couldn&rsquo;t obtain similar data on Walker&rsquo;s current proposal, but the state Department of Revenue provided another way to look at the expected size and reach of the 15 percent tax credit he proposed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe department <a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/images/taxmap.bmp\">gave us a </a><a href=\"http://media.journalinteractive.com/images/taxmap.bmp\">chart</a> that projects the average tax credit for personal income tax filers who reported some portion of their income from business. (Most small business owners use the personal-income tax system to report their business income.) The data showed the largest group, with nearly 40 percent of those filers, was under $50,000 in income.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe average credit for that group: $37.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s at the low end.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe average credit tops out at $3,205 for a small group of high earners. They make up about 1 percent of those expected to qualify for the credit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe overall average for all the 252,000 filers who could qualify for the credit -- $145. More than two-thirds would get less than $100 on average.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom both sets of statistics, it&rsquo;s apparent that -- for the majority of those eligible -- the tax credit is enough to stock up on a limited supply of paper clips and printer paper, but not nearly enough to create a job.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRight off the bat that takes some wind out of Walker&rsquo;s claim that the credit would quickly spur needed job creation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe problems don&rsquo;t stop there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBusinesses that don&rsquo;t turn a profit in 2011 would not get a credit -- unless they make money in a future year and take it then. Walker&rsquo;s plan -- set up as an offsetting credit -- kicks in when taxes are owed. It was not set up as a refundable credit; that could have allowed businesses to get it regardless of whether they made a profit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo some percentage of small businesses may be eligible based on gross receipts but won&rsquo;t qualify for a credit next year because they made no profit and therefore have no state tax liability.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow many is that?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState officials couldn&rsquo;t say exactly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the number is apparently substantial. Walker&rsquo;s information listed 335,000 business tax returns that would meet his gross-receipts test, but revenue officials said a much smaller number -- 245,000 filers -- likely would qualify to get the tax credit. They attributed some of the difference to filers who didn&rsquo;t profit enough to owe taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the no-profit issue means those businesses won&rsquo;t be getting a credit any time soon.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, in some cases the tax credit would go to self-employed business people who have no employees. Some critics question how job creation would result from giving them a small credit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBill Smith, head of the state&rsquo;s leading small-business membership group, likes Walker&rsquo;s plan -- but not because it would propel hiring by those who get the credit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&rsquo;m not suggesting you&rsquo;re going to have all this wonderful job creation out there,&quot; said Smith, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSmith said the public should view the tax credits as a kind of indirect economic stimulus, because that $37 credit or $100 credit (or whatever amount it is) will be spent at restaurants or hardware stores or at other Main Street businesses, helping those operations during tough times.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSmith also said Walker&rsquo;s tax plan, along with other measures like lawsuit limits, would boost the spirits of business owners who are pessimistic right now.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s original small-business tax cut -- the one targeted at 50-employee firms or smaller -- would have included firms with $2 million or more in gross sales, Smith said. So it would have reached a much larger group than his current plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother small-business group leader, with the Independent Business Association of Wisconsin, said it&rsquo;s possible that as few as 20 percent of the group&rsquo;s members would fit under the $500,000 sales threshold.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBart Adams, an accountant and IBA board member, said the group is not taking a position on Walker&rsquo;s proposal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s return to the bottom line:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker said 98 percent of small businesses &quot;will be eligible&quot; for job-creating tax relief under his emergency plan to jump-start the lagging Wisconsin economy. There are that many businesses under the $500,000 threshold -- but that&rsquo;s just the beginning of the story.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey may all be eligible to apply, but many won&rsquo;t qualify for a tax credit of any significant size. And the number gets substantially reduced because unprofitable businesses won&rsquo;t see a credit until they turn around. Even business advocates don&rsquo;t contend it would help recipients create jobs, as Walker claims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Walker&rsquo;s claim False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-01-17T19:26:54.377056", "ruling_date": "2011-01-18T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin Gov.
