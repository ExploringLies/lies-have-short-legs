Ralph Hall, R-Texas, a 17-term House member who is facing a tough primary runoff against former U.S. attorney John Ratcliffe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad&rsquo;s sponsor -- the Now or Never PAC -- is going for the jugular by attacking Hall for his age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Ralph Hall was first elected to Congress when Jimmy Carter was president,&quot; the ad says. &quot;Now he&rsquo;s 90 -- the oldest member in Congress ever. With Texas families struggling, he isn&rsquo;t making a difference for us any more. Hall&rsquo;s a Washington insider who&rsquo;s voted for wasteful earmarks and to increase the debt ceiling. Times have changed. After 33 years, let&rsquo;s bring Ralph Hall home.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad is correct that Hall is 90 -- <a href=\"http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=H000067\"><u>he turns 91 on May 3</u></a> -- but we raised our eyebrows at the claim that Hall is &quot;the oldest member in Congress ever.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is correct to say Hall is the oldest serving House member in history. According to the <a href=\"http://history.house.gov/Institution/Firsts-Milestones/Record-Holders/\"><u>U.S House of Representatives</u></a>, Hall passed the previous record-holder for oldest serving member in 2012 -- <a href=\"http://history.house.gov/People/detail/22163\"><u>Charles Manly Stedman</u></a>, who died in office on Sept. 23, 1930.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, as students learn in basic civics class, &quot;Congress&quot; refers to the House <em>and </em>the Senate. And the Senate has had four members older than Hall, according to Senate historian Donald Ritchie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are <a href=\"http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=H000385\"><u>Carl Hayden</u></a>, D-Ariz., who was serving at 91; <a href=\"http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=b001210\"><u>Robert Byrd</u></a>, D-W.Va., who was serving at 92; &nbsp;<a href=\"http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=g000418\"><u>Theodore Francis Green</u></a>, D-R.I., who was serving at 93; and <a href=\"http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=t000254\"><u>Strom Thurmond</u></a> of South Carolina, who was serving as a Republican at 100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ritchie noted one difference between the House and Senate: &quot;House members stand every two years and senators every six, so of all the 90-year-old senators, only Thurmond won re-election in his 90s,&quot; as Hall is trying to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, that&rsquo;s not what the ad said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Now or Never PAC ad said Hall is &quot;the oldest member in Congress ever.&quot; That&rsquo;s not correct -- four members of Congress, all of them senators, have served at a more advanced age than Hall. So we rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-03-20T17:04:37.005616", "ruling_date": "2014-03-20T17:16:45", "ruling_headline": "Ad attacking Texas Rep.
