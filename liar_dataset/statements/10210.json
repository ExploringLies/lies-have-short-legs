What we commonly think of as deportation can include two categories -- returns and removals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The return process is more informal,&quot; said<strong> </strong>Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of immigration policy studies at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group that counts among its funders<strong> </strong>the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation and the World Bank. &quot;It generally takes place at the border and there&rsquo;s no judicial order and no real penalty.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically with a return, a person gets caught and agrees to go back home. Authorities retain a record of their entry and can use that against them if they show up again. Most returns happen right at the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A removal is more formal. There&rsquo;s nothing voluntary about it. It comes with an official order, either from a judge or one of two immigration control agencies. If the person is caught again, he or she may face criminal penalties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the numbers he used, Diaz-Balart focused solely on removals in making his comments. In fact, he has <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/jose-diaz-balart/watch/new-numbers-show-rise-in-deportations-342335043819\">talked about these exact removal stats before</a>&nbsp;(without the additional note that the &quot;vast majority&quot;&nbsp;were non-criminal cases).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Diaz-Balart&rsquo;s claim by the numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Representatives for Diaz-Balart said he relied on data from the <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ois_enforcement_ar_2013.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Department of Homeland Security</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, according to Homeland Security, more than 438,000 people were subject to removal. That is the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/24/record-number-of-deportations-in-2012/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>highest number ever</u></a>. Of those, 45 percent faced some kind of criminal charge; 55 percent did not. The following table, based on Homeland Security data, shows the trends during President Barack Obama&rsquo;s time in office.<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EQgtbWlAh2YBTCqTiTakvm4HyjcWAm_B86o5kl3rEIhgXrzCGbCKRvtBKNQGqzmCgMgezbO0EceNtKwFCWkEjgrmsVL8S0QFifrADUdpTBOUpYOZ2Y5H0PHD6u8Q4U3bTw\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0rad); border:none; height:360px; transform:rotate(0rad); width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do those numbers match Diaz-Balart&rsquo;s statement?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than 1,000 people per day, on average, have been removed from the country since Obama has been president. In 2013, an average of 1,200 people per day were removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But non-criminals no longer make up the &quot;vast majority&quot; of removals and have not since 2009, as Diaz-Balart claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s not accurate to say that the vast majority are non-criminals,&quot; Rosenblum said. &quot;It&rsquo;s a bare majority.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you include returns in the calculation (178,000 in 2013) Diaz-Balart would be correct that the vast majority are non-criminals but would have understated the daily average of returns and removals by close to 700 per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A note about those criminals</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the percentage of criminal removals is high (45 percent), there&rsquo;s enough evidence to tell us this category itself should be viewed with care. Homeland Security reports that violations of immigration law represent nearly a third of the cases. Another 15 percent are criminal traffic offenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can&rsquo;t draw a definitive line between minor and more serious offenses. But the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a big data center at Syracuse University, examined cases handled by courts &mdash; a subset of all the removal actions &mdash; and found about <a href=\"http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/356/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>90 percent of the convictions</u></a> there have been for illegal entry or re-entry. (In short, these people&rsquo;s crime is entering the country illegally in the first place.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California-Davis School of Law, said his reading of the record tells him immigration officials define criminality quite broadly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Throughout the Obama years, the data has shown that removals based on non-criminal or minor criminal offenses, such as driving without a license, have greatly outnumbered the removals of serious criminal offenders,&quot; Johnson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diaz-Balart said that 1,000 people are deported each day and the vast majority are not criminals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diaz-Balart is right that 1,000&nbsp;people a day<strong> </strong>on average are formally removed from the country. In fact, in 2013, it was 1,200 per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he reached too far by saying the &quot;vast majority&quot; are not criminals.&nbsp;Strictly speaking, non-criminal removals only slightly outnumber the people removed under the cloud of a criminal charge. Those crimes in many cases include entering the country illegally or overstaying a visa. But they are still crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-11-11T15:18:52.149460", "ruling_date": "2014-11-12T10:10:01", "ruling_headline": "Jose Diaz-Balart: 1,000 deportations every day, vast majority aren't criminals", "ruling_headline_slug": "diaz-balart-vast-majority-deportees-arent-criminal", "ruling_link_text": "Should've skipped 'vast'", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>NBC, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-transcript-november-9-2014-n244591\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Meet the Press</u></a>, Nov. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Department of Homeland Security, <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ois_enforcement_ar_2013.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Immigration enforcement actions - 2013</u></a>, September, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Migration Policy Institute, <a href=\"http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/deportation-dilemma-reconciling-tough-humane-enforcement\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Deportation Dilemma: Reconciling Tough and Humane Enforcement</u></a>, April 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Migration Policy Institute, <a href=\"http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/deportation-and-discretion-reviewing-record-and-options-change\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Deportation and Discretion: Reviewing the Record and Options for Change</u></a>, October 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew Research Center, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/24/record-number-of-deportations-in-2012/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Record number of deportations in 2012</u></a>, Jan. 24, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew Research Center, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/11/10/5-takeaways-about-the-2014-latino-vote/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>5 takeaways about the 2014 Latino vote</u></a>, Nov. 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRAC Immigration, <a href=\"http://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/charges/apprep_newfiling_charge.php\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Nature of Charge in New Filings Seeking Removal Orders through August 2014</u></a>, August 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRAC Immigration, <a href=\"http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/356/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Despite Rise in Felony Charges, Most Immigration Convictions Remain Misdemeanors</u></a>, June 26, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MSNBC, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/jose-diaz-balart/watch/new-numbers-show-rise-in-deportations-342335043819\">New numbers show rise in deportations</a>, Oct. 14, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Marc Rosenblum, deputy director, Immigration Policy, Migration Policy Institute, Nov. 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Diana Rocco, director, Media Relations, MSNBC, Nov. 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Kevin Johnson, dean, School of Law, University of California - Davis, Nov. 10, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Jose", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 2990, "last_name": "Diaz-Balart", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "jose-diaz-balart", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Diaz-Balart.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2990/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Every single day in this country, 1,000 people are deported and the vast majority of those people that are deported aren&#39;t criminals.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a broadcast of NBC's \"Meet the Press\"", "statement_date": "2014-11-09", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>Amnesty,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">self-deportation</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/donald-trump-mexico-immigration-presidential-campaign\">wall</a>.
