Williams gave at least $140,000 in gifts and loans to Gov. Bob McDonnell&rsquo;s family, many of which were not reported on state disclosure forms filed by McDonnell.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tCuccinelli announced this spring that he had omitted $12,000 in gifts on disclosure forms he filed between 2009 and 2012, saying it was an oversight. Of the gifts, about $5,000 came from Williams, who gave the attorney general a trip to New York aboard his private jet, a catered Thanksgiving dinner and vacations at Williams&rsquo; Smith Mountain Lake home.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAmid criticism from Democrats, Cuccinelli in April appointed Richmond Commonwealth&rsquo;s Attorney Michael Herring to investigate whether Cuccinelli had violated state disclosure laws.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tHerring, in a nine-page report released on July 18, wrote &quot;our investigation finds no evidence&quot; that Cuccinelli violated any laws or intentionally failed to disclose the gifts.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tContrary to McAuliffe&rsquo;s statement, the report does not say Cuccinelli &quot;should have been prosecuted but Virginia laws are insufficient.&quot; The report does not mention the word &quot;prosecute&quot; and it offers no opinion on the strength or weakness of the state&#39;s disclosure laws.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMcAuliffe, after the debate, was asked to pinpoint language in the report verifying his claim. He offered nothing specific. &quot;Well, that&rsquo;s my analysis of the report,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMcAuliffe said the ethics report said Cuccinelli &quot;should have been prosecuted, but Virginia laws are insufficient.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThere is nothing in the report that remotely supports McAuliffe&rsquo;s claim. To the contrary, the report concludes Cuccinelli did not violate any laws.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMcAuliffe&rsquo;s hyperbolic statement is not only wrong, it defies any reasonable reading of the report.
