(Maybe Obama did it; maybe his campaign manager did. A spokesman for his 2008 presidential campaign later said that staff &quot;<a href=\"http://factcheck.org/2008/09/nra-targets-obama/\">unintentionally mischaracterized his position</a>,&quot; and that he never saw the survey.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe questionnaire asked about Obama&rsquo;s stance on various issues, including, &quot;Do you support state legislation to &hellip; ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe typed answer: Yes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(You can see the questionnaire <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/static/PPM41_obamaquestionaire1newest.html\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/static/PPM41_obamaquestionaire2.html\">here</a>, and read stories about it by the <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2007-12-22-2414012588_x.htm\">Associated Press</a> and <em><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1207/7312.html\">POLITICO</a></em>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama never endorsed a &quot;total ban.&quot; But his campaign for state Senate almost 16 years ago did say yes to supporting such a ban on a state level in a questionnaire.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat came of the campaign endorsement of such a policy?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2007-12-22-2414012588_x.htm\">Associated Press noted</a> that Obama&#39;s legislative record in Illinois &quot;shows strong support for gun restrictions, such as limiting handgun purchases to one a month, but no attempts to ban them.&quot; On a different questionnaire eight years later, Obama&rsquo;s position was that &quot;a complete ban on handguns is not politically practicable&quot; but that reasonable restrictions should be imposed, AP reported.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The president&rsquo;s policies</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHas Obama&rsquo;s presidential administration shown sympathy for banning handguns?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2009, <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2009/12/international-gun-ban-treaty/\">FactCheck.org</a> said, &quot;We&rsquo;ve seen little or no evidence that the Obama administration is doing much to regulate guns or gun ownership.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2010, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence gave the president <a href=\"http://www.bradycenter.org/xshare/reports/fedleg/obama-1styear-report.pdf\">a report card of seven F&rsquo;s</a> for his first year in office, including on &quot;standing up the to the gun lobby.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe talked with Caroline Brewer, director of communications for the Brady Center&rsquo;s sister organization, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We certainly don&#39;t have a record of him calling for a ban of any kind on handguns in the United States,&quot; she said. &quot;... There&#39;s no logical reason to believe the president would ever advocate the banning of all handguns, and we as organization don&#39;t advocate for that, either.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe noted that after the Tucson, Ariz., shootings that injured former U.S. Rep.

And the courts have settled that as the law of the land. In this country, we have a strong tradition of gun ownership that&#39;s handed from generation to generation. Hunting and shooting are part of our national heritage. And, in fact, my administration has not curtailed the rights of gun owners &mdash; it has expanded them, including allowing people to carry their guns in national parks and wildlife refuges. &hellip;</em></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<em>&quot;I&#39;m willing to bet that responsible, law-abiding gun owners agree that we should be able to keep an irresponsible, law-breaking few &mdash; dangerous criminals and fugitives, for example &mdash; from getting their hands on a gun in the first place.</em></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<em>&quot;I&#39;m willing to bet they don&#39;t think that using a gun and using common sense are incompatible ideas &mdash; that we should check someone&#39;s criminal record before he can check out at a gun seller; that an unbalanced man shouldn&#39;t be able to buy a gun so easily; that there&#39;s room for us to have reasonable laws that uphold liberty, ensure citizen safety and are fully compatible with a robust Second Amendment.&quot;</em></blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(It&rsquo;s true, by the way, that <a href=\"http://www.bradycampaign.org/action/contactobama\">Obama repealed Reagan-era rules</a> to keep loaded guns out of national parks, something else that didn&rsquo;t sit well with the Brady Campaign.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLaPierre argues Obama&rsquo;s rhetoric is a sign that he&rsquo;s biding his time until a second term, when he&rsquo;ll unfurl his full anti-gun agenda &mdash; an uncheckable prediction. (See: &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nrapublications.org/index.php/11920/obamas-secret-plan-to-destroy-the-second-amendment-by-2016/\">Obama&rsquo;s Secret Plan To Destroy The Second Amendment By 2016</a>.&quot;) However, none of Obama&rsquo;s previous years in office hint at the kind of extreme policy push the NRA claims he&rsquo;s yearning to unleash.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLaPierre said &quot;(Obama) endorsed a total ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of all handguns.&quot; Obama&rsquo;s 1996 campaign for state Senate did endorse a state-level ban, on a questionnaire from which he has since distanced himself.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe never suggested such a law in office, and later questionnaires showed a more nuanced approach, as have his more recent statements on gun control, including those during his time in the U.S. Senate and as president. In fact, his gun-control agenda has earned him failing grades from a prominent gun-control advocacy group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe can&rsquo;t rule on a shadowy conspiracy to destroy the Constitution in Obama&rsquo;s second term. But we can say that LaPierre&rsquo;s claim that Obama endorsed a total ban on handguns contains a small element of truth (a typewritten &quot;yes&quot; on a long-ago questionnaire about a state ban) but ignores critical facts &mdash; that is, Obama&#39;s statements and record &mdash; that would give a different impression.
