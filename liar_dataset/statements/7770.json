The first, <a href=\"https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/workingpapers/citation.aspx?PubId=8956&amp;type=WPN\">published</a> in March by Harvard professor Linda Bilmes, found that the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts will be the most expensive wars in U.S. history, totaling between $4 trillion and $6 trillion. Along with traditional war costs such as weapons and equipment, Bilmes&rsquo; study included long-term medical and disability costs for service members and their families.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tThe second <a href=\"http://costsofwar.org/article/economic-cost-summary\">study</a>, by the Cost of War Project, lists current spending, including interest paid on war debt, through fiscal 2013 at $3.1 trillion.

The amount could rise much higher based on future interest payments.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tCensus data reports almost <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html\">115 million households</a> existed in the country from 2007-2011, according to the most recent data.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tAt $4 trillion, each of the 115 million households would be responsible for just under $35,000 of the war costs.

This past week, the constantly increasing total had reached over $1.4 trillion. Based on that figure, each of the country&rsquo;s households would be responsible for around $12,300 in war costs thus far. Data from the Congressional Budget Office also shows that about <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/01-31-2012_Outlook.pdf\">$1.4 trillion</a> has been approved for the wars, including some funds for veterans&rsquo; benefits and services.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tNational Priorities, a nonprofit organization that analyzes the federal budget, includes only funds that have been appropriated by the government that can be found in appropriations documents.

(For example, Georgia taxpayers have contributed $35.6 billion, which could have also funded 721,000 police officers, or 4.8 million Head Start slots, or 4.7 million college scholarships, etc., for one year.)</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tSo, do Roberts&rsquo; numbers add up?</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tHer claim that the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have cost each U.S. household $45,000 would mean that war spending -- including future veterans&rsquo; benefits and debt service costs -- would have to be about $5.2 trillion.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tThe most recent studies that include these long-term costs report war spending between $4 trillion and $6 trillion.
