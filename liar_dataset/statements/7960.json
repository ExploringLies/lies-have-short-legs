It&rsquo;s a claim he&rsquo;s made before.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Not one tax has been raised since I&#39;ve been governor,&quot; Christie said during a brief portion of the show where he compared his fiscal actions as governor with those of state Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), who is challenging him in the Nov. 5 gubernatorial contest.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPrevious Truth-O-Meter rulings have determined this claim isn&rsquo;t entirely accurate. And PolitiFact New Jersey remains as confident as the governor in that fact.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s begin by reviewing the major taxes in New Jersey.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s true that rates for income, sales and corporation business taxes -- the state&rsquo;s three biggest revenue generators -- have not gone up under Christie.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut tax increases have resulted when Christie cut funding for tax-credit programs, according to several experts who have told us that those reductions are essentially tax increases.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;For practical purposes, decreasing tax credits is the same as a tax increase. The person&#39;s effective tax rate goes up,&quot; David Brunori, a research professor of public policy at The George Washington University, explained in an e-mail. &quot;Still, most people think of tax increases as rate hikes.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRates haven&rsquo;t increased, but the reduced tax credits mean some homeowners and certain low-income individuals are receiving less money to offset their tax bills.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Earned Income Tax Credit is one example.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNew Jersey scaled back the EITC during Christie&rsquo;s first year in office. The state Treasury Department website has explained that the EITC &quot;reduces the amount of New Jersey tax you owe and may also give you a refund, even if you have no tax liability to New Jersey.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition to that reduction, Christie cut spending for two property tax relief programs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBudget analyses from the state&rsquo;s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services showed that &nbsp;homeowners who qualified for one of those programs, now called the Homestead Benefit program, received an average rebate of more than $1,000 in fiscal year 2010. Now, the average credit is less than half that amount. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tState Treasury Department officials have argued that the tax credit programs are payments from the state, and reductions in credits do not represent tax increases.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBill Quinn, a Treasury Department spokesman, has said that the EITC in most cases actually represented a subsidy to low-income people and noted that more than 75 percent of people getting the credit in 2010 owed no New Jersey tax.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStill, Dennis J. Ventry, Jr., a professor at University of California Davis School of Law, said that a reduction in a tax credit is &quot;absolutely a tax increase.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Tax credits reduce tax liability for eligible claimants. Thus, cutting, restricting, or repealing a tax credit for an otherwise eligible individual or business would -- absent other changes to the tax system such as a reduction in rates -- result in higher taxes owed,&quot; Ventry said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRichard Pomp, a law professor at the University of Connecticut and state taxation expert said debate about the issue is semantics. &quot;To someone who has had a benefit cut that is less money they have to spend,&quot; whether you call it a tax increase or a spending cut.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, Joseph Henchman, vice president of legal and state projects at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, said it&rsquo;d be wrong to equate reductions in tax credits as tax increases or spending cuts. &quot;They have elements of both and are strictly neither,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tChristie said on a radio program, &quot;Not one tax has been raised since I&#39;ve been governor.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe governor is correct that the major taxes in New Jersey that generate revenue have not increased. But he doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge that cuts he&rsquo;s made to tax-relief programs have resulted in tax increases for certain segments of the population.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSeveral experts we talked to agreed that reductions in tax-relief programs can result in higher taxes owed for some people. That amounts to an increase, and that&rsquo;s why this claim is rated Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this story, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/06/politifact_nj_ chris_christie_claims_states_had_no_new_tax_increases_since_hes_been_governor.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-06-28T13:39:52.953655", "ruling_date": "2013-06-30T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie claims there have been no tax increases since he's been governor", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-claims-there-have-been-no-tax-incre", "ruling_link_text": "Repeating a claim doesn't make it accurate", "ruling_state": "New Jersey", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-638050e6-8bde-b8a4-4f92-725f4f7973d1\">\r\n\tNJ1015.com, &quot;Ask The Governor&quot; radio call-in program podcast, June 26, 2013, accessed June 27, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey, Chris Christie says he hasn&rsquo;t raised taxes in New Jersey, Aug. 23, 2012, accessed June 27 and 28, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/24/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-says-new-jersey-budget-doubled-/\">Gov.
