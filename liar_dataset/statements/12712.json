But they also made partisan jabs, including this one by Duffy:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/hillary-clinton/\">Hillary Clinton</a> have left us with $19 trillion in debt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked three federal budget experts, including <a href=\"http://www.concordcoalition.org/about-us/national-staff/bbixby\">Robert Bixby</a>, executive director of the Concord Coalition, about Duffy&rsquo;s claim. &quot;It&rsquo;s sort of garden-variety political exaggeration,&quot; Bixby said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Debt figures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Treasury Department&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current\">&quot;Debt to the Penny&quot; calculator</a> shows the total federal debt is nearly $19.4 trillion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That includes nearly $14 trillion in debt held by the public -- by individuals, corporations, Federal Reserve banks, foreign governments, and other entities -- and $5.4 trillion in what are known as intragovernmental holdings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Duffy is correct on the overall figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But many factors bear on how it got there. And, the experts said, it&rsquo;s really not possible to calculate how much any one of them is responsible for the debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bixby; <a href=\"http://crfb.org/maya-macguineas-president\">Maya MacGuineas</a>, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget;&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/author/rudolph-g-penner\">Rudolph Penner</a>, a fellow at the Urban Institute and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, told us:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong> About half of the $19 trillion was amassed before Obama took office in January 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Obama took office amid a deep recession, which meant government revenues fell and spending on government programs rose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The debt would have exploded certainly during (Obama&rsquo;s) first term, no matter who was president,&quot; said Bixby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. </strong>Obama&nbsp;proposed&nbsp;federal budgets, but Congress, including the Republican leadership,&nbsp;ultimately holds the purse strings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama bears some of the responsibility for not taking steps to prevent the debt from growing, &quot;but attributing the debt to a president doesn&rsquo;t make sense,&quot; said MacGuineas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Clinton, as Obama&rsquo;s secretary of state, made budget requests for her department. But that&rsquo;s a tiny amount of the overall federal budget and the secretary of state has virtually nothing to do with overall fiscal policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duffy said: &quot;Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have left us with $19 trillion in debt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The total federal debt is at $19 trillion. But most of it was amassed before Obama took office. And many factors -- Congress, the economy and Obama himself, but to almost no extent Clinton -- played a role in the debt increases during Obama&rsquo;s tenure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a claim that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/212be74c-0104-4349-a8ef-bade8c9f88f1\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/212be74c-0104-4349-a8ef-bade8c9f88f1</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-19T13:43:28.069772", "ruling_date": "2016-07-19T13:42:48", "ruling_headline": "GOP Rep.
