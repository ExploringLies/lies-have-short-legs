If we look at all amendments, not just those passed by roll call votes, Traficant passed 72 more than Sanders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Jersey Republican Chris Smith, who served in the same time period as Sanders, finished third with <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/member/christopher-smith/S000522?q=%7B%22congress%22%3A%5B%22104%22%2C%22105%22%2C%22106%22%2C%22107%22%2C%22108%22%2C%22109%22%5D%2C%22type%22%3A%22amendments%22%7D&amp;page=2\">14 roll call amendments</a> (and 32 overall amendments).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Craig Volden, an expert on the legislative process at the University of Virginia, told PolitiFact that records like these are rather unusual in the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are so few members with large numbers of substantive and successful amendments,&quot; he said. &quot;Sanders and Traficant were exceptions to that rule.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In comparison, Hillary Clinton passed <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/member/hillary-clinton/C001041?pageSize=250&amp;q=%7B%22congress%22%3A%22all%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22amendments%22%2C%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%7D&amp;page=1\">zero</a> roll call amendments during her tenure as a senator from New York from 2001-09.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Overall effectiveness</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the current Congress, Sanders ranks fourth when it comes to the number of career roll call amendments passed, according GovTrack founder, Josh Tauberer. The three lawmakers who top him are Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., with 27 in 15 years in Congress; Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., with 24 in 33 years; and Rep Steve King, R-Iowa, with 22 in 13 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roll call amendments aside, Sanders isn&rsquo;t shattering any legislative records, though he&rsquo;s not doing poorly either. Tauberer&rsquo;s research places Sanders at No. 14 in Congress with 90 amendments. The other senator from Vermont, Democrat Patrick Leahy, on the other hand, has passed 226.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, amendments are just one of the ways lawmakers press their agendas. Sanders has had much less luck with passing bills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his 25 years in Congress, Sanders introduced <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/member/bernard-sanders/S000033?q=%7B%22congress%22%3A%22all%22%2C%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22bills%22%2C%22bill-status%22%3A%22introduced%22%7D\">324 bills</a>, three of which became <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/member/bernard-sanders/S000033?q=%7B%22congress%22%3A%22all%22%2C%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22bills%22%2C%22bill-status%22%3A%5B%22passed-one%22%2C%22passed-both%22%2C%22law%22%5D%7D\">law</a>. This includes a bill in a Republican Congress <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/5245\">naming</a> a post office in Vermont and two more while Democrats had control (one <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/885\">naming</a> another Vermont post office and <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/893\">another</a> increasing veterans&rsquo; disability compensation). Clinton, for the record, also passed <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/member/hillary-clinton/C001041?q=%7B%22congress%22%3A%22all%22%2C%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22bills%22%2C%22bill-status%22%3A%22law%22%7D\">three bills</a> in eight years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the sparse number of bills isn&rsquo;t surprising. Volden and Vanderbilt University&rsquo;s Alan Wiseman assess the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thelawmakers.org/#/find\">legislative effectiveness</a> of House members by comparing their records to a benchmark.
