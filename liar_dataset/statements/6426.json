She also rolled out a new contention, that Browning &quot;allowed 1,800 illegal voters to register in Florida&quot; during his tenure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBrowning scoffed at the claim, which includes a number of alleged noncitizen voters we&#39;d never seen before. We set out in search of her facts.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull; &bull; &bull;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn early 2011, while Browning was secretary of state, the Division of Elections learned the Department of Motor Vehicles maintained a database that categorized driver&#39;s license holders as citizens and noncitizens, spokesman Chris Cate said. (Cate worked at the time for Browning; he and his wife have since donated $50 to Browning&#39;s campaign.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter a discussion with Gov. Rick Scott, Browning decided to take a closer look at just how many noncitizens might be registered to vote. Officials took the driver&#39;s license database and compared it to the state voter registration list.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe first pass-through generated 180,000 names of <i>potential</i> noncitizen voters, a number that was widely reported by the news media. But Browning was skeptical of that figure: The data was crunched by DMV, not his own department. And he suspected it included some people who obtained their citizenship and registered to vote <i>after</i> they got their last driver&#39;s license. The driver&#39;s license database might not reflect their current citizenship status.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA later effort whittled the list down to 2,600 names, including about 1,400 verified matches from the first list and 1,200 people who get annual driver&#39;s licenses because they are on work or student visas. That list went to county elections supervisors to review.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThose supervisors did their due diligence, giving the voters in question an opportunity to respond. Some voters quickly returned documents verifying their citizenship.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPasco County Supervisor of Elections Brian Corley said of the 13 names he received, &quot;more than half were actually U.S. citizens.&quot; One woman was improperly flagged when her records were mistaken for someone else&#39;s, Corley said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter finding flaws in its methodology, the Department of State told supervisors of elections to stop using the list of 2,600 names.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;We consider that number obsolete now,&quot; Cate said. The state is working out an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to better identify noncitizens and compare that list to the voter rolls.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs for Fiorentino&#39;s flier: &quot;I don&#39;t know where they would come up with a number of 1,800,&quot; Cate said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFiorentino acknowledged her flier contained a typo: She meant to use the original 180,000 figure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;I was kinder than it should have been,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull; &bull; &bull;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe question then turns to whether Browning &quot;allowed&quot; all &mdash; or any &mdash; of those voters to register.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe secretary of state is Florida&#39;s chief election officer. His responsibilities include creating and administering a statewide voter registration system. &quot;The secretary may delegate voter registration duties and records maintenance activities to voter registration officials,&quot; Florida statute states.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThose officials include<b> </b>county<b> </b>supervisors of elections, whose powers include accepting voter registration applications and updating the statewide voter registration system.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;It is the supervisor who is activating the voters,&quot; Cate explained.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFrom that perspective, Browning did not have a hand in the registration.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe also was secretary of state from 2006-10, and again from 2011-12. The voter list under review included registrations from years outside his terms.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull; &bull; &bull;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFiorentino said she was aware the 180,000 number represented &quot;all the people&quot; initially tagged. She argued that Browning allowed illegal voters to remain on the rolls even after several elections supervisors, including Corley, raised red flags in 2011.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;He did nothing,&quot; she said. &quot;I call that allowing.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBrowning emphasized that supervisors of election are responsible for voter registration. &quot;I didn&#39;t register those voters,&quot; he said. He added that he had no firm number of illegal voters but that he tried as secretary of state to identify them so local elections officials could address them. &quot;She doesn&#39;t understand how the law works,&quot; Browning said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>Our ruling</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFiorentino accused Browning of &quot;allowing 1,800 illegal voters to register in Florida.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHer number is wrong. The state&#39;s initial list of 180,000 names never identified voters as illegal, but rather created a starting point for further verification. The state later stopped using the list, deeming the data unreliable.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe secretary of state does not register voters in Florida, nor does he have the authority to remove them from the rolls. That&#39;s the job of county elections supervisors. And Browning was not secretary of state during the entire time the people on that list registered to vote.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFiorentino played fast and loose with her claim in an effort to discredit her opponent on election eve.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rule her claim Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-08T18:27:40.914845", "ruling_date": "2012-08-09T09:24:37", "ruling_headline": "Heather Fiorentino said Kurt Browning \"allowed 1,800 illegal voters to register in Florida\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "heather-fiorentino-said-kurt-browning-allowed-1800", "ruling_link_text": "Number is wrong, plus he didn't 'allow'", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tInterview with Chris Cate, spokesman for the Florida Division of Elections</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with Pasco County schools superintendent Heather Fiorentino</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with Kurt Browning</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with Pasco County Supervisor of Elections Brian Corley</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact Florida, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/jul/10/moveon/moveon-says-gov-rick-scott-tried-kick-180000-peopl/\">MoveOn says Gov.
