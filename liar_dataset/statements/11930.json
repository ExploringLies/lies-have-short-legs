Further down on the page: &quot;In 2007, Joe Straus received a 100 percent rating by NARAL (the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hPGzvM-AwidRgQgPQIgyoLv3pFkjAIjO0wtKdD5iMPqSFXv4m5XJGyI_CwkGvUinObY7u8bbgPukAQLJWaxkIlPaeQJcZGoGlIEk6WLppJ8g11644a5e57dTYxskMFk_15EkoDvQ\" style=\"border:none; height:207px; width:152px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Image from SpeakerStraus.com</strong></em> (fetched Feb. 12, 2016)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if the foundation&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.speakerstraus.com/\">representation</a> of NARAL&rsquo;s ratings were accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it turned out, the posted 2005 rating for Straus was inaccurate and the one for 2007 could arguably use a blinking asterisk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NARAL scorecards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The foundation didn&#39;t respond to repeated inquiries. But we found the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20091017003341/http://www.prochoicetexas.org/instate/legislators.shtml\">NARAL Pro-Choice Texas scorecards using the web&rsquo;s Wayback Machine</a> and confirmed their authenticity with a NARAL representative. In 2005, that year&rsquo;s scorecard shows, the group gave Straus a 45 percent rating &mdash; not &quot;100&quot; &mdash; for his House votes. Straus leaned &quot;pro-choice,&quot; the &lsquo;05 scorecard says, in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20081006201446/http://www.prochoicetexas.org/instate/2005legislativeguide_rep01-06.shtml\">voting to require</a> agencies getting funds for abstinence-only sex education to report to the state about successes reducing teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases and also <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20081006200729/http://www.prochoicetexas.org/instate/2005legislativeguide_rep07-12.shtml\">voting on the group&rsquo;s side in four instances</a> during action on abortion restrictions. But Straus otherwise took six &quot;anti-choice&quot; votes that session, the scorecard says, fueling his 5-of-11 rating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20081006200602/http://www.prochoicetexas.org/instate/2007legislativeguide_rep07-09.shtml\">2007 scorecard</a> indeed shows a &quot;100%&quot; score for Straus based on his &quot;pro-choice&quot; vote against setting aside a NARAL-backed amendment to the 2008-09 state budget. But a web search led us to a Dec. 16, 2014, <a href=\"https://www.texasallianceforlife.org/8-false-claims-joe-straus/\">blog post</a> by the anti-abortion Texas Alliance for Life&rsquo;s Joe Pojman stating Straus&rsquo;s 2007 rating &quot;has little validity. NARAL&rsquo;s scorecard is wrong.&quot; That is, Pojman wrote, Straus didn&rsquo;t even vote on the amendment that NARAL&rsquo;s scorecard cites for Straus&rsquo; &quot;100.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The 2007 vote</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stop the carousel: Did Straus get his &lsquo;07 &quot;100&quot; based on a single, possibly misreported vote?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the &lsquo;07 scorecard, Straus got his &quot;100&quot; for being 1-for-1 on the group&rsquo;s scored votes in which he participated &mdash; a result confirmed by email by Zoey Lichtenheld, communications coordinator for NARAL Pro-Choice Texas. Then again, the scorecard shows, Straus didn&rsquo;t vote on 10 other items potentially affecting each House member&rsquo;s NARAL rating; he wasn&rsquo;t on the House State Affairs Committee where the votes occurred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lichtenfeld said NARAL records indicate Straus on March 29, 2007, voted on the group&rsquo;s side against tabling proposed Amendment 20 to the 2008-09 state budget, the <a href=\"http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Appropriations_Bills/80/Committee%20Substitute%20for%20HB1.pdf\">committee substitute for House Bill 1</a>. That amendment, offered by Rep. Elliott Naishtat, D-Austin, sought to strip the state&rsquo;s Alternatives to Abortion program of its $5 million in funding over two years and put that amount into child abuse prevention grants for community organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alternatives to Abortion program</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Alternatives to Abortion program&rsquo;s state backing traces to 2005 when <a href=\"http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Documents/GAA/General_Appropriations_Act_2006-07.pdf#page=221\">a rider to the 2006-07 appropriations act</a> directed $2.5 million a year in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funding to the Texas Department of Health and Human Services to implement a program &quot;focused on pregnancy support services that promote childbirth&quot; among women who don&rsquo;t want abortions. &nbsp;The program took the form of a network of clinics run by the nonprofit Texas Pregnancy Care Network that offer counseling along with adoption and parenting resources. In 2011, lawmakers amended a 2003 law and newly required doctors to give patients <a href=\"https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/wrtk/default.shtm\">a directory listing such centers</a> (along with a sonogram and verbal explanation of the sonogram) 24 hours before performing an abortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NARAL has been an <a href=\"http://txpregnancy.org/section/your-tax-dollars-at-waste/\">outspoken opponent of the Alternatives to Abortion program</a> and of crisis pregnancy centers <a href=\"http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/download-files/cpc-report-2015.pdf\">in general</a>, deeming them &quot;outposts across the country with the sole purpose of preventing women from accessing abortion (through lies and coercion).&quot; In a March 2011 <a href=\"http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=163224\">report</a>, NARAL Pro-Choice Texas called the Alternatives to Abortion program &quot;bad health policy, bad fiscal policy,&quot; and described the program&rsquo;s primary provider, the Texas Pregnancy Care Network, as &quot;a wasteful and inefficient public structure&quot; that &quot;overestimated its budget needs by half a million dollars in FY 2010.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>House Journal: Straus absent from vote</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what was Straus&rsquo; position? We checked the <a href=\"http://www.journals.house.state.tx.us/hjrnl/80r/pdf/80RDAY46FINAL.PDF#page=22\">Texas House Journal</a> for voting details. It says Straus &mdash; who otherwise participated in 26 of 35 votes that day &mdash; was absent during the vote on Amendment 20, as were 11 of his colleagues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>House-posted <a href=\"http://tlchouse.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=17&amp;clip_id=4775\">video of the floor action that day </a>shows that after the amendment was offered, another legislator moved to table it. Next, Speaker Tom Craddick announced the unfavorable-to-NARAL result (89 ayes to 48 nays); the journal presents the same tally. From the video, we further determined that a few minutes after the vote, Straus wasn&rsquo;t at his desk on the floor; members usually vote from their desks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The speaker&rsquo;s press secretary, Jason Embry, said by email he wasn&rsquo;t sure why Straus missed the decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The foundation says Straus in 2005 and 2007 received 100 percent NARAL ratings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the contrary, Straus got a 45 percent &quot;pro-choice&quot; NARAL rating in 2005. And while he got that &quot;100&quot; in 2007, that result was based entirely on the group concluding that Straus sided with it on a budget amendment when, records show, he was absent from the scored vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On balance, we rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY FALSE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"> more</a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-17T18:19:34.790697", "ruling_date": "2016-02-18T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Claim shows abortion rights group gave '100' to Joe Straus for 2007 vote he evidently didn't cast", "ruling_headline_slug": "claim-shows-abortion-rights-group-gave-100-joe-str", "ruling_link_text": "Do the math", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Web page, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.speakerstraus.com/\">The Joe Straus Record: Opposing Conservatives &amp; Obstructing Reforms.&quot;</a> The Empower Texans Foundation (accessed Jan. 28, 2016)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blog post, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.texasallianceforlife.org/8-false-claims-joe-straus/\">8 False Claims about Joe Straus</a>,&quot; Joe Pojman, Texas Alliance for Life, Dec. 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.journals.house.state.tx.us/hjrnl/80r/pdf/80RDAY46FINAL.PDF#page=22\">House Journal</a>, 2007 Texas Legislature, Regular Session, March 29, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lbb.state.tx.us/Appropriations_Bills/80/Committee%20Substitute%20for%20HB1.pdf\">Bill</a>, Committee Substitute for House Bill 1, Eightieth Legislature, State of Texas, March 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blog post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.redstate.com/diary/Erick/2011/01/07/will-the-people-of-texas-fold-or-fight-for-conservatives/\">Will the People of Texas Fold or Fight for Conservatives?</a>&quot; Erick Erickson, Redstate, Jan. 7, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blog post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.lifenews.com/2010/12/09/opi-1032/\">Straus being 50 percent pro-life not good enough for Texas,</a>&quot; Dr. Joseph Graham, LifeNews, Dec. 9, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Report, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=163224\">The Texas &quot;Alternatives to Abortion&quot; Program: Bad Health Policy, Bad Fiscal Policy,</a>&quot; Sara S.
