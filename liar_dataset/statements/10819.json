Fiorina later was fired by HP&rsquo;s board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On <em>Meet the Press</em> Sunday, host Chuck Todd asked Fiorina why she was fired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiorina used the question to list her accomplishments at HP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What people fail to comment on is the fact we doubled the size of the company, took the growth rate from 2 percent to 9 percent,&quot; she said. &quot;We tripled the rate of innovation to 11 patents a day and went from lagging behind to leading in every product category. We grew jobs here in the U.S. and all over the world. You can&#39;t just leave those facts out -- they are as vital to the record as the fact that yes, indeed, I had to make tough calls during tough times. Tough times that many technology companies didn&#39;t survive at all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given Fiorina&rsquo;s dismissal and other issues at HP, we were interested in that first claim -- that under her leadership, the company doubled in size.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiorina&#39;s&nbsp;claim is not referring to the number of employees (you can read a good primer on that from our archives <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/17/barbara-boxer/ad-sen-barbara-boxer-attacks-carly-fiorina-layoffs/\">here</a>). In this case,&nbsp;staff at Carly for America (Fiorina&rsquo;s political action committee) said she was referring to the revenues created by the company.&nbsp;By this specific measure, HP did double.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1999, when Fiorina became CEO, HP&rsquo;s annual revenue was $42.4 billion, according to annual <a href=\"http://h30261.www3.hp.com/financial/sec-filings/hp-sec-filings.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Securities and Exchange Commission filings</u></a>. With the exception of a slight dip in 2001 (at the end of the dot-com bubble), revenue increased each year -- to $86.7 billion in 2005, the year she left. That&rsquo;s a little bit more than double.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t tell the entire tale. There are a few critical caveats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where the growth came from</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why such growth? Well, Fiorina spearheaded a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/04/business/hewlett-packard-in-deal-to-buy-compaq-for-25-billion-in-stock.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>major $25 billion acquisition</u></a> of HP&rsquo;s rival, Compaq, to increase the company&rsquo;s share of the personal computer market. The merger was publicly controversial, in part because it tipped HP&rsquo;s focus toward computers (a tough market) and away from its most successful product, printers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The merger went through, and the company grew. In 2001, the year before the merger, revenue was $45.7 billion, and the Compaq revenue was about $40 billion. In 2003, after the two companies merged, revenue was $73 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stephen Morrissette, a business professor at the University of Chicago, noted that the fact that so much of the revenue growth was a result of the merger casts some shade on Fiorina&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Most executives would likely not use the phrasing &lsquo;doubled the size of the company&rsquo; to describe their performance if the increase was all or mostly due to an acquisition,&quot; Morrissette said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Doubled revenues, but not necessarily stronger</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the increased revenue, the HP-Compaq merger led to sluggish stock prices and missed profitability targets. The merger also led to the thousands of firings often cited by Fiorina&rsquo;s critics. The merger was widely seen as a <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2011/08/21/why-carlys-big-bet-is-failing-fortune-classics-2005/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>bust</u></a> at the time, and it contributed to the HP board&rsquo;s decision to fire Fiorina. (HP stock value <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/blog/2011/08/slideshow-hp-ceo-stock-performance.html?s=image_gallery\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>plunged by nearly half</u></a> during her tenure and <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2005/02/09/technology/hp_fiorina/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>rose again</u></a> after she was fired.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HP had $42.4 billion in revenues and $3.1 billion in net earnings <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/14/business/fi-51457\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>in 1999</u></a>. When Fiorina was ousted in 2005, yes, the company reported $86.7 billion in sales. But that year HP had only <a href=\"http://washingtontechnology.com/toplists/top-100-lists/2007/41.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$2.4 billion in earnings</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, the employee head count gets a bit complicated.&nbsp;According to SEC filings, HP had 84,400 employees worldwide in 2001, the year before the merger. In 2001, Compaq had 63,700 full-time employees. That comes to a total of 148,100 workers. In 2005, just after her departure, HP&#39;s worldwide workforce reached 150,000. That includes acquiring some other companies, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some <a href=\"http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_14922854?nclick_check=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>analysts</u></a> have seen the merger more favorably in recent years, noting that it accomplished Fiorina&rsquo;s goal of increasing HP&rsquo;s share of the personal computer market even though Fiorina&rsquo;s execution failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiorina &quot;is taking credit for something she launched and got started,&quot; Charles House, co-author of <em>The HP Phenomenon,</em> told the <em>San Jose Mercury News</em> in <a href=\"http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_14922854?nclick_check=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2011</u></a>. &quot;But I think you obviously have to give a hell of a lot of credit to (her successor) for making it successful. I&#39;d be loath to say it would be the same with her there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiorina said that while she was CEO of HP, the size of the company &quot;doubled.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s correct when discussing one specific aspect, revenues, but you could argue that&#39;s a bit of a red herring.&nbsp;The revenue growth&nbsp;was largely thanks&nbsp;to a controversial&nbsp;merger with Compaq and not organic. Moreover, the new revenue&nbsp;did not come with proportional increases to either profits or the number of HP&nbsp;jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiorina&rsquo;s figures are accurate, but standing alone, they don&rsquo;t tell the whole picture. We rate her claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-05-10T10:45:41.580763", "ruling_date": "2015-05-10T17:15:56", "ruling_headline": "Carly Fiorina fights back against HP layoff claims, says she doubled size of company", "ruling_headline_slug": "carly-fiorina-fights-back-against-hp-layoff-claims", "ruling_link_text": "Revenue grew, but profits fell", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>NBC, <em>Meet the Press</em>, May 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hewlett-Packard, <a href=\"http://h30261.www3.hp.com/financial/sec-filings/hp-sec-filings.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>SEC filings</u></a>, accessed May 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Fortune</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2011/08/21/why-carlys-big-bet-is-failing-fortune-classics-2005/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Why Carly&#39;s big bet is failing</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 7, 2005</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stanford Business Insights, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/compaq-hp-ultimately-urge-merge-was-right\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Compaq and HP: Ultimately, the Urge to Merge Was Right</u></a>,&quot; June 1, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stanford University, Closer Look Series, &quot;Leadership Challenges at Hewlett-Packard,&quot; October 11, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>San Jose Mercury News</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_14922854?nclick_check=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Analysts: Carly Fiorina long on vision, fell short on execution at HP,</u></a>&quot; April 20, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/04/business/hewlett-packard-in-deal-to-buy-compaq-for-25-billion-in-stock.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hewlett-Packard in Deal to Buy Compaq for $25 Billion in Stock,</u></a>&quot; Sept. 4, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg View, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-05-05/the-carly-fiorina-leadership-file\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Carly Fiorina Leadership File</u></a>&quot; May 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Wall Street Journal</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/video/presidential-hopeful-carly-fiorina-mixed-record-as-ceo/C0377C1E-A6A0-4CD7-92AF-0478513F3D8E.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Presidential Hopeful Carly Fiorina&#39;s Mixed Record as CEO</u></a>,&quot; May 5, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2015/05/08/carly-fiorinas-misleading-claims-about-her-business-record/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Carly Fiorina&rsquo;s misleading claims about her business record,</u></a>&quot; May 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Los Angeles Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/20/local/la-me-fiorina-20100520\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Profits may not equal success</u></a>,&quot; May 20, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Carly for America spokeswoman Leslie Shedd, May 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, &nbsp;Stephen Morrissette, University of Chicago business professor, May 10, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Carly", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "California", "id": 428, "last_name": "Fiorina", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "carly-fiorina", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Fiorina_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/428/", "total_count": 23, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://carlyforca.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;We doubled the size of the company (Hewlett-Packard).&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "comments on NBC's \"Meet the Press\"", "statement_date": "2015-05-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
