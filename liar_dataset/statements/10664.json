He can&rsquo;t be president.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Constitutional provision</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That comment would have been of a piece with inaccurate &quot;birther&quot; charges about the Democratic president, who was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in August 1961 to an American mother and Kenyan father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At issue is the constitutional provision requiring any president to be a &quot;natural born citizen&quot; of the United States--meaning the person must be a citizen at birth, most legal experts concur. The candidate also must be 35 years of age and a U.S. resident for 14 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does it mean to be a &quot;natural born citizen&quot;? Most legal experts contend it means someone is a citizen from birth and doesn&rsquo;t have to go through a naturalization process to become one. And if that&rsquo;s the definition, then Cruz is a natural born citizen by being born to an American mother and having her citizenship at birth. (See a full rundown of Cruz&rsquo;s eligibility in <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/mar/26/ted-cruz-born-canada-eligible-run-president-update/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>this updated PolitiFact story</u></a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cruz flip-flop?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Facebook post, making the case for Cruz&rsquo;s flip-flop, says Cruz said March 23, 2015, the day he announced his presidential candidacy: &quot;All you need to know about my parentage is my mother was a citizen. My father and place of birth are irrelevant.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Hypocrite!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No confirmation of either comment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Except, ahem, an extensive search of the Nexis news database and online news sources yields no sign of Cruz, a Houston lawyer elected to the Senate in 2012, making <em>either </em>statement<em>. </em>Our searches led us only to a <a href=\"http://debunkr.net/category/politics/ted-cruz/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>March 26, 2015, web post</u></a> on Debunkr.net saying the same; Cruz hasn&rsquo;t made these comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Cruz&rsquo;s campaign if Cruz had ever said Obama couldn&rsquo;t be president for anything connected to his birthplace. He &quot;has not,&quot; Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In news stories dating from 2013 to the present, <em>Dallas Morning News </em>reporter <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/todd-j-gillman/\">Todd J. Gillman</a>, who heads that paper&rsquo;s Washington, D.C., bureau, has detailed Cruz&rsquo;s citizenship actions including a decision to legally end his dual U.S.-Canada citizenship in June 2014. At the time, Cruz made his birth certificate available to reporters:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kG0V00lYwnKA1YCMQCt9Qys6PYsKGTpKTegSN8MF7_rFPr6GmNFIiLhY_GGggikAmV3fKhiKElrPcH4AYwYGHuvBWfAG0ou6mBH-VXPNphGsSr2EyD3rEYppZQa6AIO7l8PUD98\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:488px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SOURCE: </strong><em>Email, Catherine Frazier, then-press secretary, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, to Jonathan Tilove, chief political writer, Austin American-Statesman, Aug. 19, 2013</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, Gillman took note of a Mother Jones magazine article stating Cruz&rsquo;s father, Dallas-area pastor Rafael Cruz, had made a comment while stumping for his son that suggested Obama be sent back to Kenya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2012, the elder Cruz spoke of sending Obama &quot;back to Kenya.&quot; That&#39;s the land of birth for Obama&#39;s father, the <em>News</em> noted in a Nov. 1, 2013, news story, though the 44th president was born in Hawaii, &quot;making him a natural-born American two ways -- by birth on American soil and because his mother was from Kansas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have our work cut out for us,&quot; the elder Cruz told a North Texas Tea Party gathering Sept. 12, 2012, as later revealed by Mother Jones. &quot;We need to send Barack Obama back to Chicago. I&#39;d like to send him back to Kenya, back to Indonesia.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, Frazier said the pastor did not speak for his son. <a href=\"http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2013/11/texas-sen-ted-cruz-said-fathers-remark-about-sending-president-obama-back-to-kenya-was-a-joke.html/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Ted Cruz subsequently</u></a> said his father made an &quot;ill-advised joke,&quot; the <em>News</em> reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Facebook meme indicates Ted Cruz has conveniently flip-flopped on whether the president must be U.S.-born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no evidence Cruz made the presented comments or that he&rsquo;s changed his position about the &quot;natural born citizen&quot; provision.
