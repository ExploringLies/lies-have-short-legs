During that campaign, Romney supported two gun control measures: the Brady Bill, which required background checks for gun purchases, and a ban on certain types of assault weapons.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 2002, Romney ran for governor, successfully beating Shannon P. O'Brien. During that campaign Romney said, \"We have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them. &hellip; I won't chip away at them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Also during the 1994 race, Kennedy attacked Romney as a conservative similar to Ronald Reagan. (He didn't mean it as a compliment.) That's when Romney responded, \"I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Romney made his most detailed defenses to these apparent flip-flops in an interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS News'\n <i>\n  Face the Nation\n </i>\n on Oct. 21, 2007.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the gun issue, Romney said, \"I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. ... But my positions are the same as my positions have been with regards to guns for a long, long time, and that is that I respect the right of people to bear arms, and whether that's for hunting or personal protection. I sought the support of the NRA when I ran for governor, and I got it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n On his Reagan comment: \"Well, when I was running in '94 I wasn't trying to return to Reagan-Bush because that was characterized as a very different posture than what I was running for. &hellip; And Senator Kennedy in the debate was saying, `Oh, you're just turning yourself into Reagan-Bush.' I said, `No, I'm my own person.'\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Romney's explanations not withstanding, the sly TV from the Log Cabin Republicans accurately portrays his positions from previous races. Could the group have made it clear that Romney's statements today have a different tenor? Yes. But we still find the substance of their statements correct, so we give them a Mostly True.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:34.082709", "ruling_date": "2007-10-24T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Romney supported gun control in previous runs", "ruling_headline_slug": "romney-supported-gun-control-in-previous-runs", "ruling_link_text": "Romney supported gun control in previous runs", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "The Log Cabin Republicans,\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elx3UWmyAY4\">\n \"Romney's Real Record,\"\n</a>\nOct. 4, 2007.\n<p>\n The Boston Globe,\n <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/04/05/romneys_record_on_guns_questioned/\">\n  Romney's record on guns questioned,\n </a>\n April 5, 2007.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Boston Globe,\n <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/02/19/romney_joined_nra_in_august/\">\n  Romney joins NRA in August; was advocate of gun control,\n </a>\n Feb. 19, 2007.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Boston Herald, Key promises looming large, Nov. 10, 2002.\n</p>\n<p>\n Face the Nation,\n <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/21/ftn/main3389333.shtml\">\n  Transcript\n </a>\n , Oct. 21, 2007.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 28, "last_name": "Log Cabin Republicans", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "log-cabin-republicans", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-logcabinrepublicans_.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/28/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "\"Mitt Romney opposed the gun lobby, even Ronald Reagan.\"", "statement_context": "", "statement_date": "2007-10-04", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 19, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/19/", "subject": "Guns", "subject_slug": "guns", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
