So it was with some astonishment that PolitiFact Oregon heard that President Barack Obama was trying to make it more expensive for people to buy holiday trees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-obama-christmas-tree-tax-20111109,0,6514612.story?track=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+latimes%2Fnews%2Fpolitics+%28L.A.+Times+-+Politics%29\">&quot;Is President Obama &#39;the Grinch who taxed Christmas&#39; trees?</a>&quot; queried a headline on the Los Angeles Times website. A Republican congressman from Louisiana issued a press release, slamming the Democratic president for trying to <a href=\"http://scalise.house.gov/press-release/scalise-vows-block-new-tax-christmas-trees\">&quot;sneak through this new tax on Christmas trees.&quot; </a>By the end of Nov. 9, 2011, the conservative Heritage Foundation had logged more than 2,000 comments on its blog post, &quot;<a href=\"http://blog.heritage.org/2011/11/08/obama-couldnt-wait-his-new-christmas-tree-tax/\">Obama Couldn&rsquo;t Wait: His New Christmas Tree </a><a href=\"http://blog.heritage.org/2011/11/08/obama-couldnt-wait-his-new-christmas-tree-tax/\">Tax</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLocally, we spotted a Multnomah County GOP retweet of the Republican National Committee: &quot;Obama admin creates new tax on Christmas tree farms, fees get passed onto the consumer.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat in the name of Rudolph and Frosty and the Polar Express was going on?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOregon is the No. 1 grower of Christmas firs and pine, harvesting more than 7 million trees. (That&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.nwtrees.com/choose_and_cutframe.htm\">twice the haul of No. 2 North Carolina</a>.) &nbsp;Was the president seriously imposing a new &quot;tax&quot; that might make our holidays a little less ho-ho-ho?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs it happens, a <a href=\"http://www.christmastree.org/11_PR7.pdf\">national fresh tree group </a>had sought the 15-cent tree assessment to better promote its products. It&rsquo;s a <a href=\"http://www.hardwoodcheckoff.org/pdf/checkoffBrochure.pdf\">&quot;checkoff program&quot;</a>much like the ones already in place for beef <a href=\"http://www.beefitswhatsfordinner.com/\">(&quot;it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s for dinner&quot;)</a>and pork <a href=\"http://www.porkbeinspired.com/Index.aspx?pid=google\">(&quot;the other white meat&quot;)</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Agriculture Department approved the idea. The Internet exploded. By the end of the day, the White House had decided to re-assess. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBetty Malone, an Oregon tree farmer who heads up the <a href=\"http://christmastreepromotion.com/\">Christmas Tree Promotion Now </a>campaign, said she was stunned anyone would describe the tree fee as something dreamed up by the president. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s absurd. We&rsquo;ve been working on this for three-and-a-half years. The industry has talked about this for 20 years,&quot; Malone said. &quot;This started long before Obama&quot; was in the White House.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be fair, not everyone in the industry embraces the idea, although the <a href=\"http://www.christmastree.org/releases.cfm\">National Christmas Tree Association </a>reports the majority of responses to the proposed program were positive.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWould the fee be passed on to consumers? That&rsquo;s unclear, said Bryan Ostlund, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.nwtrees.com/\">Pacific Northwest Christmas Tree Association</a>. &quot;It doesn&rsquo;t get automatically passed along, but somebody along the line has to cover it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tFinally, there&rsquo;s the question of whether the 15-cent assessment is actually a &quot;tax.&quot; The federal government monitors the agricultural marketing board that administers the money, but the revenue doesn&rsquo;t go to government. Rick Dungey, spokesman for the national tree association, <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/11/tree_farmers_blast_sinister_smear_of_obamas_christmas_tree_tax.php\">insists it is not a tax</a>. (He also says consumers should not see a difference in tree prices.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Oregon, at least, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2011/feb/13/mark-daniels/mark-daniels-says-oregons-proposed-paper-bag-fee-t/\">revenue has to go into the general treasury </a>in order to be considered a tax. If the government doesn&rsquo;t touch the money, even though government mandates it, the assessment is neither a tax nor a fee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we digress. We&rsquo;re talking about the federal government. Let&rsquo;s turn to federal sources, with the help of national PolitiFact.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It certainly doesn&#39;t smell or quack like a tax,&quot; said Robert Litan, the vice president for Research and Policy at the <a href=\"http://www.kauffman.org/\">Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation </a>and a former associate director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the other hand, Dan Mitchell, an economist with the <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/people/daniel-mitchell\">Cato Institute</a>, says &quot;a coercive levy is a tax.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe also checked with Stephen Bell, communications director for U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, the Louisiana congressman who vowed to block Obama&rsquo;s sneaky tree tax, and Sean Spicer, an RNC spokesman. It didn&rsquo;t matter to either of them that industry had sought the assessment or that industry was denying it&rsquo;s a tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who asked for it,&quot; said Bell. &quot;It&rsquo;s at the sole discretion of the Obama administration to impose a tax, and they decided to impose this 15-cent tree tax.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis is a tax, added Spicer, because &quot;it&rsquo;s not voluntary. It&rsquo;s not a contribution to a cause.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, where does that leave us? Sources appear split on whether this truly is a tax and whether the cost would be passed along to consumers. As for the claim that Obama created this new tax, that suggests that he came up with the program -- when it&rsquo;s clear the idea preceded his presidency and originated with the industry.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose are pretty big facts to ignore. So we rate the claim Mostly False: The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2011/11/president_obama_wants_to_tax_c.html\">Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-09T22:42:18.458257", "ruling_date": "2011-11-09T19:38:19", "ruling_headline": "Republicans, bloggers needle Obama for creating new tax on Christmas trees - true?
