The fake first-person narrative reads: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;Naysayers claim the ACA will turn our nation&rsquo;s emergency rooms into those similar to Europe&rsquo;s, where people can sit all day in understaffed hospitals as they wait to get their feverish illnesses addressed, or their broken limbs fixed, their convulsions stopped, that knife removed from their skulls, or their fingers reattached.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>I doubt such dire fears will ever come true here. &nbsp;&nbsp;But for argument&rsquo;s sake let us presume I am wrong (which I never am) and that &#39;&rsquo;Obamacare&#39;&rsquo; will force Americans to wait in emergency rooms longer than they already do. &nbsp;In that case, has it ever occurred to people the great new friends that can be made while waiting for hours in abject misery alongside others also in abject pain and misery?&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pelosi, like most of her party, consistently supports Obamacare. And hey, she may also support making new friends. But there&rsquo;s no evidence to suggest that she twisted potentially longer emergency room wait times into a good thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook posts quoted Pelosi as saying, &quot;Waiting long hours in the emergency room will allow you to make new friends!&quot; We quickly traced back the claims to a satirical article. Pelosi never actually said this, or anything remotely similar.
