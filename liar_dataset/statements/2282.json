If you cut out the introductory clauses, it gets down to about 15 seconds. Either way, it&rsquo;s not 10.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Lynch makes five claims, not three. Let&#39;s take a look at them, point by point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKeep in mind that we&#39;re fact-checking Gemma&#39;s statement. But to do so, we need to check what Lynch said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t1) Gemma has not been &quot;involved&quot; in politics. We can&#39;t evaluate this one, because it&#39;s a subjective comment, not a fact.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t2)&nbsp; Gemma was &quot;not even registered to vote as recently as a few years ago.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGemma told us he first registered in Providence many years ago, moving his registration to Cumberland when he relocated there in the 1990s, before moving again, to Lincoln, in 2004.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Cumberland Board of Canvassers has a record showing Gemma registered to vote there in 1998. In Lincoln, town records show Gemma has been registered to vote since 2004 and voted in the November 2004, 2006 and 2008 elections.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt was difficult to verify Gemma&#39;s entire registration history, in part because of record-keeping problems at the boards of canvassers and the move from paper to computer records.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we verified that Gemma has been registered for at least six years, so Lynch&#39;s second claim is false.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t3) Gemma &quot;didn&rsquo;t bother to vote in the last crucial presidential election.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Lynch team now says it was referring to Gemma&#39;s failure to vote in the March 2008 presidential primary. But the Lincoln Board of Canvassers and the secretary of state&#39;s office both confirm that Gemma voted in the November 2008 general election. So Lynch is wrong on that one too. (For the record, we asked Gemma whom he voted for, and he said Barack Obama.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t4)&nbsp; Gemma &quot;has only been a Democrat for a couple of months.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRecords from Lincoln and the secretary of state show that Gemma registered as a Democrat in May 2010 -- the month before he announced his candidacy for Congress. Prior to that, he was registered as unaffiliated since 2004.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked Gemma why he accused Lynch of lying about this fact, he insisted he has &quot;always been a Democrat&quot; even if his voter registration doesn&#39;t indicate so. He can call himself whatever he wants, but his official designation tells a different story. Therefore, Lynch&#39;s claim is true.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t5)&nbsp; &quot;Really [Gemma&rsquo;s] only involvement in the governmental process in Rhode Island has been to support Governor Carcieri.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGemma&rsquo;s campaign finance reports show that in recent years he gave about $3,000 to a small group of candidates. Carcieri received the largest sum: $1,000, almost a third of the total. But Gemma also donated to U.S. Rep. James Langevin, Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts and former Providence Mayor Joseph Paolino, a developer. So Lynch&#39;s claim is false.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow let&rsquo;s get back to Gemma&#39;s original accusation: &quot;Bill Lynch told three lies in ten seconds.&quot; As we know there were five statements -- of which we checked four -- and it was at least 15 seconds, not 10.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we&rsquo;re not sure how Gemma did his timing. His explanation: if you take any three of these claims they&rsquo;ll add up to 10 seconds. That&#39;s very creative timekeeping.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we understand we&#39;re nitpicking. So let&rsquo;s look at the more substantive part of the claim. Three of the four factual accusations Lynch made were wrong. Whether they were lies or misstatements is for someone other than PolitiFact to decide.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRemember though, we&rsquo;re ruling on what Gemma said, not Lynch&#39;s accuracy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile Lynch&rsquo;s claims might have warranted a check, Gemma trumped them by putting out a news release that was intended to be provocative. Instead of just pointing out Lynch&rsquo;s inaccuracies, he called him a liar and he cited a precise time frame. Neither point was completely right and Gemma deserves to be called out on that. But the meat of what Gemma said about his opponent&#39;s accusations was correct.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we&rsquo;ll give him a Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-25T16:37:31.860063", "ruling_date": "2010-08-26T00:01:00", "ruling_headline": "Gemma says Bill Lynch \"told three lies in ten seconds\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "gemma-says-bill-lynch-told-three-lies-10-seconds", "ruling_link_text": "Start the stopwatch", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.anthonygemmaforcongress.com/newsroom_view.php?id=59\">Gemma for Congress website</a>, &quot;Anthony Gemma&#39;s Enough is Enough Initiative: Bill Lynch told three lies in 10 seconds,&quot; news release posted on website and mailed to news media, Aug. 19, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.630wpro.com/Article.asp?id=1921533&amp;spid=\">Video: WPRO Congressional District 1 Debate</a>, 05:49 - 06:12 minutes, Aug. 18, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview and emails, Anthony Gemma, Democratic candidate for Congress, District 1, and staff, Aug. 20, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview and emails, Bill Fischer and Devin Driscoll, campaign staff for Bill Lynch, Democratic candidate for Congress, District 1, Aug. 20, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, City of Providence Board of Canvassers, Aug. 20, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Town of Cumberland Board of Canvassers, Aug. 20, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Town of Lincoln Clerk, Aug. 20, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Secretary of State A.
