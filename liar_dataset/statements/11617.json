A nondenominational Protestant, Obama has worshipped at various churches in the Washington area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, and St. John&#39;s Episcopal Church. He has also attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should also note that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/26/18-percent-american-public/obama-muslim-no-hes-not-evidence-has-not-changed/\">segments of the public</a> have long told pollsters that they think Obama is a Muslim. In 2010, a Pew Research Center survey found that 18 percent of Americans said that Obama is a Muslim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found two polls in recent months that asked a question along these same lines:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, Sept. 4-8, 2015</strong>. The pollsters <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/09/12/iranpoll.pdf\">asked</a>, &quot;Do you happen to know what religion Barack Obama is? Is he Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Mormon, Muslim, something else, or not religious?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among all respondents, 29 percent said Obama is &quot;Muslim.&quot; While that&rsquo;s 11 percentage points higher than Pew had found five years earlier, it&rsquo;s still not as high as the 59 percent figure Iftikhar cited on <em>Meet the Press</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The percentage was higher for Republicans alone -- 43 percent thought Obama is Muslim, compared with 15 percent of Democrats and 29 percent of independents. CNN/ORC surveyed 1,012 adult Americans by landline and cell phones, for a sampling margin of error of 3 percentage points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Public Policy Polling poll, Aug. 28-30, 2015</strong>. The pollsters <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_National_90115.pdf\">asked</a>, &quot;Do you think Barack Obama is a Christian or a Muslim, or are you not sure?&quot; Public Policy Polling only asked &quot;usual Republican primary voters&quot; -- 572 of them -- this question. The automated survey was conducted by landline and the Internet, with a sampling margin of error of just over 4 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey found that 54 percent of the Republican primary electorate thought Obama is a Muslim, compared with just 14 percent who thought he is Christian and 32 percent who said they didn&rsquo;t know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So with this survey, we reach a number within striking distance of Iftikhar&rsquo;s Meet the Press statistic -- but it just describes the views of &quot;usual Republican primary voters,&quot; which is only one subset of &quot;Americans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we reached out to Iftikhar, he quickly and good-naturedly copped to mangling his talking point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You are correct,&quot; he wrote via email. &quot;I did mean Republicans from the PPP poll. Nobody is perfect :-)&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iftikhar said that &quot;59 percent of Americans today believe that Barack Obama is still a Muslim.&quot; He later acknowledged to PolitiFact that he&rsquo;d meant to say &quot;Republicans&quot; instead of &quot;Americans,&quot; a switch that would have made his claim closer to accurate (though still a bit high according to recent polls). In any case, PolitiFact fact-checks statements as they were made originally and to the widest audience, so we rate the statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-23T14:44:19.450918", "ruling_date": "2015-11-23T16:46:53", "ruling_headline": "Do 59 percent of Americans believe Barack Obama is Muslim?", "ruling_headline_slug": "do-59-percent-americans-believe-barack-obama-musli", "ruling_link_text": "The figure is close for base Republicans, but not all Americans", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Arsalan Iftikhar, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-november-22-2015-n467821\">comments</a> on NBC&rsquo;s Meet the Press, Nov. 22, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public Policy Polling, <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_National_90115.pdf\">national survey</a>, Aug. 28-30, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN/ORC, <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/09/12/iranpoll.pdf\">national survey</a>, Sept. 4-8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/09/14/a-startling-number-of-americans-still-believe-president-obama-is-a-muslim/\">A startling number of Americans still believe President Obama is a Muslim</a>,&quot; Sept. 14, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/01/breaking-54-of-republicans-think-president-obama-is-a-muslim-but-probably-not/\">No, a majority of Republicans don&rsquo;t think President Obama is a Muslim</a>,&quot; Sept. 1, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Examiner</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/why-are-americans-confused-about-obamas-religion/article/2560534\">Why are Americans confused about Obama&#39;s religion?</a>&quot; Feb. 22, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Arsalan Iftikhar, Nov. 23, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Senior editor, Islamic Monthly magazine ", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Arsalan ", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Washington, D.C.", "id": 3340, "last_name": "Iftikhar", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "arsalan-iftikhar", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Iftikhar_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3340/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.themuslimguy.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;59 percent of Americans today believe that Barack Obama is still a Muslim.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a roundtable discussion on NBC's \"Meet the Press\"", "statement_date": "2015-11-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 130, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/130/", "subject": "Diversity", "subject_slug": "diversity", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 194, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/194/", "subject": "Polls and Public Opinion", "subject_slug": "polls", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
