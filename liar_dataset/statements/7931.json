We rolled out the Flip-O-Meter to examine the extent of Herring&rsquo;s change. Let&rsquo;s journey back in time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn 2003, Herring unsuccessfully <a href=\"http://www.sbe.state.va.us/ElectionResults/2003/Nov/S_07_027.htm\">ran</a>&nbsp;for the state Senate. He said marriage should be between a man and a woman, according to an Oct. 17 article that year in The Winchester Star.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOn Feb. 2, 2006, Herring was sworn in as a state senator after winning a <a href=\"http://www.sbe.virginia.gov/ElectionResults/2006/Jan2006/Jan_31_06/default.htm\">special election</a> in Loudoun County. Fifteen days later, he <a href=\"http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?061+vot+SV1450HJ0041+HJ0041\">supported</a> a <a href=\"http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?061+sum+HJ41\">resolution</a> allowing Virginia voters to decide whether there should be a state constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. Virginia law already defined marriage as between a man and a woman. But many referendum backers said the added constitutional amendment would shield the traditional marriage law from judicial tampering.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tHerring reiterated his support for the amendment during a Sept. 20, 2006, interview with Leesburg Today, saying it was consistent with Virginia&rsquo;s existing marriage law. In November, the amendment was <a href=\"http://www.sbe.virginia.gov/ElectionResults/2006/Nov/htm/index.htm\">approved</a> by 57 percent of voters.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tHerring sang a different tune this spring during his successful Democratic primary campaign for attorney general.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOn April 5, he released an &quot;<a href=\"http://files.www.herringforag.com/MHAG_Equality_Agenda_Final.pdf\">Equality Agenda</a>&quot; that said, &quot;Mark Herring believes that civil marriage is a fundamental right, and he supports marriage equality for same-gender couples.&quot; Herring pledged to work &quot;to change the current law prohibiting such marriages.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tObenshain, a state senator from Harrisonburg since 2004, has been outspoken in his opposition to gay marriage. During a debate this June 15 with Herring, Obenshain said, &quot;I believe marriage is an institution to be entered into between a man and a woman. That&rsquo;s an issue upon which Mark and I, until at least a few years ago, agreed.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tHerring acknowledged that &quot;almost eight years ago&quot; he &quot;didn&rsquo;t really feel comfortable&quot; about gay marriage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;But since that time, I&rsquo;ve done a lot of thinking about it,&quot; he said. &quot;I&rsquo;ve talked to my friends, my constituents. I talked to co-workers; I talked to my family, including my children. And like millions of Americans and a lot of Virginians, I don&rsquo;t believe that way anymore and I think it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;I don&rsquo;t believe anybody should be treated as a second-class citizen and I don&rsquo;t believe that the state should decide who you can and cannot marry. So I support marriage equality and as we work towards marriage equality, there are very specific things I, as attorney general, can do to help protect the rights of gay and lesbian Virginians.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tFor better or worse, Herring has done a Full Flop.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-06-21T14:30:57.515939", "ruling_date": "2013-06-24T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Mark Herring reverses position on gay marriage", "ruling_headline_slug": "mark-herring-reverses-position-gay-marriage", "ruling_link_text": "Backs same-sex marriage now ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tHerring-Obenshain debate, June 15, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tLegislative Information Service, <a href=\"http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?061+sum+HJ41\">HJ 41</a>, Feb. 17, 2006.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWashington Blade, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/04/05/herring-unveils-lgbt-agenda-gay-virginia/\">Herring unveils LGBT agenda</a>, April 5, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMark Herring for Attorney General, <a href=\"http://files.www.herringforag.com/MHAG_Equality_Agenda_Final.pdf\">An equality agenda</a>, April 5, 2013.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe Winchester Star, Potts-Herring debate story, Oct. 7, 2003.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tLeesburg Today, &quot;Black challenges Democrats to marriage amendment debate,&quot; Sept. 20, 2006.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tVirginia Board of Elections, <a href=\"http://www.sbe.state.va.us/ElectionResults/2003/Nov/S_07_027.htm\">Senate district 27 results</a>, Nov. 4, 2003.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tVirginia Board of Elections, <a href=\"http://www.sbe.virginia.gov/ElectionResults/2006/Jan2006/Jan_31_06/default.htm\">Special election results</a>, Jan. 31, 2006.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "State senator", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Mark", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 2345, "last_name": "Herring", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "mark-herring", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/HERRING.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2345/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.herringforag.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tOn gay marriage</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a debate", "statement_date": "2013-06-15", "statement_type": {"id": 4, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/4/", "statement_type": "Flip", "type_description": "Flip-o-Meter items"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 118, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/118/", "subject": "Gays and Lesbians", "subject_slug": "gays-and-lesbians", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 134, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/134/", "subject": "Marriage", "subject_slug": "marriage", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 159, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/159/", "subject": "Voting Record", "subject_slug": "voting-record", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
