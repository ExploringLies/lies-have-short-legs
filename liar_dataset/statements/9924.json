They have largely disappeared from view since they were dropped off in Doha, but eyewitnesses place Fazi, Wasiq, and Noori in Iraq and Syria fighting with ISIS.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If true, this would be a major story. But it&rsquo;s not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/02/john-mccain/john-mccain-says-five-taliban-detainees-freed-bowe/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>took significant heat</u></a> at the time for releasing the five detainees, with some critics also taking issue with the ex-detainees&rsquo; <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/bowe-bergdahl-released/ex-gitmo-militants-are-free-move-around-qatar-source-n121356\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>new terms of custody</u></a> -- being transferred to the Persian Gulf state of Qatar with restrictions on their political behavior but relative freedom of movement within the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t find any news reports about what the ex-detainees have been up to recently, but we quickly noticed a couple of red flags that made us suspicious of the email&rsquo;s claims. For starters, the claim in politicalears.com is entirely unsourced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, we&rsquo;d run into politicalears.com before and found the site less than credible. Earlier this month, we looked at its claim that &quot;over 73 percent of all donations raised&quot; from the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge &quot;are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations.&quot; We gave it a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/02/blog-posting/bloggers-incorrectly-blast-als-ice-bucket-challeng/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Pants on Fire</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts who study the region told us the claim was wrong. The ex-detainees &quot;are all in Qatar. This is nonsense,&quot; said Barnett R. Rubin, director and senior fellow at New York University&rsquo;s Center on International Cooperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that while he doesn&rsquo;t doubt that the ex-detainees are dangerous to United States interests, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/bowe-bergdahl-released/ex-gitmo-militants-are-free-move-around-qatar-source-n121356\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">there is literally zero evidence</a>&quot; that the detainees have been spotted on the battlefield with ISIS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gartenstein-Ross added that the claim doesn&rsquo;t even make much logical sense and betrays the author&rsquo;s weak grasp on the region&rsquo;s nuances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The ex-detainees &quot;were in the Afghanistan-Pakistan theater,&quot; Gartenstein-Ross said. &quot;Based on these guys&rsquo; social networks and who their points of contact were, it&rsquo;s pretty unlikely they&rsquo;d be able to quickly find a way to the battlefield and have a command&quot; in the Iraq-Syria border region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They are not native Arabic speakers, and it would be unfamiliar terrain culturally. They would face a lot of obstacles,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked the White House if there was any evidence that one or more detainees has joined ISIS, spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said, &quot;There is no truth to these reports.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloggers said that &quot;three of five detainees swapped (for Bowe Bergdahl) are now ISIS leaders.&quot; The claim has nonexistent sourcing, has been published by sites with questionable track records for accuracy, and has been knocked down by independent experts.
