He said that forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was...&quot;; &nbsp;then, to finish the sentence, an audio clip is inserted with Walker saying: &quot;just a cool thing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The reference is to a law Walker signed in July 2013. It requires an ultrasound before getting an abortion. But the woman can choose to receive the ultrasound transabdominally, which is done externally; or transvaginally, which is what NARAL refers to as invasive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/24/emilys-list/scott-walker-forces-some-women-get-transvaginal-ul/\">For some women</a>, though -- in cases of early pregnancy or morbid obesity, for example -- the transvaginal procedure may in effect be required because it is medically necessary.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>&lsquo;Cool thing&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The audio clip used in the ad is from an <a href=\"http://www.971talk.com/blogs/dana-show-blog/audio-demand/scott-walker-dana-show-5-22-15\">interview</a> Walker did May 22, 2015 with <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/dana-loesch/\">Dana Loesch</a>, a conservative radio talk show host in Dallas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">About halfway into a 30-minute interview, there was this exchange about ultrasounds:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Loesch:</strong> What place do social issues have in 2016 and why do you think so many Republican candidates are scared of them -- are scared to embrace them; they&#39;re scared to get trapped by the media?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Walker:</strong> Well, I think a little bit of it is the media is a gotcha; some do at least, I don&#39;t want to say universally. But I think that --</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Loesch:</strong> Oh, most of them do.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Walker:</strong> Yeah. I mean, well, I&#39;ll give you an example. I&#39;m pro-life, I&#39;ve passed pro-life legislation. We defunded Planned Parenthood, we signed a law that requires an ultrasound -- which, the thing about that -- the media tried to make that sound like that was a crazy idea. Most people I talk to, whether they&#39;re pro-life or not -- I find people all the time who&#39;ll get out their iPhone and show me a picture of their grandkids&#39; ultrasound and how excited they are; so that&#39;s a lovely thing. I think about, my sons are 19 and 20 -- you know we still have their first ultrasound picture. It&#39;s just a cool thing out there. We just knew, if we signed that law, if we provided the information, that more people, if they saw that unborn child, would make a decision to protect and keep the life of that unborn child.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Walker&rsquo;s comments led to some contrasting news reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, the headline in the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/05/28/scott-walker-discussing-abortion-says-ultrasounds-are-just-a-cool-thing-out-there/\">Washington Post</a> was: &quot;Scott Walker, discussing abortion, says ultrasounds are &lsquo;just a cool thing out there.&rsquo;&quot; But the headline in the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/27/scott-walker-mandatory-ultrasounds_n_7451948.html\">Huffington Post</a> was: &quot;Scott Walker defends mandatory ultrasounds: they&rsquo;re a &lsquo;cool thing.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Walker did defend mandatory ultrasounds. But what he called cool was the ultrasound technology, not forcing women to get transvaginal ultrasounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">NARAL Pro-Choice America says that Walker &quot;said that forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was &#39;just a cool thing.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Walker did defend the law he signed requiring an ultrasound in order to get an abortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But the &quot;cool&quot; reference wasn&rsquo;t to forcing some women to get vaginal ultrasounds, but rather to the ultrasound technology that produces images from the womb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>More on Scott Walker</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#39;s</em><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\">&nbsp;Scott Walker page</a><em>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-06-24T13:16:02.104260", "ruling_date": "2015-06-24T13:35:42", "ruling_headline": "Did Scott Walker say forced ultrasounds to get an abortion are 'a cool thing'?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-scott-walker-say-forced-vaginal-ultrasounds-ar", "ruling_link_text": "Claim goes beyond what Walker said", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-ad01bb9f-268e-eca9-07ec-281c5921861f\">YouTube, NARAL Pro-Choice America &quot;Crazy Ideas,&quot; <a href=\"http://t.signauxhuit.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJN7t5XX4QsN7MW2BpCFl7fcBw0W8rldLn56dKFGf21rF8j02?t=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWWgFcSBJhnc%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;si=4809925563252736&amp;pi=65051ea8-e95f-4415-a402-08f47f5b26cb\">TV ad</a>, June 18, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, NARAL Pro-Choice America senior campaign director Aniello Alioto, June 20, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, Scott Walker testing the waters committee spokeswoman AshLee Strong, June 24, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/24/emilys-list/scott-walker-forces-some-women-get-transvaginal-ul/\">&quot;EMILY&rsquo;s List: Scott Walker is forcing some women to get transvaginal ultrasounds to get an abortion,&quot;</a> (Half True) Oct. 24, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dana Show, Gov.
