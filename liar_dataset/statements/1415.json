Although many of the issues in the e-mail have  been addressed in previous PolitiFact items, we continue to get queries about  it.<br /><br />So we've decided to visit -- or revisit -- several claims made in the e-mail. In this item, we will address the claim that HR 3200, \"The  Affordable Health Care Choices Act of 2009,\" would provide for \"free abortion  services, and probably forced participation in abortions by members of the  medical profession.\" <br /><br />In the health care debate, abortion coverage has  been a moving target as provisions have changed in various versions of the House  and Senate bills. And we should note that Connelly wrote his e-mail back in  August, long before the bills came to the floors of the two chambers.<br /><br />The  House ultimately passed a health care bill that included an abortion amendment  that essentially renders Connelly's argument moot. Still, Connelly said in an  interview with PolitiFact on Jan. 20, 2010, that the same concerns he raised  about the House bill back in August apply to the version of the health care bill  passed by the Senate.<br /><br />Before we address that, let's back up a step.  Although the original health care reform bills introduced in both the House and  Senate were silent on abortion, the issue came to a head in late July when the  House Energy and Commerce Committee passed an amendment offered by Rep. Lois  Capps, D-Calif., which sought to make abortion coverage available in both the  public plan and in private plans participating in the exchange, but paid  exclusively through patient premiums, not government subsidies. Under that  amendment, insurers would not be required to offer, or be prohibited from  offering, abortion services in order to participate in the exchange. It also  provided \"conscience protections\" so that any insurance plan participating in  the exchange could not discriminate against hospitals or other health care  facilities (such as Catholic hospitals) unwilling to provide abortions.  <br /><br />That was largely the working House plan when Connelly penned his  e-mail. And by that measure, we think Connelly was wrong when he said the bill  would provide free abortions. Insurance purchased through private insurers on  the exchange or the public option would not be \"free.\" In fact, the amendment  required that abortion coverage be paid through premiums paid by the insured.  And Connelly's claim that the bill would probably mean \"forced participation in  abortions by members of the medical profession,\" was specifically prohibited in  \"conscience protection\" measures in the amendment.<br /><br />And that all became  moot in November 2009, when a group of Democrats led by Rep. Bart Stupak of  Michigan forced a vote on an amendment that included tight restrictions barring  any insurance plan that is purchased with government subsidies from covering  abortions. It passed.<br /><br />Connelly said the concerns he raised in his August  e-mail no longer apply to the House bill. But they still apply to the bill that  passed the Senate, he said. The abortion language in the Senate bill is close to  that in the Capps Amendment (though the Senate plan does not include a public  option). As with the earlier House bill, the Senate plan would allow insurance  companies on the exchange to offer abortion services. But for the same reasons  we mentioned about the earlier House plan, we think it's a distortion to  say it would provide \"free abortions.\" And as in the earlier House bill, there  are specific \"conscience protections\" written into the bill that make it clear  doctors could not be discriminated against for opting not to provide abortions.  So under the bill, no doctors would be forced to provide abortions.<br /><br />In  other words, the claim was false when Connelly made it; it's moot  now with regard to the House bill; and it's false with regard to the Senate  bill.<br /><br />In other words, under no version of the plan then or now is  Connelly's statement accurate. And we rate the claim False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-21T16:41:50.731528", "ruling_date": "2010-01-21T17:37:57", "ruling_headline": "Chain e-mail claims House health care bill would provide free abortion", "ruling_headline_slug": "chain-e-mail-claims-house-health-care-bill-would-p", "ruling_link_text": "Abortions paid through premiums, no docs forced to perform them", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Michael Connelly's Web site, <a href=\"http://michaelconnelly.viviti.com/entries/general/the-truth-about-the-health-care-bills\" target=\"_blank\">\"The Truth About the Health Care Bills\"</a></p>\r\n<p>HR 3200, <a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h3200ih.txt.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\"America's Affordable health Choices Act of 2009\"</a></p>\r\n<p>Cornell University Law School, <a href=\"http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution\" target=\"_blank\">The Constitution of the United States of America </a></p>\r\n<p>PolitiFact,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2009/sep/21/baucus-plan-and-abortion-politifact-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\"> \"Abortion and the Baucus health care bill,\"</a> by Robert Farley, Sept. 21, 2009</p>\r\n<p>CNS News, <a href=\"http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/57392\" target=\"_blank\">\"Reid Introduces Senate Health Bill That Mandates Federally Subsidized Abortion,\"</a> by Terence P.
