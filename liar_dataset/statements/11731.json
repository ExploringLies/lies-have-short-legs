Three Republicans joined seven Democrats to approve the measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate resolution was debated on the floor but <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/21/all-actions\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>never came up for a vote</u></a> because a diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons issue surfaced and <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/09/10/remarks-president-address-nation-syria\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Obama asked Congress</u></a> to put off action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, as a former senator and secretary of state, and a budding 2016 presidential candidate, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hillary-clinton-backs-obama-on-syria-strikes/2013/09/09/f697ecc6-196f-11e3-a628-7e6dde8f889d_story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>publicly supported airstrikes</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked about his vote during the Sept. 16, 2015, CNN GOP presidential debate, Rubio said he opposed the action because President Obama &quot;said the attack that he was going to conduct was going to be a pinprick.&quot; PolitiFact ruled that because Obama had repeatedly stated that pinprick attacks were not what he wanted to do, Rubio&#39;s statement was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/sep/18/marco-rubio/obama-called-potential-attack-syria-pinprick-rubio/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>False</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the debate, Rubio added that, &quot;The United States military was not built to conduct pinprick attacks,&quot; and he wanted a strategy that would put &quot;men and women in a position where they can win.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio&nbsp;spokeswoman Brooke Sammon&nbsp;indicated that opposition to those airstrikes doesn&#39;t mean Rubio was opposed to the United States becoming involved in Syria, which Rubio made clear during the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiOgETBVrgc\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Foreign Relations Committee meeting</u></a> where he explained his vote. He predicted that the airstrikes would not work and reiterated his longstanding call for Obama to give arms to the moderate opposition in Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Sept. 18, 2014, when the president asked Congress for approval to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels as part of a larger plan to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/218282-rubio-votes-for-cr-cruz-paul-vote-no\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Rubio voted in favor</u></a> of the proposal, which was part of a larger spending package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hillary-clinton-backs-obama-on-syria-strikes/2013/09/09/f697ecc6-196f-11e3-a628-7e6dde8f889d_story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>advocated arming Syrian rebels</u></a> as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clinton website tries to make Rubio look reluctant to take on Syria or make it look like the senator has flip-flopped, including a quote from Politico that &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/marco-rubio-syria-096232#ixzz3wIUfD5lz\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Rubio was an early advocate of arming the Syrian rebels</u></a>,&quot; and a Politico headline reporting that &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/marco-rubio-the-hawk-turned-dovish-on-syria-in-2013-118229\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Rubio the hawk turned dovish on Syria in 2013</u></a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;Marco Rubio voted against authorizing President Obama to strike Syria after Assad used chemical weapons on his own people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio did vote against the specific resolution for an airstrike campaign, explaining he was &quot;unconvinced it will work.&quot; But he supported a subsequent plan for the United States to help moderate Syrian rebels lead the fight, an idea he had been promoting for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clinton statement suggests a reluctance by Rubio to intervene in Syria when, in fact, it&#39;s the type of involvement that&#39;s at issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is accurate, but needs additional information.
