We must ensure that they have support to adjust to civilian life,&quot; Harris, a Democrat, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris\">said on Twitter</a> on August 18, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/7356583/Kamala%20Harris,%20veterans%20claim.JPG\" style=\"height:177px; width:646px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris made the same claim about veterans suicides on her website <a href=\"http://www.kamalaharris.org/issues/foreign-policy-military-veterans/\">here</a>, where she adds that she&rsquo;ll work &quot;to ensure that every Veteran knows what benefits they earned and how to access those benefits.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether the suicide statistic Harris used is correct. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Checking a somber number</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her campaign spokesman said Harris used a widely-cited figure of 22 suicides per day from the VA&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.va.gov/opa/docs/suicide-data-report-2012-final.pdf\">2012 Suicide Data Report</a>, which examined veterans deaths in 21 states, from 1999 to 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That study&rsquo;s researchers, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/02/04/the-missing-context-behind-a-widely-cited-statistic-that-there-are-22-veteran-suicides-a-day/\">as noted by the Washington Post Fact Checker</a>, cautioned against the use of the 22-deaths figure more than once in the study: &quot;It is recommended that the estimated number of veterans be interpreted with caution due to the use of data from a sample of states.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers gave a range of 18 to 22 veteran suicides a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris chose the high-end of this range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, Harris&rsquo; figure of 22 suicides per day fails to account for research the VA released in July for its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The VA examined about 55 million veterans records from 1979 through 2014. It <a href=\"http://www.va.gov/opa/publications/factsheets/Suicide_Prevention_FactSheet_New_VA_Stats_070616_1400.pdf\">found</a> that in 2014, the latest year for which figures are available, 7,403 veterans took their own lives, or an average of about 20 a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s close to the 22 suicides per day cited by Harris, a figure that continues to be used by many others despite the new, more extensive research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does not take away from the point Harris is trying to make: That the rate of veterans suicide is far too high. VA figures show that in 2014 veterans accounted for <a href=\"http://www.va.gov/opa/publications/factsheets/Suicide_Prevention_FactSheet_New_VA_Stats_070616_1400.pdf\">18 percent of all deaths from suicides</a> among adults in the United States while they made up only 8.5 percent of the population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.capradio.org/media/7356547/Veteran-Medals082216P.jpg\" style=\"height:600px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Capital Public Radio / File photo</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One prominent voice in American politics has cited the new number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Virginia <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2016/jul/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-correctly-says-20-veterans-commit-sui/\">rated a claim</a> by Donald Trump in July that &quot;a shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans,&quot; as True, based on this new report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Virginia added that the VA always acknowledged that this old study (from 2012) was limited. Notably absent were records for California and Texas &mdash; two states with very high veteran populations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new figure of 20 veteran suicides a day is based on records from every state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked, Harris&rsquo; campaign spokesman acknowledged there has been new research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Kamala believes strongly we must work hard to get that number to zero,&quot; the spokesman added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Old study widely cited</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris is not the only person to cite the 22 suicides per day statistic from the old study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her opponent and fellow Democrat in the race for U.S. Senate &mdash; U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez &mdash; has repeated it, including in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2blHI0XvuTU\">video</a> posted in November 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kamala Harris recently said &quot;22 veterans take their own lives each day.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number she cites relies on data from a 2012 VA study by the VA, which was limited and included caveats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That old report&nbsp;has been widely cited by Republicans and Democrats, including Harris&rsquo; opponent in her run for U.S. Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Harris&rsquo; claim ignores research the VA released in July for its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides, with records from all states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new study found an average of about 20 veterans a day, two fewer than what Harris claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris&rsquo;
