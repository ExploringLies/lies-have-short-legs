He then sought a pardon so he could become a police officer, but was turned down. Circosta did not return a phone call from PolitiFact this week, but Huckabee's description of the case is supported by accounts in the Associated Press and other publications.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"Now, I would have given that kid a pardon,\" Huckabee said about Circosta in a Fox News Channel interview on Dec. 20. \"And everywhere I've gone and asked people for a show of hands, everybody agrees with me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Romney refused all pardon requests in his four years as governor. \"I didn't pardon anybody as governor because I didn't want to overturn a jury,\" he said during a June 2007 debate.\n</p>\n<p>\n When he was asked about his policy in December 2007, Romney replied \"We looked at the cases one by one and I did not want to provide commutations to people who had weapons violations that were going to be asking to use weapons in their new capacity.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n He told reporters that the only reasons he would have issued a pardon or commutation would have been if he found evidence that proved a wrongful conviction, prosecutorial misconduct or errors in the judicial process.\n</p>\n<p>\n &nbsp;\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:28.714974", "ruling_date": "2007-12-28T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Romney refused to pardon soldier - and everyone else", "ruling_headline_slug": "romney-refused-to-pardon-soldier-and-everyo", "ruling_link_text": "Romney refused to pardon soldier - and everyone else", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n CNN,\n <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0706/05/se.01.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Transcript of June 5 Republican debate\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Associated Press,\n <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/12/AR2007061201176.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Gov.
