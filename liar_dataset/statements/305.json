During an Oct. 8, 2007, speech in Iowa, she complained that New York apple growers had failed to gain access to Canadian markets while Canadian growers were having no such problems exporting their products to the United States, and blamed the Bush administration for not vigorously enforcing trade agreements.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"I think it is time that we assess trade agreements every five years to make sure they're meeting their goals or make adjustments if they are not and we should start with doing that with NAFTA,\" Clinton said.\n</p>\n<p>\n The line attributed to Clinton about NAFTA being a \"boon\" to the economy appears to be based on an issues rundown in the Sept. 11, 2006, edition of\n <i>\n  Newsday\n </i>\n in which the Long Island newspaper, in its own words, stated that Clinton believed the trade agreement to be a boon to the economy.  The paper also pointed out that Clinton voted against the Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement in 2005 because of concerns that it would drive jobs overseas.\n</p>\n<p>\n Since announcing her candidacy, Clinton has, in fact, tried to distance herself from some of the free-trade policies her husband's administration pursued and repeatedly expressed concern and skepticism about the benefits of globalization.\n</p>\n<p>\n In June 2007, she said NAFTA had some positive effects \"but unfortunately it had a lot of downside.\" And at a debate in December 2007, she announced her intention to review and reform NAFTA if she were elected.\n</p>\n<p>\n Obama implies Clinton views NAFTA as an unqualified success, but more importantly, he attributes words to her that only appear in a newspaper summary of the issues. We judge his statement to be False.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:25.666129", "ruling_date": "2008-01-22T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "No evidence she said that", "ruling_headline_slug": "no-evidence-she-said-that", "ruling_link_text": "No evidence she said that", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Newsday,  \"SPINCYCLE: Newsday's guide to politics and politicians,\" by Michael Rothfeld and Rick Brand, Sept. 11, 2006\n<p>\n U.S. Senate,\n <a href=\"http://senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00209\">\n  H.R. 3045,\n </a>\n CAFTA-DR Vote, July 28, 2005\n</p>\n<p>\n MSNBC,\n <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19311872/\">\n  AFSCME Leadership Forum,\n </a>\n June 19, 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n Bloomberg.com,\n <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20670001&amp;refer=politics&amp;sid=atUKcP4eSEvY\">\n  \"Clinton Breaks With Husband's Legacy on NAFTA Pact, China Trade,\"\n </a>\n by Kristin Jensen and Mark Drajem, March 30, 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n Hillary Clinton,\n <a href=\"http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/speech/view/?id=3626\">\n  Hillary Clinton's Economic Blueprint for the 21st Century,\n </a>\n speech in Iowa, Oct. 8, 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "\"I know that Hillary on occasion has said &mdash; just last year said this (NAFTA) was a boon to the economy.\"", "statement_context": "a debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C.", "statement_date": "2008-01-21", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
