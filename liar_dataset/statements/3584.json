Douthat said Israel and Egypt receive more foreign aid from Uncle Sam than any other nations. We rated that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/04/ross-douthat/egypt-got-more-foreign-aid-anyone-besides-israel-s/\">True</a>, noting that if you exclude the spending on Afghanistan and Iraq, where military operations continue, Israel received $2.4 billion in the 2008 fiscal year, while Egypt got $1.5 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose 2008 figures came from the U.S. Census 2011 Statistical Abstract. The United States spent a total $49.1 billion on foreign aid that year. According to the Treasury Department and historical tables on the federal budget, total federal spending was $2.98 trillion for the 2008 fiscal year. That means foreign aid made up 1.64 percent of budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about 2009? In that fiscal year, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development, the United States spent $44.9 billion, while overall government spending was $3.52 trillion. Foreign aid spending was 1.28 percent of the total budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you&rsquo;re wondering who else is a major U.S. aid recipient, here&rsquo;s the rest of the top 10 from 2008: Russia ($1.3 billion), Sudan ($1.2 billion), Tanzania ($1.1 billion), Ethiopia ($1 billion), Pakistan ($963 million), Colombia ($888 million), Jordan ($833 million), and Mozambique ($799 million). The totals reflect both economic and military aid.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Obama was almost exactly right in saying foreign aid consumes about 1 percent of the U.S. budget. In fiscal 2008 U.S. foreign aid spending of $49.1 billion made up 1.64 percent of total spending. The next year foreign aid spending was $44.9 billion, or 1.28 percent of the total budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the president&rsquo;s statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-13T16:46:08.944914", "ruling_date": "2011-04-13T16:45:30", "ruling_headline": "Barack Obama says foreign aid makes up 1 percent of U.S. budget", "ruling_headline_slug": "barack-obama-says-foreign-aid-makes-1-percent-us-b", "ruling_link_text": "He's got it right", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPresident Barack Obama, Speech on national debt, <a href=\"http://projects.washingtonpost.com/obama-speeches/speech/622/\">transcript</a>, April 13, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau,<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/foreign_commerce_aid/foreign_aid.html\">The 2011 Statistical Abstract</a>, Foreign Commerce &amp; Aid: Foreign Aid, U.S. Foreign Economic and Military Aid by Major Recipient Country, accessed Feb. 3, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. AID, U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants,<a href=\"https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AmV2WzM6u9XYdEdIakYteWdfWEUzQlJ0M1ozVDNsNkE&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CPP_yv8L\">U.S. Total Economic and Military Assistance to the World, FY1982-FY2009</a>, Feb. 3, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGovernment Printing Office,<a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy11/hist.html\">Budget of the United States Government: Historical tables</a>, accessed Feb. 17, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2011/feb/17/scott-rigell/rep-scott-rigell-says-united-states-borrows-more-4/\">Rep.
