Right now, American oil production is the highest that it&rsquo;s been in eight years. That&rsquo;s right &ndash; eight years. Not only that &ndash; last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past sixteen years.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis passage includes a number of claims, but here we&rsquo;ll focus on the one that &quot;right now, American oil production is the highest that it&rsquo;s been in eight years.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe looked at a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-oil-production-last-year-was-/\">similar </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-oil-production-last-year-was-/\">claim</a> on&nbsp;March 15, 2011, and rated it Mostly True. But we will update our assessment based on new data.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government&rsquo;s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said &quot;oil production,&quot; we will only look at crude oil extracted from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere are the <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS1&amp;f=A\">annual totals</a>, in barrels produced, going back to 2003:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t2003: 2,073,453,000<br />\r\n\t2004: 1,983,302,000<br />\r\n\t2005: 1,890,106,000<br />\r\n\t2006: 1,862,259,000<br />\r\n\t2007: 1,848,450,000<br />\r\n\t2008: 1,811,817,000<br />\r\n\t2009: 1,956,596,000<br />\r\n\t2010: 1,998,137,000</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe full-year data is available only through 2010, but <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS1&amp;f=M\">10 months of data</a> from 2011 have been made public. Through the end of October 2011, production totaled 1,713,038,000 barrels. If that pace continues, the year-end total should be around 2,055,646,000 barrels -- higher than any year since 2003. That&rsquo;s eight years ago, just as Obama said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe last time we looked at this question in March 2011, we noted that production levels actually have been quite&nbsp;stable over the period in question. The estimated level for 2011 is only about 13 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic. In addition, levels of production were typically higher from the 1950s to the 1990s.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, one caveat we mentioned in our last analysis -- that the Energy Information Administration projected that production totals were poised to fall over the subsequent two years -- no longer appears to be accurate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe most recent &quot;<a href=\"http://38.96.246.204/forecasts/steo/pdf/steo_full.pdf\">Short-Term Energy Outlook</a>,&quot; published on Jan. 12, 2012, forecast increases in total crude oil&nbsp;production in 2012 and 2013, thanks to increases in onshore production in the Lower 48, which overshadow declines in production in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe last issue is whether Obama and his administration claimed credit for this achievement and whether they&nbsp;deserve it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe government does play a role in shaping oil production, but many other factors, including private-sector business imperatives and the domestic and international energy market, are factors as well.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe think Obama&rsquo;s phrasing suggests that he thinks the administration&rsquo;s policies have played a role, saying, for instance, that &quot;over the last three years, we&rsquo;ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration.&quot; But we also&nbsp;think he does so cautiously.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tObama was correct when he said that &quot;right now, American oil production is the highest that it&rsquo;s been in eight years.&quot; We think he may have overstated his administration&rsquo;s role in achieving that, but not wildly so. We rate the claim Mostly True.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-24T23:28:39.403254", "ruling_date": "2012-01-24T23:49:18", "ruling_headline": "Barack Obama says U.S. oil production is at eight-year high", "ruling_headline_slug": "barack-obama-says-us-oil-production-eight-year-hig", "ruling_link_text": "An accurate statistic, though administration was only one factor of many", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBarack Obama, State of the Union address, Jan. 24,&nbsp;2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEnergy Information Administration, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS1&amp;f=A\">U.S</a><a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS1&amp;f=A\">.
