It was 8.4 percent in July 2011 and 8.5 percent a month later. That August rate was the highest Texas rate since November 1986, when <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/lauhsthl.htm\">Texas hit its worst unemployment rate</a>: 9.3 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTexas&rsquo; workforce also has increased steadily in recent decades; the state had 1.8 million more workers as of 2011 than it did in 2000. From another vantage point, some 434,000 workers were unemployed in 2000, 1.04 million in August 2011. That is, there was a 17.5 percent increase in the workforce in the decade-plus, but a 138.6 percent increase in the raw number of people without jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Texas unemployment didn&rsquo;t steadily increase in Perry&rsquo;s first 10 years as governor. Based on the bureau&rsquo;s figures, the state&rsquo;s jobless rate from late 2000 through August 2011 hit lows in 2000-01 and again in 2007, before rapidly climbing through 2009. (Click <a href=\"http://static.politifact.com.s3.amazonaws.com/politifact%2Fphotos%2FBLS_jobless_Texas_2000-2011.png\">here </a>to view a chart of Texas&rsquo; jobless rate using bureau numbers from 2000 to 2011.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere was a big increase in national unemployment rates after 2007, too, as the economy worsened. A fall 2010 <a href=\"http://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/2010/swe1003b.cfm\">Dallas Federal Reserve Bank analysis</a> said that Texas&rsquo; unemployment tracked the U.S. rate closely beginning in January 2007, though the state&rsquo;s rate was lower by an average of 1 percentage point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoes that mean Perry drove, or substantially influenced, the Texas changes?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked a similar statement last year. Examining a political action committee&#39;s claim that Perry &quot;had overseen the highest Texas unemployment in 22 years,&quot; we said the 22-year claim was accurate, but Perry wasn&rsquo;t personally to blame: <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/aug/28/back-basics/back-basics-pac-says-gov-rick-perry-has-overseen-t/\">Half True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGenerally, experts agreed, governors have little to do with statewide job losses or gains that take place during their terms. Paul Brace, a political science professor at Rice University, said: &quot;Overall unemployment wasn&#39;t (Perry&#39;s) fault, but our relatively good performance also has little to do with what he did.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat made sense then &mdash; and it does now.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTexas unemployment, lately at its highest level in more than two decades, doubled while Perry was governor, as Romney says. But it&rsquo;s wrong to conclude this was Perry&rsquo;s fault, as the Romney camp does in saying &quot;on his watch.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement as Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-09-22T15:38:20.230809", "ruling_date": "2011-09-23T17:57:41", "ruling_headline": "Mitt Romney campaign says Texas unemployment doubled under Rick Perry", "ruling_headline_slug": "mitt-romney-spokesperson-says-texas-unemployment-d", "ruling_link_text": "Ups and downs not in Perry's control", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/lauhsthl.htm\">chart </a>showing &quot;Current Unemployment Rates for States and Historical Highs/Lows&quot; and &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/lau/\">Local Area Unemployment Statistics for Texas</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/cps/#data\">Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey</a> (accessed September 22 and 23, 2011)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"../../../art/resource/1596/\">Chart</a> showing Texas unemployment rates 2000-2011, generated on Bureau of Labor Statistics website September 22, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>The New York Times</em>, news article,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/us/politics/opposing-views-of-perrys-jobs-record.html\">&quot;Opposing Views on Perry as Job-Creating Master,&quot;</a> Sept. 22, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDallas Federal Reserve Bank, analysis, <a href=\"http://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/2010/swe1003b.cfm\">&quot;Texas Twist: Why Did State&rsquo;s Unemployment Fall Below Nation&rsquo;s?,&quot;</a> third quarter 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Texas Truth-O-Meter item, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/aug/28/back-basics/back-basics-pac-says-gov-rick-perry-has-overseen-t/\">&quot;Back to Basics PAC says Gov.
