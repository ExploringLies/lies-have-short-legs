But it wasn&rsquo;t taken during Russia&rsquo;s 3-1 quarterfinal loss to Finland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photo was taken during an earlier game in the tournament between Russia and Slovakia. The Russians actually won the game where the photo was taken. The Russians beat Slovakia 1-0 in an overtime shootout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image making the rounds was captured by Sasha Mordovets, a contributor to Getty Images, on Feb. 16, 2014. (We confirmed this through Getty&#39;s image archives.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other photographers also captured the two Russian leaders at the Russia-Slovakia game. We found some from the Russian <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/16/us-olympics-putin-idUSBREA1F0PW20140216\"><u>news agency Ria Novosti</u></a>.

The photo is legit. But it was taken days earlier, during a Russian 1-0 victory against Slovakia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;re guessing Putin and Medvedev are sad that their team lost. But the photo circulating on the Internet does not actually depict that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-02-19T10:49:48.265804", "ruling_date": "2014-02-19T10:44:43", "ruling_headline": "Photo showing sad Putin and Medvedev was taken days earlier, during a Russian hockey victory", "ruling_headline_slug": "photo-showing-sad-putin-and-medvedev-was-taken-day", "ruling_link_text": "Taken days earlier", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Tweets, Feb. 19, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reuters, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/16/us-olympics-putin-idUSBREA1F0PW20140216\"><u>Russia&#39;s Putin basks in the glory of the Games</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian government website, &quot;<a href=\"http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/6683\"><u>Visit to Russia-Slovakia ice hockey match</u></a>,&quot; accessed Feb. 19, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getty images archives, accessed Feb. 19, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 2226, "last_name": "Tweets", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "tweets", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Twitter.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2226/", "total_count": 17, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.twitter.com/"}, "statement": "<p>A photo from the Russia-Finland hockey game shows a sad Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "posts on Twitter.", "statement_date": "2014-02-19", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 216, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/216/", "subject": "Sports", "subject_slug": "sports", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
