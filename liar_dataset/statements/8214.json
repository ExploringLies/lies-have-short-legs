Anthony List, an anti abortion-rights group, funded a new ad that claims Booker, a Democrat and Newark&rsquo;s mayor, condones abortion at any stage of pregnancy and without restrictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He supports late-term and partial-birth abortion and opposes safety regulations,&quot; the ad states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conservative activist Steve Lonegan is Booker&rsquo;s challenger in an Oct. 16 special election for a Senate seat left vacant after Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg&rsquo;s death in June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The groups say Booker&rsquo;s support of the Democratic National Committee&rsquo;s platform gives credence to their claim, but the Truth-O-Meter has determined there&rsquo;s a little more to this story than what the ad portrays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s begin by reviewing how the groups came to identify Booker&rsquo;s supposed support of late-term and partial-birth abortions, and opposition to safety regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mallory Quigley, communications director for the Susan B. Anthony group, directed us to Booker&rsquo;s support of the national committee&rsquo;s platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re taking a look at the Democratic Party platform which unequivocally supports a woman&rsquo;s right to choose without any restrictions and regardless of ability to pay,&quot; Quigley said. &quot;That was supported by Booker and a host of others.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the ad shows a clip from Booker&rsquo;s Sept. 4, 2012 address during a Planned Parenthood rally at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was a co-chair for the DNC platform, when we affirmed a woman&#39;s right to choose,&quot; Booker said during the rally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Quigley is correct that Booker and others supported the Democratic National Committee platform and women having the right to choose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s review the national committee&rsquo;s platform on abortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The platform makes no mention of specific procedures such as late-term or partial-birth abortion, and states support for a woman&rsquo;s right to make decisions about her pregnancy, &quot;including a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay,&quot; according to a statement from the Democratic National Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The committee also supports a woman&rsquo;s decision to carry a pregnancy to term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We strongly and unequivocally support a woman&#39;s decision to have a child by providing affordable health care and ensuring the availability of and access to programs that help women during pregnancy and after the birth of a child, including caring adoption programs,&quot; the platform states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we checked with Booker campaign spokesman Kevin Griffis about the mayor&rsquo;s stance on abortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We can all agree that we want to prevent unintended pregnancies, and therefore the need for abortion,&quot; Griffis said in an e-mail. &quot;Fundamentally, Mayor Booker believes that a woman&#39;s health decisions should remain between her and her doctor. Mayor Booker supports Roe v Wade, which allows women the right to choose up to the point of viability.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for late-term and partial-birth abortions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Cory Booker does not oppose restrictions on post-viability abortions if exceptions are made for the health and the life of the mother,&quot; Griffis said, meaning the mayor would support a woman&rsquo;s choice in that case to decide the fate of her pregnancy with her doctor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American Commitment Action Fund did not respond to our request for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new ad targeting Booker claims, &quot;He supports late-term and partial-birth abortion and opposes safety regulations.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for one of the groups behind the ad notes that Booker&rsquo;s stance on abortion comes from his support of the Democratic National Committee&rsquo;s 2012 platform, which Booker co-chaired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The platform, though, makes no mention of late-term or partial-birth abortion, which a Booker spokesman agreed the Democrat would support a woman&rsquo;s right to choose if&nbsp;her life or health is in danger.&nbsp;The platform says nothing else about safety regulations, which some states &ndash; such as Texas &ndash; have cited in attempts to ban abortion after a certain point in pregnancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That makes this claim partially accurate, but lacking important details -- and that fits the definition of Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To comment on this story, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/politifact_nj_cory_booker_supports_late-term_abortions_groups_claim_in_video_ad.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-08-30T17:16:09.360520", "ruling_date": "2013-09-01T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Cory Booker supports late-term abortion, opposes safety regulations groups claim", "ruling_headline_slug": "cory-booker-supports-late-term-abortion-opposes-sa", "ruling_link_text": "Reading between the lines?", "ruling_state": "New Jersey", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>NJ.com, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2013/08/republican_ad_hits_cory_booker_on_abortion.html\">Ad by conservative PAC attacks Cory Booker on abortion</a>, Aug. 23, 2013, accessed Aug. 27, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#BookerFAIL: <a href=\"http://bookerfail.com/\">Too Extreme (Cory Booker)</a>, Aug. 24, 2013, accessed Aug. 27 and 30, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WashingtonPost.com, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/08/23/conservative-groups-target-booker-on-abortion/\">Conservative groups target Booker on abortion</a>, Aug. 23, 2013, accessed Aug. 27, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LifeNews.com, <a href=\"http://www.lifenews.com/2013/08/23/blistering-ad-exposes-new-jersey-candidate-cory-bookers-pro-abortion-record/\">Blistering Ad Exposes New Jersey Candidate Cory Booker&rsquo;s Pro-Abortion Record</a>, Aug. 23, 2013, accessed Aug. 27, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mediaite.com, <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/?s=cokie+roberts+DNC+booker+abortion\">Cokie Roberts: DNC &lsquo;Really Over The Top&rsquo; On Abortion, Risks &lsquo;Alienating&rsquo; Pro-Life Dems</a>, Sept. 9, 2012, accessed Aug. 27, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philly.com, <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/nj/20130824_Lonegan-Booker_rhetoric_gathers_momentum.html\">Lonegan-Booker rhetoric gathers momentum</a>, Aug. 25, 2013, accessed Aug. 27, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Mallory Quigley, communications director, <a href=\"http://www.sba-list.org/\">Susan B.
