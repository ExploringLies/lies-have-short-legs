We were curious whether Moore&#39;s contrast holds up, especially per the infrequency of Cruz&#39;s forays to the valley, the region closest to the state&rsquo;s southeastern border with Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&#39;Anybody will tell you&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore, who was in McAllen when we talked to him, told us by phone that his claim -- meant to refer to Cruz&rsquo;s time as a senator, he said -- was based on what Moore had heard while in the valley. &quot;Everybody and anybody in the valley will tell you,&quot; Moore said, adding that Cruz had spoken at a club and then at a border park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After emailing Cruz&#39;s office about the accuracy of Moore&rsquo;s statement, we searched the Nexis database of news stories for accounts on Cruz trips to the valley and Iowa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the Texas mention, then count Cruz trips to Iowa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Several valley stops on Sept. 3, 2013</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Cruz&rsquo;s nearly 15 months as senator, he spent a weekday in the valley, according to regional news stories. That day was Sept. 3, 2013, when Cruz spoke at a sold-out luncheon in Mission and a stop at the Anzalduas International Bridge in Mission, according to news stories posted that day by the McAllen <em>Monitor</em> and <em>San Antonio Express-News</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email that Cruz did three events that day in the valley--going to McAllen for a Department of Public Safety border tour and roundtable with landowners to discuss border/immigration policy and to Mission for a &quot;Rio Grande Partnership&quot; lunch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz, Frazier said, looks forward to more events in the valley, &quot;one specific region in the state.&quot; &quot;Since being sworn in,&quot; she said, &quot;he has traveled to 38 Texas cities for 118 events.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz also stumped in the valley before his election. According to a <em>Monitor</em> <a href=\"http://www.themonitor.com/news/local/article_17d2330e-15a4-11e2-8aa1-001a4bcf6878.html\"><u>news story</u></a> posted online Oct. 13, 2012, Cruz was featured at a weekend event hosted at a Mission club by the McAllen Tea Party Association. Nearly 250 people paid $25 each to attend, according to the article. Cruz said then: &quot;We are campaigning all across the state of Texas. From the day we started this campaign nearly two years ago, we&rsquo;ve gone 18 hours a day, 7 days a week, crisscrossing the state.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore told us the fact that his tweet didn&rsquo;t say he was speaking to Cruz&rsquo;s time as senator wasn&rsquo;t significant, partly because Twitter posts are limited to 140 characters. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-moore/the-unhealthy-presidentia_b_5000849.html\"><u>A Moore commentary</u></a> published by the Huffington Post a few hours after he wrote his tweet was direct about focusing on Cruz&#39;s Senate time. Cruz, Moore wrote, &quot;has been to Iowa four times in the... months he has been in office but has made one appearance here in the subtropical region along the border.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Four Iowa trips</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now let&#39;s look north, where news stories indicate Cruz has been to the Hawkeye State four times since joining the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Feb. 11, 2014, a <em>Dallas Morning News</em> news blog post datelined Washington, D.C., opened by saying Cruz &quot;returns to Iowa next month -- his fourth trip in eight months, ensuring ongoing speculation about his 2016 ambitions.&quot; The newspaper made the same fourth-time-in-eight-months reference in its March 18, 2014, <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140318-ted-cruz-talks-religious-liberty-with-iowa-home-schoolers-demurs-on-2016-plans1.ece\"><u>news story</u></a> on Cruz&rsquo;s appearance before the Network of Iowa Christian Home Educators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And before?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz made his initial senatorial trip to Iowa in July 2013, according to a July 19, 2013, Associated Press <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/cruz-paul-address-religious-leaders-des-moines-200000488.html\"><u>news story</u></a>, giving a private speech to the conservative American Renewal Project and headlining a GOP fundraiser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/wayne-slater/20130719-ted-cruz-wows-iowa-pastors-republican-voters-in-first-visit.ece\"><u>commentary</u></a> by Wayne Slater of the <em>Morning News</em>, posted online that day, said that when reporters in Iowa inquired into Cruz&rsquo;s presidential ambitions, he demurred. &quot;I&#39;ve been in office all of seven months,&quot; Cruz said. &quot;Prior to that, the last elective office I held was student council. It&#39;s been quite a whirlwind.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The senator&rsquo;s second Iowa stop occurred Aug. 10, 2013 when he spoke to hundreds of evangelical Christians and social conservatives at a summit in Ames, Iowa, according to a <a href=\"http://amestrib.com/sections/news/ames-and-story-county/summit-pushes-action-social-conservatives.html\"><u>news story</u></a> posted online that day by the <em>Ames Tribune</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another Iowa stop, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/ted-cruz-delivers-stemwinder-iowa-ronald-reagan-dinner-98883.html\"><u>Politico reported</u></a>, entailed Cruz stirring Iowa Republicans at an annual fundraising dinner Oct. 25, 2013 before heading to a pheasant hunt in the state. In an Oct. 26, 2013, news story, the <em>Omaha World-Herald</em> summed up: &quot;This was Cruz&#39;s third visit to Iowa this year...&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The &#39;fair comparison&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Cruz&#39;s behalf, Frazier said by email the &quot;fair comparison to make is that the senator has been to Iowa 4 times and travels back to Texas almost every weekend.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore tweeted: &quot;Ted Cruz has been to Iowa four times. Rio Grande Valley of Texas -- just once.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is correct if limited to Cruz&rsquo;s year-plus as the state&rsquo;s junior senator, which is what Moore made clear in his subsequent blog post.
