Chris Christie on Tuesday announced -- once again -- that he would not run for president, his conservative credentials and record in New Jersey had come under attack by members of each party.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublican presidential candidate Herman Cain said Christie was too liberal, and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/article/2011/oct/03/putting-chris-christie-test-job-creation/\">Democratic Maryland Gov. Martin O&rsquo;Malley blamed Christie for high unemployment in the Garden State</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen the governor announced his decision to stay put in New Jersey, a reporter asked how much the criticism played into his decision.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;None. None. Because New Jersey&#39;s unemployment is significantly lower than it was when I got here,&quot; Christie said in a nationally televised news conference on Tuesday. &quot;And we&#39;ve created 50,000 new private-sector jobs in the last 20 months after having lost 117,000 in the year before I got here.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor is sticking around New Jersey -- &quot;whether you like it or not,&quot; as he said -- so PolitiFact New Jersey decided to see if the man in charge of Trenton has his facts straight.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found that his numbers are accurate, but as in previous cases, he may be taking too much credit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s review the unemployment changes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Christie took office in January 2010, New Jersey&rsquo;s unemployment rate stood at 9.8 percent and there were 441,223 unemployed individuals, according to federal labor statistics. As of August 2011, the most recent data available, the state&rsquo;s unemployment rate was 9.4 percent with 421,676 unemployed people.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means the unemployment rate dropped by 0.4 percent and the number of unemployed individuals fell by 19,547. However, Christie said unemployment was &quot;significantly lower.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey&rsquo;s unemployment rate is moving in the right direction, but to be considered statistically significant, an over-the-year change in the state&rsquo;s unemployment rate would have to be 0.9 percent, according to Sandra Mason, chief of the division of Local Area Unemployment Statistics at the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey&rsquo;s unemployment rate is lower, but not statistically significant.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s talk about that private-sector job growth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom February 2010 to August 2011, the state added 45,300 private-sector jobs. So the governor&rsquo;s numbers are largely accurate -- but Christie can&rsquo;t take all the credit for private-sector job growth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/21/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-says-he-introduced-his-first-bu/\">previous ruling</a> on a Christie statement about private-sector job creation, we spoke to several experts who said growth in that sector is the result of a variety of factors and can&rsquo;t be attributed specifically to any governor. We rated the statement Half True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKim Rueben, director of the state and local program of the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said in an Aug. 17 email that &quot;it isn&rsquo;t clear a specific governor can take a lot of credit for the new jobs. I think governors and state governments can change the climate but in general there has been little research showing specific programs (or economic development credits) have actually led to job creation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie also said the job growth in his administration came after New Jersey lost 117,000 private-sector jobs the year before he took office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you look at labor statistics from December 2008 to December 2009, Christie is dead on: the state lost 117,700 private-sector jobs. From January 2009 to January 2010, 105,000 private-sector jobs were eliminated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRutgers University professor Joseph Seneca told us the three measures cited above -- the reduction in the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed persons, and the increase in private-sector jobs -- all tell the same story.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The data from both surveys point to improving labor market conditions,&quot; Seneca said. &quot;It&rsquo;s a good start.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie said, &quot;New Jersey&#39;s unemployment is significantly lower than it was when I got here. And we&#39;ve created 50,000 new private-sector jobs in the last 20 months after having lost 117,000 in the year before I got here.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis statistics on private-sector job growth are accurate, and the unemployment rate is lower. But the unemployment decline is not statistically significant. And as we&rsquo;ve said in the past, Christie can&rsquo;t take all the credit for job growth in the Garden State.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his statement Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this story, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/10/politifact_nj_how_much_credit.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-04T17:56:42.264246", "ruling_date": "2011-10-04T18:25:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie talks up job growth in New Jersey", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-talks-job-growth-new-jersey", "ruling_link_text": "Numbers hit the mark", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tLiveStream, <a href=\"http://livestre.am/141ZN%20\">Gov.
