The report was about the foundation&rsquo;s annual survey of private and non-federal public employers on the costs of employer-sponsored health benefits. The survey was done from January through May of 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser found that the average annual premium for family coverage was $16,834 in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Kaiser&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/7790.pdf\">2008 survey</a>, the average was $12,680. So, the average increased by $4,154 -- the amount Walker claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the earlier survey was done from January through May of 2008, when Republican George W. Bush was still president. Obama didn&rsquo;t take office until January 2009. That makes it a bad starting point to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, the average annual premium for family coverage was $13,375, according to Kaiser&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/7936.pdf\">2009 survey</a>, which also was done in the January-May timeframe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means the increase since Obama took office, from 2009 to 2014, was $3,459, not the $4,154 that Walker claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for context for the figures, Kaiser found that from 2009 to 2014, the average family premium rose by 26 percent -- which it called &quot;significantly lower&quot; than the 34 percent growth in the previous five-year period, from 2004 to 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A final note: Two months before Walker made his claim, U.S. Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., made the same claim, also in a tweet and citing the same Kaiser report. PolitiFact Virginia rated her claim, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/feb/02/barbara-comstock/comstock-says-family-health-policies-have-increase/\">Mostly False</a>. That fits here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said that under Obama, &quot;the average cost of family health care premiums has increased by $4,154.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The figure is correct when comparing 2008 to 2014 and using figures from a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected source on health care. But that includes a period before Obama took office in January 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The increase is less -- $3,459 -- when comparing 2009 to 2014. Moreover, despite the implication in Walker&rsquo;s statement, the increase in average family premiums from 2009 to 2014 is less&nbsp;than it was the previous five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Walker&rsquo;s statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-testing-scott-walker-claim-on-health-care-costs-under-barack-obama-b99476194z1-298914391.html\">web page</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-04-06T17:14:31.456126", "ruling_date": "2015-04-07T11:05:20", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker sees big rise in health insurance premiums under Barack Obama", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-sees-big-rise-health-insurance-premiu", "ruling_link_text": "Less than Walker claims -- and less than increases before Obama took office", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Twitter, Gov.
