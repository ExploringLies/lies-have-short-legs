We had to check this one out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<font size=\"3\"><font face=\"verdana\"><font face=\"verdana\"><font size=\"3\">The race for state House </font></font>District 81 is one of the most heated and closely contested</font></font> legislative contests in Georgia this year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublican Jill Chambers, a feisty iconoclast, is trying to keep her seat against Parent, a former litigator who worked for a Democratic state senator who became the ambassador to Singapore.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChambers has served in the House since 2003 and is best known for her work on MARTA&#39;s oversight committee, known as MARTOC.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<font size=\"3\"><font face=\"verdana\">Neither party dominates the district, which runs along Buford Highway in DeKalb County northeast of Atlanta. Democrats think the seat is up for grabs. The outspoken Chambers thinks she is on her way to re-election. </font></font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe campaign is ugly. Parent lobbed attacks accusing Chambers of wastefully spending taxpayer money. Parent&#39;s campaign has also launched websites dedicated to attacking the incumbent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast week, Chambers blitzed voters<font size=\"3\"><font face=\"verdana\"> with three automated telephone messages, or robocalls, and a mailer accusing Parent of taking money intended for schoolchildren:</font></font><br style=\"font-family: Verdana;\" />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This is an important voter alert for PTA members in DeKalb County,&quot; a voice on one of the robocalls said. &quot;Candidate Elena Parent has taken over $22,000 intended for our schoolchildren in campaign contributions from a law firm representing the corrupt DeKalb school board.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;DeKalb County can no longer afford to have politicians like Crawford Lewis, the indicted former school superintendent, and Elena Parent jeopardize our school system&rsquo;s future. Since these contributions became public last week, Elena Parent has repeatedly refused to return the money. Please call Elena Parent today and tell her to return these contributions.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<font face=\"verdana\" size=\"3\">The mailer asks, &quot;Hey, Elena Parent, what did you promise in return for $22,585.09 in contributions from the law firm for the corrupt DeKalb County Board?&quot; </font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt is true that corruption accusations are rocking DeKalb schools. In May, Lewis, former chief operating officer Patricia Reid, Reid&#39;s former husband and Reid&#39;s secretary were indicted on accusations that Reid ran a criminal enterprise that steered millions of dollars in contracts to the ex-husband, an architect.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe attack&#39;s logic is that the school system&#39;s legal fees skyrocketed from its budget of roughly $900,000 to $5 million, Chambers said. That means money that should be going to student education is filling the coffers of Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan, the law firm to which the attack ads refer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSutherland&#39;s employees are therefore giving political donations with money intended for children, the line of reasoning goes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs this accurate?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<font size=\"3\">We looked at Parent&#39;s campaign contribution disclosure reports, which she filed with the State Ethics Commission of Georgia.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe campaign donation figures are correct. From</font> mid-2009 th<font size=\"3\">rough July, Parent received exactly $22,585.09 in cash and in-kind donations from people who listed their employer as Sutherland, where Parent used to work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<font size=\"3\">Chambers&#39; attack mailer has other correct information. </font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<font size=\"3\">Sutherland does have a contract to provide legal services for DeKalb County schools, including in the Reid matter. The school system does not have its own in-house legal department</font></font>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<font size=\"3\"><font size=\"3\">Records show DeKalb arranged to pay Sutherland $120,555 a month for its services, as Chambers&#39; mailer said. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution </font></font><font size=\"3\"><font color=\"#000000\">reported that DeKalb schools spent $5.79 million on lawyers from July 1, 2009, to June 30, 2010, when the district had budgeted $934,816 for legal expenses.</font></font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<font size=\"3\"><font size=\"3\">But those contributions to Parent&#39;s campaign don&#39;t come directly from Sutherland, as the robocall suggests. Its employees made individual donations with their own money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChambers acknowledges this, and two of her other ads say the donations are from lawyers, not the firm.&nbsp; </font></font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<font size=\"3\">There are other problems with Chambers&#39; claims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<font size=\"3\">None of the school system&#39;s board members was named in the indictment. A schools spokesman said it is therefore inaccurate to call the board &quot;corrupt.&quot;</font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd saying campaign contributions to Parent came from money intended for schoolchildren tests the bounds of logic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing Chambers&#39; reasoning, if a Sutherland lawyer bought a candy bar at a Wal-Mart, you could accuse the retailer of taking money intended for schoolchildren.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo while Chambers&#39; attack mailer contains some correct information, the robocall accusation against Parent is incorrect and borders on the ridiculous.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&#39;s unfair to call the DeKalb school board corrupt. School employees, not board members, were indicted. And no one has been convicted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe contributions were not directly from Sutherland, as the call implied, and were not intended for children. They were from individual contributors who used their personal funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis House race is smoking. We give Chambers a Pants On Fire for this one.&nbsp; </font></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-07T12:02:45.698122", "ruling_date": "2010-10-08T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Candidate for state House said her rival took money intended for schoolchildren", "ruling_headline_slug": "candidate-state-house-said-her-rival-took-money-in", "ruling_link_text": "What's next?
