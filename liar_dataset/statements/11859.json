But it wasn&rsquo;t just on that one occasion that Clinton was more than just hopeful about the deal&rsquo;s impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She declared in <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2012/11/200664.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>November 2012 remarks in Singapore</u></a> that it would &quot;lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It will cover 40 percent of the world&#39;s total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment.
