How about a pizza?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sounds good. We&#39;re hungry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the ad quickly turns to one of Burke&#39;s key campaign themes -- that Gov. Scott Walker favors big business and the well-to-do over average folk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Walker&#39;s &quot;tax plan,&quot; the narrator continues, &quot;the average Wisconsin taxpayer got just $11 a month. But corporations got $610 million in tax cuts. Millionaires got at least $1,400 per year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad ends with &quot;Scott Walker -- Millions for them, pizza for you.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doesn&#39;t sound quite as tasty any more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burke&rsquo;s reference to a &quot;tax plan&quot; suggests Walker has had only one, when there have been several measures affecting income and property taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, notably, she expresses each dollar amount differently -- a small per-month figure for the average taxpayer, versus a large lump sum for corporations and a large per-year figure for millionaires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let&rsquo;s slice up Burke&#39;s claim into its three pieces and see what we have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Average taxpayer: $11 per month</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the narrator speaks about the average taxpayer and Walker&rsquo;s tax plan, a footnote appears on the screen referencing the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state&rsquo;s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, and a date: July 28, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the footnote doesn&rsquo;t give the viewer a clear idea of what Burke is citing -- or that it just provides a partial picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/sendem/LegislativeMemos/LFB%20memo%20to%20Sen%20%20Shilling%20re%20Distributional%20Information%20on%20Individual%20Income%20Tax%20Rate%20Reduction%20%287%2028%2014%29.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>A memo</u></a> issued by the bureau on that day details two state income cuts signed into law by Walker in 2013. It says a taxpayer with an adjusted gross income of $40,000 to $50,000 will save an average of $133 in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That comes to about $11 per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&rsquo;s campaign, meanwhile, noted that the same memo pegs the average savings -- rather than the savings for the average taxpayer -- slightly higher, at $189 per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That would be about $16 per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The larger point, however, is that besides income tax cuts, Walker has approved a number of property tax relief measures. These are ignored by Burke, who made a broad claim but then supported it only by citing reductions in one type of tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Walker claimed that his various income and property tax cuts amount to $322 in the 2014 tax year for the average family, our rating was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/26/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-tax-cuts-amount-322-average-fami/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mostly True</u></a>. That comes to about $27 per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that the income and property tax cuts would save the median-income family at least that much in 2014, although not every average family would save that much, particularly if they are not property owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Corporations: $610 million</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burke overstates the second part of her claim -- that corporations got $610 million in tax cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That figure is based on another <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/sendem/LegislativeMemos/LFB-memo-Tax-Law-Changes-Since-January-2011.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>fiscal bureau memo</u></a>, which calculates tax savings over Walker&rsquo;s full four-year term. The memo describes those tax reductions as being &quot;targeted to businesses,&quot; not necessarily corporations, which suggests large operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, some of the tax cuts apply to small businesses as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, $126 million of the $610 million comes from <a href=\"http://www.revenue.wi.gov/taxpro/fact/manufandagr.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>reducing the state tax</u></a> on the production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses. Businesses organized like limited liability companies -- whose shareholders pay the firm&#39;s tax as personal income tax -- benefit from the reduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Millionaires: $1,400 per year</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third part of Burke&rsquo;s claim goes back to the 2013 income tax cuts. The fiscal bureau estimated that people with an adjusted gross income of $300,000 or more would see a tax decrease averaging $1,402 in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the $133 decrease for what Burke described as the average taxpayer was a reduction of 8 percent, while the the reduction for millionaires is 2.32 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, again, she uses an annual figure for the millionaires, but a monthly one for the average folks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burke said that under Walker&#39;s &quot;tax plan, the average Wisconsin taxpayer got just $11 a month. But corporations got $610 million in tax cuts. Millionaires got at least $1,400 per year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $11 refers only to income tax cuts, when in fact the typical taxpayer has also enjoyed property tax reductions. The $610 million applies to small businesses as well as corporations. And it&rsquo;s correct that millionaires got at least $1,400 per year in tax reductions.&nbsp;In short, the claim uses different figures that when mashed together are misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is partially accurate,<strong> </strong>but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-checking-mary-burke-claim-on-scott-walker-tax-cuts-b99371887z1-279329862.html\">web page</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-15T14:02:28.902425", "ruling_date": "2014-10-16T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker's \"tax plan\" favors corporations, rich over average taxpayer, Mary Burke says", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walkers-tax-plan-favors-rich-corporations-ov", "ruling_link_text": "The numbers are a jumble", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, Mary Burke campaign &quot;Pizza&quot; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu4yQTzxwqM\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>TV ad</u></a>, Oct. 8, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Mary Burke campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Wilson, Oct. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Gov.
