I get bigger crowds than they do. It&#39;s true. I get far bigger crowds.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the sake of argument, let&rsquo;s take Trump at his word on the size of his crowds. (We do this full-well knowing Trump is <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/15/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-donald-trump-exaggerated-his-cr/\">guilty of exaggerating the size of his crowds</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We go to Oklahoma, we have 25,000 people,&quot; Trump said in August. &quot;We had 21,000 people in Dallas, we had 35,000 people in Mobile, Alabama. We get these massive crowds. Look, if (Clinton) had 500 people I would be surprised.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a photo from that Mobile rally:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ENHM-pvMZGYSEhq4IIeGu_qf1T0lJcUj1ePWcOIonOdSnXycozLbGYeARMeozrIvcmy1Xmy74-75XD6-Gp-SXvXuo_bXeC91OqDkNfHvToCEXsS7Q98ex02wfAgwb8H1BkHkdLOW\" style=\"border:none; height:351px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, if you take Trump as his word, that&rsquo;s an average of 27,000 for those three big rallies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a good draw. But it&rsquo;s not Jay Z/Beyonce level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jay Z last toured in 2014 with Beyonce to promote her self-titled album and his <em>Magna Carta&nbsp;Holy Grail</em>. The couple played 16 shows across North America, and <a href=\"https://www.pollstarpro.com/files/charts2014/2014YearEndTop100InternationalBoxOffice.pdf\">one</a> in Paris, raking in<a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6207007/jay-z-beyonce-on-the-run-tour-100-million\"> over $100 million</a> in ticket sales. All were sold out and averaged a crowd size of 45,700 per night, according to <a href=\"http://www.webcitation.org/6SJsHCRwA\">data</a> assembled by Billboard. The biggest one-night performance drew a crowd of nearly 53,000 while their two-night Paris show topped 147,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a photo from their Seattle show, via Wikimedia Commons</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_MV_KHYQVQAcoaOQfT9ejbb-wnkYQYyiM0WNEdFOyf5bWlujSA4EEu0SelvcjNT4G7rR2eDkBv4JtcBbwFL0VfJHyDT81vzdjcjAf28Gc4w-hlg1NKajnX8s-ox4XL2r6bEVVYGd\" style=\"border:none; height:240px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyonce, who wrapped up her <a href=\"http://www.rap-up.com/2016/08/12/beyonce-formation-tour-210-million-ticket-sales/\">$210 million</a> <em>Formation </em>tour in October, performed 49 sold-out shows across North America and Europe. She drew an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16iX9ZakBrZg4N98QefHzd9St0eLq8gnM5Um_d2CKdfY/edit?usp=sharing\">average crowd of 45,423 per night</a> and a record one-night crowd of <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7469424/beyonce-formation-world-tour-ticket-sales\">75,106</a> in Paris this July.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyonce and Jay Z campaigned with Clinton Friday in Cleveland at an event that drew about 10,000 people,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/11/04/beyonce-cleveland-clinton-event-history/93291870/\">according to estimates</a>. That&#39;s comparable to the size of many Trump crowds but certainly smaller than some of Trump&#39;s bigger crowds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To fully vet this bizarre claim, it&rsquo;s worth noting that Trump&rsquo;s rallies are free.
