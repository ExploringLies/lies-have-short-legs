The very same report, however, notes that  unemployment will average 10 percent for the rest of the year. The Obama administration promised the trillion-dollar 'stimulus' would create jobs  'immediately' and keep joblessness below 8 percent.\"<br /><br />The report does, in  fact, project that the unemployment rate will hover at about 10 percent through  this year. With many press accounts of the economic report highlighting the  forecast that job gains for 2010 will average 95,000 a month, those two facts  may seem at odds. They are not.<br /><br />\"A certain number of jobs need to be created every  month simply to hold the unemployment rate stable,\" said Gary Burtless, senior  fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. \"That's because the  working-age population is growing.\"<br /><br />In addition, as the job market improves -- or is even  perceived as improving -- some people who had given up on looking for work may  get back in the game and be added to the unemployed ranks. So there would have  to be about 100,000 jobs added a month just for the unemployment rate to tread  water.<br /><br />Even still,  the report says, there's evidence the labor market is stabilizing.<br /><br />That's because the  economy shed 691,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2009, 428,000 in the second  quarter, 199,000 in the third, and 69,000 in the fourth. So to have the number  of jobs increasing even moderately is an improvement.<br /><br />But Boehner's  statement includes an assumption masquerading as a fact: It's that the stimulus  has failed if unemployment rates remain at 10 percent through the  year.</p>\r\n<p>While Boehner and other Republicans have long cited rising unemployment as  proof that the stimulus hasn't created jobs, many reputable and independent  economists say it has, and that the unemployment rate would be even worse  without it. The \"Economic Report of the President\" estimates the stimulus has already saved or  created 1.5 million to 2 million jobs, and is on track to save 3.5 million by the end of this  year. We gave President Obama a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/27/barack-obama/obama-claims-two-million-more-americans-would-be-u/\" target=\"_blank\">Half True</a> when he claimed in his State of the  Union address that the stimulus has already saved or created 2 million jobs,  because that was on the high side of projections from his Council of Economic  Advisers, the independent Congressional Budget Office and several other  reputable economic forecasters. But we should note all of those forecasters put  the number north of 1 million jobs.<br /><br />In other words, just because the unemployment rate  may stay at a whopping 10 percent, \"doesn't mean that the stimulus didn't  prevent an even worse catastrophe,\" Burtless said.<br /><br />As for the last bit of  Boehner's statement, we gave a<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/09/eric-cantor/Cantor-and-other-republicans-say-obama-promised-s/\" target=\"_blank\"> Barely True</a> to House Republican Whip Eric Cantor  and other Republicans who have continued to claim that Obama promised the  stimulus would keep unemployment rates below 8 percent. That was a forecast  based on where the unemployment rate was expected to go without a stimulus. That  forecast was in line with other independent forecasts at the time, but proved  overly optimistic, as Christina Romer, chair of the White House Council of  Economic Advisers, acknowledged again in a press conference on Feb. 11, 2010.<br /><br />So Boehner is correct  that the president's economic report forecasts the unemployment rate will remain  at 10 percent through this year (even as jobs are added). But again, when  Boehner cites that statistic as proof that the stimulus is having no immediate  effect on jobless rates as promised, it ignores the possibility that if not  for the stimulus the unemployment rate might be even worse. Many economic  forecasters believe that's exactly the case. Still, projections about the number  of jobs saved or created by the stimulus are just that, projections. And many  economists believe it is still way too early to measure its effectiveness. But  we think it's misleading to simply point to a stagnant unemployment rate as  proof that the stimulus isn't working. And so we rate Boehner's statement Mostly  True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-02-11T19:06:50.281527", "ruling_date": "2010-02-11T19:36:49", "ruling_headline": "Boehner says unemployment will stay at 10 percent this year", "ruling_headline_slug": "boehner-says-stimulus-no-triumph-if-unemployment-s", "ruling_link_text": "Unemployment rate may stay the same, even as jobs are added", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>White House Web site, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/economic-report-president.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Economic Report of the President</a>, Feb. 11, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Rep.
