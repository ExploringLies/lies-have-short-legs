Rick Perry for two election  seasons, says she saw a sign of GOP bigwigs running scared the night  Perry bested U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and upstart Debra Medina for  their party&rsquo;s 2010 gubernatorial nomination.<br /><br />Curtis  helms Independent Texans, a group that has a Web site where visitors can  &ldquo;blow up&rdquo; Perry&rsquo;s head.<br /><br />In a March 3 Web post  headlined &ldquo;Where Do Indies Go Now That Rick Perry&rsquo;s Party is Over,&rdquo;  Curtis writes: &ldquo;Kay&rsquo;s concession speech came with less than 20 percent  of the precincts having been counted.&rdquo; Curtis saw meaning in the timing  of Hutchison&rsquo;s speech, which was televised statewide from her campaign  party in Dallas.<br /><br />&ldquo;It was clear that regular Republicans,  out of weakness in the face of the Medina insurgency, needed to circle  the wagons,&rdquo; Curtis writes. &ldquo;It was a very fractious (primary campaign)  fight. They were risking bedlam breaking out if they didn&rsquo;t patch things  up quickly.&rdquo;<br /><br />We wondered if Curtis accurately  characterized the timing of the concession and if Hutchison and Perry  were in cahoots to kiss and make up.<br /><br />Perry's challengers  combined for 49 percent of nearly 1.5 million votes cast. Hutchison got  30.3 percent and Medina won 18.6 percent, according to the Texas  Secretary of State&rsquo;s office. Perry drew 51 percent.<br /><br />Curtis  told us she suspects the Hutchison and Perry camps had been in touch  before the results were known and knew they needed to showcase unity as  soon as possible. &ldquo;This is what I would do if I was just trying to  maintain the status quo,&rdquo; Curtis said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a conspiracy; it&rsquo;s what  they do, kind of a natural move.&rdquo;<br /><br />First, did  Curtis get her numbers right?<br /><br />She was close.  Hutchison conceded about 9:30 p.m.  March 2. At 9:18 p.m., the AP had posted results from the primary based  on 1,868 of 8,236 precincts, or nearly 23 percent, reporting.<br /><br />It's  not unheard of for candidates to give in before most votes are counted.  In November 2006, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Chris Bell conceded  before the night was through. However, Bell spoke after the AP had  declared Perry the winner, shortly before 9 p.m. <br /><br />This  year, the Associated Press declared Perry the victor of the GOP gubernatorial primary  at 10:56 p.m., about 90 minutes after Hutchison conceded.<br /><br />Second,  was Hutchison's timing part of a joint Hutchison-Perry \"unity\"  strategy?<br /><br />Mark Miner, spokesman for Perry's campaign,  said there was no coordination between the campaigns on primary night.  \"That's just ridiculous,\" Miner said of Curtis's Web post. \"I'm sure she  wrote it from a black helicopter.\" <br /><br />Hutchison's  campaign chairman, Jim Francis of Dallas, likewise disputed Curtis&rsquo;s  take on collaboration between the camps.<br /><br />&ldquo;To drag it  out past 10 o&rsquo;clock at night was sort of an unfair thing to do to  Perry,\" Francis said. \"It was clear what the situation was. Kay wanted  to exit in a classy, dignified way. That&rsquo;s what she decided. There  wasn&rsquo;t any strategy about it.&rdquo;<br /><br />Besides, even if she'd  squeaked into a runoff, Francis said, Hutchison had already decided to  concede if she trailed Perry by 20 percentage points or so -- and she  did. <br /><br />So how does Curtis rate on the Truth-O-Meter?<br /><br />Hutchison  conceded after about 23 percent of precincts had reported -- not less  than 20 percent as Curtis said, but close.<br /><br />Neither  the Hutchison nor Perry campaign confirmed Curtis's hunch that they  strategized to hurry the senator's concession--and there's no  independent way to prove or disprove her speculation. Regardless, it  isn't part of her statement.<br /><br />We rate Curtis's statement as Mostly True. <br /><br /></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-12T17:59:59.921527", "ruling_date": "2010-03-15T06:14:16", "ruling_headline": "Independent activist Linda Curtis says Sen.
