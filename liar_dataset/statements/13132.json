This makes Clinton&rsquo;s statement correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, we think using the definition of &quot;young&quot; as 15-24 is a reasonable one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as you define &quot;young&quot; as being between the ages of 15 and 24, Clinton&rsquo;s statement is accurate, according to CDC data.
