The issue faded after Obama released a long-form version of his birth certificate showing he was born in Hawaii, but it wasn&rsquo;t until a couple of weeks ago that Trump publicly put the matter to rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When debate moderator Lester Holt asked Trump what took him so long, Trump tried to divert blame for the birther movement to two Clinton insiders, Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton&rsquo;s 2008 campaign manager, and Sidney Blumenthal, a friend and occasional staffer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Blumenthal sent McClatchy -- a highly respected reporter at McClatchy -- to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Were Solis Doyle and Blumenthal -- two top Clinton aides in 2008 -- pressing the birther movement very hard?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll take each person in turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Doyle said on CNN</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/16/politics/hillary-clinton-patti-solis-doyle-birther-donald-trump/\">Doyle was on CNN</a> on Sept. 16, 2016, and she was talking about an episode in 2007 during the Democratic primary. Doyle described a volunteer coordinator in Iowa who forwarded an email that promoted &quot;the conspiracy.&quot; Asked during the interview if she meant the birther rumor, Doyle said she did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump campaign pointed to this as an admission that at least someone in the campaign played a role. But Doyle later clarified she was referring to a volunteer who was fired for forwarding an email about Obama&rsquo;s religion, not birthplace. Regardless of what Doyle said in her interview, that is what happened. (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/sep/25/obama-muslim-myth-clinton-connection/\">PolitiFact wrote about it here</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A rumor about Obama&rsquo;s religion has an important difference from a rumor about his birthplace. While the two falsehoods overlap, only one -- whether he was born in the United States, would affect his ability to hold office under the Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Blumenthal and McClatchy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blumenthal became a central figure in the birther controversy just recently. James Asher, the former Washington bureau chief of the McClatchy News service, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimasher/status/776612456135262212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweeted</a> on Sept. 15, 2016, that Blumenthal suggested in 2008 he look into rumors that Obama was born in Kenya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Blumenthal has told many news organizations that the editor&rsquo;s claim is false, and that he never raised the issue of Obama&rsquo;s birthplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article102828747.html\">McClatchy reporter tried to reconstruct</a> what actually happened, he confirmed that Blumenthal contacted Asher, and that a McClatchy reporter in Kenya explored whether Obama was born there, along with running down several other rumors. But McClatchy found no proof that Blumenthal questioned Obama&rsquo;s birthplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article quoted an email Blumenthal sent to Asher in 2008. While Blumenthal discusses Obama&rsquo;s family connections to Kenya, there&rsquo;s no mention of where Obama was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;On Kenya, your person in the field might look into the impact there of Obama&rsquo;s public comments about his father. I&rsquo;m told by State Dept officials that Obama publicly derided his father on his visit there and that was regarded as embarrassing,&quot; Blumenthal wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asher gave a new statement to McClatchy that steps back a bit from the certainty he expressed in his original tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Blumenthal visited the Washington Bureau of McClatchy, where he and I met in my office,&quot; Asher said. &quot;During that conversation and in subsequent communications, we discussed a number of matters related to Obama. He encouraged McClatchy to do stories related to Obama and his connections to Kenya.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asher said he remembered Blumenthal mentioning Obama&rsquo;s birthplace but acknowledged that he had nothing in writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that Clinton insiders pushed the rumor that Obama was not born in America. His first example, Doyle, actually was involved in firing a county level volunteer coordinator who spread the rumor that Obama was a Muslim. The president&rsquo;s religion might overlap thematically, but it is distinct from rumors about his birthplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s focus on Blumenthal lacks solid evidence. Blumenthal denies the allegation and the man who made it says he has no written proof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/92a47423-d419-497c-800a-ea34cf90ecf1\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/92a47423-d419-497c-800a-ea34cf90ecf1</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-27T01:26:26.717209", "ruling_date": "2016-09-27T01:30:48", "ruling_headline": "Trump falsely tries to pin birtherism on Clinton insiders", "ruling_headline_slug": "trump-again-tries-pin-birtherism-clinton-insiders", "ruling_link_text": "Despite repetition, still not true", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/sep/25/obama-muslim-myth-clinton-connection/\">The Obama Muslim Myth: The Clinton connection</a>, Sept. 25, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/sep/20/hillary-clinton-and-birther-movement-still-no-ther/\">Hillary Clinton and the birther movement: Still nothing there</a>, Sept. 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2007/12/clinton-staffer-on-anti-obama-email-chain-updated-004503\">Clinton staffer on anti-Obama email chain</a>, Dec. 5, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press,<a href=\"http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2007/dec/06/clinton-volunteer-coordinator-resigns-over-e-mail-/?f=news-politics-elections\">Clinton volunteer coordinator resigns over e-mail claiming Obama is Muslim</a>, Dec. 6, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Stranger,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://slog.thestranger.com/2007/12/clinton_backer_pushing_false_obamaismusl\">Clinton Backer Pushed False Obama-is-Muslim Story</a>, Dec. 5, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Des Moines Register</em>, Clinton chairwoman dismissed over e-mail, Dec. 6, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, Clinton Campaign Seeks Resignation Of 2nd Volunteer In Obama Flap, Dec. 10, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McClatchy DC,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article102828747.html\">It&rsquo;s one person&rsquo;s word against another on the birther rumor</a>, Sept. 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UPI, Trump doubts Obama born in Hawaii, March 17, 2011, via Nexis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABC, The View, March 24, 2011, via Nexis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Factcheck.org,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2011/04/donald-youre-fired/\">Donald, You&rsquo;re Fired!</a>, April 9, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1104/25/acd.02.html\">Birthplace Facts, Not Birther Fiction;
