We&rsquo;re No. 3!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s what we heard from Libertarians in the purple state of Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spotted a claim about the numbers and growth of libertarians in an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXz-c9wvFVI&amp;feature=c4-overview-vl&amp;list=PLMxQ3aCP02iQq-1qFUtGPNbusMIMbJgQc\">announcement</a> about a Libertarian event in Broward County:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Libertarian Party is the third-largest organized political party in the United States and has seen tremendous growth over the last two years as many Democrats and Republicans have become disenchanted with their respective parties.&quot; (The article was written by Karl Dickey who serves on the Libertarian Party of Florida&rsquo;s executive committee and represents Broward, Palm Beach and Hendry counties.) We found a similar claim on the <a href=\"http://www.lpbroward.org/home.htm\">Libertarian Party of Broward</a> website that the party is &quot;the third-largest political party in the U.S.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to explore the numbers and the power of the Libertarian Party. Is it the third-largest party in the country?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve looked at the numbers of Libertarians in the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/jun/19/libertarian-party-texas/libertarian-party-says-major-parties-have-shed-reg/\">past</a>. But as Sen. Rand Paul -- a Kentucky Republican with a libertarian outlook -- <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/06/10/rand-paul-and-the-rise-of-the-libertarian-republican/\">makes</a> <a href=\"http://time100.time.com/2013/04/18/cover-shots/slide/rand-paul/\">headlines</a> as a potential 2016 presidential contender, it seemed like a good time to revisit the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Counting libertarians</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libertarian activists and political scientists we contacted suggested the same source: Richard Winger, a Libertarian in California and editor of a monthly newsletter, <a href=\"http://www.ballot-access.org/\">Ballot Access News</a>, which includes data on party registration that Winger researches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His December issue showed there were 325,807 registered Libertarians nationwide. (About half the states tally Libertarians, Winger&rsquo;s data shows.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of registered Libertarians was higher than other national third parties including the Green, Constitution or Reform parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But with Democrats&rsquo; registration at 43.5 million and Republicans at 41.3 million according to Winger&rsquo;s data, that puts any third-place finisher trailing way behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the number of Libertarians was substantially lower than two catch-all categories which Winger calls &quot;indp. misc&quot; at 26.8 million and &quot;other&quot; at 2.9 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The miscellaneous category includes states that have a miscellaneous category, as well as voters who write in answers (such as &quot;birthday party&quot;) on their registration. Winger&rsquo;s &quot;other&quot; includes a combination of actual parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since those catch-all categories were large, we picked a couple of states to look in more detail at third-party registrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In California, there were 477,129 registered with the <a href=\"http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ror/ror-pages/15day-general-12/politicalsub1.pdf\">American Independent Party</a>. In <a href=\"http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/enrollment/congress/congress_nov12.pdf\">New York</a>, there were 430,072 registered with the Independence Party as of November 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Winger said those groups in California and New York aren&rsquo;t &quot;nationally organized parties. Those are one-state parties.&quot; That&rsquo;s why when Winger talks about Libertarians&rsquo; voter registration he includes the phrase &quot;nationally organized&quot; -- something the Libertarians in Broward omitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re not suggesting that those state parties in California or New York are powerful players nationwide -- or even in their own states. Some New York voters wrongly think they are registering as <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/voters-victims-article-1.1217271\">independents</a>, according to the <em>New York Daily News</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markham Robinson, a leader with the American Independent Party, told PolitiFact in an interview that he did a survey of AIP voters and of the 200 who responded, one-third didn&rsquo;t realize they had registered with a party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Robinson said he&rsquo;d give that third ranking to his own group based on voter registration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Robinson suggested another way to measure third-party influence: a group&rsquo;s registration as a percentage of total voters. By that method, he gave a shout-out to the <a href=\"http://www.iapn.org/\">Independent American Party</a> in Nevada -- they garnered almost 5 percent of the state&rsquo;s registration as of <a href=\"http://www.nvsos.gov/index.aspx?page=1269\">October</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libertarians do have a point when they say they are growing. Ballot Access News showed in 2008 there were 240,328 Libertarians, compared with 325,807 in 2012, an increase of about 36 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But their power lies not in electing Libertarians but more in the libertarian <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-09/politics/39856656_1_libertarian-party-ron-paul-young-voters\">philosophy</a> making <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/libertarianism-89697_Page2.html\">inroads </a>with the GOP. And some experts told us to examine votes received or the number of candidates who ran as signs of party strength rather than just voter registration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, Libertarian presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/2012/popular-vote.html\">Gary Johnson</a> received about 1.3 million votes -- more than any other third-party candidate. Johnson&#39;s tally, amounting to about 1 percent, is the largest for a non-major-party candidate since Ralph Nader&#39;s Green race in 2000, said J. David Gillespie, author of a book on third parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Libertarians always run far more people for congressional and state legislative seats across the nation than do the Greens, Constitution Party, or any other third party,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some libertarians choose not to register with the Libertarian Party, either because they don&rsquo;t like party labels or so they can participate in the nominating contests held by the major parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libertarians &quot;do have influence beyond their size, because libertarian ideas appeal to people on both left and right,&quot; said Shaun Bowler, a political science professor at the University of California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Libertarian Party in Broward said on its website that the Libertarian Party &quot;is the third-largest political party in the U.S.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quantifying the number of Libertarians is tricky; some states don&rsquo;t track the affiliation. As for those officially registered with the Libertarian Party, it&rsquo;s about 326,000. Some state-based parties -- most notably the Independence Party in New York and the American Independent Party in California -- have more people registered to their party than that, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-09-03T16:25:19.392208", "ruling_date": "2013-09-09T16:34:11", "ruling_headline": "Libertarians say they're the third largest political party", "ruling_headline_slug": "libertarians-say-theyre-third-largest-political-pa", "ruling_link_text": "We're No. 3!
