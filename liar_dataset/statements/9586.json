Jeff Merkley&rsquo;s</a> race against <a href=\"http://www.monicafororegon.com/\">Republican challenger Monica Wehby</a> is already featuring heated back-and-forths on an issue that could be pivotal in November -- the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Oregon continues its recovery from the Great Recession, both candidates are making claims about what could have been done -- and what should be done -- to improve the situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The claim:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Senate Democrats, responding to a call from President Barack Obama, tried in late November 2011 to pass the <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42707\">Rebuild America Jobs Act</a>. The bill called for an immediate $50 billion investment in roads, bridges, airports and transit systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, the bill died when Democrats failed to muster enough votes to break a Republican filibuster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Merkley, in a <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/mapes/index.ssf/2014/07/merkley_vs_wehby_on_the_issues_1.html#incart_river\">recent position statement</a> on jobs and the economy, reiterated his support for the bill, saying it would have created living-wage jobs for Oregon families and financed much needed transportation projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added, &quot;I co-sponsored the Rebuild America Jobs Act to do just that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if that was true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The analysis:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s old news that the act died along largely partisan lines, when Democrats were unable to round up the 60 votes needed to over the filibuster. So we focused on Merkley&rsquo;s claim of co-sponsorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We checked with <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s1769\">GovTrack.us</a>, a non-partisan website that draws from a number of sources to help people find and track bills in Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An overview of the bill, formally numbered S. 1769, showed it was introduced Oct. 31, 2011, by <a href=\"http://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/\">U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn</a>., and reported to committee the next day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A secondary link showed that the bill had 17 original co-sponsors, ranging alphabetically from Sen. Mark Begich, D-AK to Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. Six more senators, including Washington Democrat Maria Cantwell, signed on as co-sponsors in the following 10 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among those 23 senators, Merkley&rsquo;s name was noticeably absent. Since that was at odds with his recent position statement, we emailed his office and asked about the discrepancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lindsey O&rsquo;Brien, Merkley&rsquo;s press secretary, acknowledged that listing the senator as a co-sponsor was incorrect. In an email, she attributed the error to an &quot;editing mistake.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She added, however, that he stands by the act&rsquo;s intent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sen. Merkley was a vocal supporter of the Rebuild America Jobs Act,&quot; O&rsquo;Brien wrote. &quot;He advocated for it on the floor of the Senate, and was proud to support because it meant more middle-class jobs for Oregonians.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The senator&rsquo;s position piece, she said, should have read: &quot;I was a vocal supporter of the Rebuild America Jobs Act to do just that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a floor speech, delivered Nov. 2, 2011, Merkley spoke at length in favor of the bill. Nowhere did he mention being one of its co-sponsors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The ruling:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Merkley, in an &quot;issues&quot; statement on jobs and the economy, said his support for a major 2011 infrastructure spending bill was so strong that he signed on as one of the act&rsquo;s co-sponsors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Merkley did <a href=\"http://votesmart.org/public-statement/650144/rebuild-america-jobs-act-motion-to-proceed#.U78FPVazMTu\">deliver a floor speech</a> promoting the supposed benefits of the failed Rebuild America Jobs Act, but nowhere does his name appear as one of the proposal&rsquo;s 23 co-sponsors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His campaign staff admitted the assertion was a mistake and sent along revised language characterizing Merkley not as a co-sponsor of the act, but as a &quot;vocal supporter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the original submission, however, we rate the senator&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comments?
