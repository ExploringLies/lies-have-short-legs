This is not, however, what the Green family believes, which is that life begins at conception and these drugs impede the survival of fertilized eggs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At any rate,&nbsp;Hobby Lobby stopped covering those drugs in its plan and took the health care contraceptive mandate to court, represented by the Becket Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only caveat here is Hobby Lobby said it didn&rsquo;t know it was covering the drugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Coverage of these drugs was not included knowingly or deliberately by the Green family. Such coverage is out of step with the rest of the Hobby Lobby&rsquo;s policies, which explicitly exclude abortion-causing contraceptive devices and pregnancy-terminating drugs,&quot; the company stated in its court filing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of note, company leaders do not have religious problems with other forms of birth control, such as the pill, condoms, diaphragms and sterilization, according to the family&rsquo;s legal representation, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On CNN, Kohn said, &quot;Hobby Lobby provided this coverage before they decided to drop it to file suit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Christian-owned company did previously offer insurance plans that included coverage of a few contraceptives at issue in the case, namely morning-after pills, but reports suggest owners weren&#39;t aware they offered that coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the company found out -- in the wake of the contraceptive requirements that came out after the health care law -- the company stopped offering the drugs and took the contraceptive mandate to court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kohn&rsquo;s statement is accurate but leaves out that Hobby Lobby says it unwittingly offered this kind of birth control coverage.
