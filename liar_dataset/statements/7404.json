Rumsfeld was a wrestler at Princeton University who tried unsuccessfully to make the U.S. Olympic squad in 1956.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn making his case, Rumsfeld noted that wrestling &quot;once was a favorite of Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe didn&#39;t realize the 16th president had been a wrestler, so we decided to check it out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt didn&#39;t take long: We found Lincoln was so good that he&#39;s enshrined <a href=\"http://nwhof.org/stillwater/hall-of-fame/#type=hof&amp;honoree=129\">in the National Wrestling Hall of Fame</a>, which says he recorded only one defeat in a dozen years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLincoln &quot;was an impressive physical specimen, thin but wiry and muscular, strengthened by hard work in the fields and towering to a mighty 6-feet, 4-inches in height,&quot; says an article on the Hall of Fame&#39;s website.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis most famous bout was against Jack Armstrong, a local bully and wrestling champion in New Salem, Ill. There are <a href=\"http://nwhof.org/stillwater/resources-library/history/wrestling-in-the-usa/\">differing</a> accounts of that bout, but the consensus is that Lincoln held his own against the &quot;local tough.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLincoln &quot;sure was the big buck of this lick,&quot; <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1141550/index.htm#\">said one spectator</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis wrestling skills were celebrated in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-emFOUHuCYE\">a TV ad</a> for Diet Mountain Dew in which Lincoln strips off his shirt during the Lincoln-Douglas debates and begins throwing people off the stage. The tagline: &quot;FACT: Lincoln&#39;s favorite sport was wrestling.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1141550/index.htm#\"><em>Sports Illustrated</em> notes</a> that Lincoln was not our only wrestling president. Other grapplers who made it to the White House include George Washington (school champ at the Reg. James Maury&#39;s Academy in Fredricksburg, Va.), Andrew Jackson, Zachary Taylor, Ulysses S. Grant, Chester A. Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt and &nbsp;William Taft, who &quot;mastered a wicked move called the Flying Marc that savagely flipped an opponent to the ground.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRumsfeld said wrestling was a favorite sport of Lincoln&#39;s. We found lots of documentation of his wrestling prowess, and it&#39;s a reasonable inference to assume he enjoyed it.
