The goal is to prevent young adults from becoming uninsured when their parental or college plans would otherwise run out. This provision took effect in September 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found support for the film&rsquo;s statistic in a <a href=\"http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2011/YoungAdultsACA/ib.shtml#2\">Health and Human Services analysis</a> of data from the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201112.pdf\">National Health Interview Survey</a>, a longstanding survey conducted by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The survey found an 8.3 percentage point increase in insurance coverage for the 19-to-25 age group between the third quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2011 -- from 64.4 percent to 72.7 percent. The analysis then multiplied 8.3 percent by 29.7 million -- the number of people nationally in that age group -- to come up with the number 2.5 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll note that the original CDC study, using slightly different methodology, found a smaller number. Using annual and semi-annual figures rather than quarterly numbers, the number grew by 1.3 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe HHS analysis makes the case that, for various technical reasons, its method is superior. We think both estimates are reasonable, and while the 2.5 million figure got more traction in the media, we also think it&rsquo;s worth noting that the underlying federal study offers an alternative -- and smaller -- number. In essence, the film cherry-picks the higher number. So the statement is accurate but needs clarification, which fits our definition of Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-16T15:52:25.440694", "ruling_date": "2012-03-16T17:14:45", "ruling_headline": "Barack Obama film touts coverage for 2.5 million young Americans", "ruling_headline_slug": "barack-obama-film-touts-coverage-25-million-young-", "ruling_link_text": "Widely cited number, but there's a smaller alternative figure, too", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBarack Obama for President, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/barackobama?source=RoadWeveTraveled-20120315-HP\">The Road We&rsquo;ve Traveled</a>,&quot; Mar. 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDepartent of Health and Human Services, &quot;<a href=\"http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2011/YoungAdultsACA/ib.shtml#2\">2.5 Million Young Adults Gain Health Insurance Due to the Affordable Care Act</a>,&quot; December 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201112.pdf\">Health Insurance Coverage: Early Release of Estimates From the National Health Interview Survey, January&ndash;June 2011</a>,&quot; December 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDepartment of Health and Human Services, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/12/20111214d.html\">New data: Affordable Care Act helps 2.5 million additional young adults get health insurance</a>,&quot; Dec. 14, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaiser Family Foundation, <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8061.pdf\">Summary of New Health Reform Law</a>, accessed Mar. 16, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tBecause of the new health care law, &quot;2.5 million young adults now have coverage.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "the campaign film \"The Road We've Traveled\"", "statement_date": "2012-03-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
