Over an hour every day, five hours a week you don&rsquo;t spend with your family -- 260 hours a year.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis made your PolitiFact Georgia team sad. While we&rsquo;re behind the wheel cursing traffic, we may be missing all of those Hallmark card experiences that are supposed to make the daily grind worthwhile.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA daughter&rsquo;s first steps. Her dance recitals. That magic moment when you realize her boyfriend is no good and you need to run him off with a baseball bat.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs what the ad is saying true?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad was sponsored by the Metro Atlanta Voter Education Network, a group of businesses and civic groups. They are banding together to tell voters about a July 31 referendum that asks voters to raise sales taxes to fund transportation projects across the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLeaders hope to raise $6.14 billion over 10 years for a long list of transportation projects. An additional $1 billion would fund county and town projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBackers say that without it, the region will lose business to other places that are doing more to deal with traffic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad was based on data from a February 2012 report from the Georgia Department of Transportation, a MAVEN spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. The report said that the average work commute time in metro Atlanta was 30.3 minutes in 2010, which is up from 30.1 minutes in 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report cited the 2010 American Community Survey, a yearly national survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. It reported times for a 28-county area surrounding Atlanta. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe number cited in the commercial is the commute time for people traveling from home to work by all modes of transportation, including riding the train, walking, or using a bicycle.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTravel times for those who drive are similar. Those who commute alone in a car, truck or van spent an estimated 29.1 minutes on the road. Those who carpooled spent about 32.6 minutes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf each commute is about 30 minutes, that means the average worker in metro Atlanta spends one hour commuting each day. If you work five days a week, 52 weeks a year, that equals 260 hours, the number cited in the commercial. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found a few problems with this calculation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCommuting expert Alan Pisarski, who frequently writes about transportation issues and testifies before Congress, told PolitiFact Georgia that the American Community Survey is generally the best -- and often only -- source for commute times in metro regions or cities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the survey is limited. It publishes times for trips to work, not trips home. If you&rsquo;re trying to find the average time spent commuting during a whole day, multiplying the ACS survey figure by two won&rsquo;t necessarily give you the right answer. The afternoon commute might be shorter or longer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia also noted that commuters often don&rsquo;t work all 52 weeks in a year. They often get a couple of weeks worth of vacation. The average time spent commuting each year might not be 260 hours. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe hunted for additional data in metro Atlanta, but did not find any recent research. We found nothing that contradicted their numbers, either. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what&rsquo;s our conclusion?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMAVEN&rsquo;s television ad is based on information from the census that says the average trip to work in the Atlanta region is about 30 minutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt was a bit of a leap for MAVEN to conclude that based on morning commute data, metro Atlantans spend &quot;over an hour every day&quot; traveling to and from work.<br />\r\n\tThe afternoon commute might be longer or shorter. We don&rsquo;t know because it&rsquo;s not part of the census data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt was a bigger leap for them to conclude that since the year is 52 weeks long, workers therefore spend &quot;260 hours a year&quot; commuting. Workers often get a week or so of vacation or sick leave.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMAVEN&rsquo;s numbers are OK for a back-of-the-envelope calculation. They&rsquo;re also within reason. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, metro Atlanta is so big and the commutes can be so different that assuming a trip to work takes as much time as the one back home is a bridge too far.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe give MAVEN a Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-22T16:36:46.542820", "ruling_date": "2012-03-23T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ad: Metro Atlantans spend \"260 hours a year\" commuting", "ruling_headline_slug": "ad-commute-takes-260-hours-year", "ruling_link_text": "Ad drives data a bridge too far", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tYou Tube, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCkYsy_Lyj8\">MAVEN -- &lsquo;Calculated Approach&rsquo;</a>&quot; ad, posted March 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia Department of Transportation, <a href=\"http://www.dot.state.ga.us/informationcenter/programs/documents/reports/attachmente-sstp-sb200.pdf\">Statewide Strategic Transportation Plan, Progress Report</a>, February 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/acs/www/\">American Community Survey, Means of Transportation to Work by Selected Characteristics for Workplace Geography</a>, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acs-15.pdf\">Commuting in the United States: 2009</a>,&quot; September 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/transportation-referendum/t-splost-education-campaign-1386639.html\">T-SPLOST &lsquo;education&#39; campaign push starts</a>,&quot; March 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAtlanta Regional Commission, Regional Snapshot, &quot;County-Level Congestion Trends: Jobs Play a Key Role,&quot; March 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Saba Long, spokeswoman, Metro Atlanta Voter Education Network, March 21, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Alan Pisarski, commuting expert, March 21, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Julie Ralston, communications director, Atlanta Regional Commission, March 21, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 1770, "last_name": "Metro Atlanta Voter Education Network", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "metro-atlanta-voter-education-network", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PolitiFact_silhouettes_18.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1770/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tMetro Atlantans spend &quot;over an hour every day&quot; or &quot;five hours a week&quot; commuting, for a total of &quot;260 hours a year.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in a TV ad", "statement_date": "2012-03-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 219, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/219/", "subject": "Message Machine 2012", "subject_slug": "message-machine-2012", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/", "/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
