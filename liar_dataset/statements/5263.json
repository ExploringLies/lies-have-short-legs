These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&bull; <strong>Affordability subsidies.</strong> Lower-income individuals and families receive government subsidies to help pay their health insurance premiums. Subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&bull; <strong>Expansion of Medicaid.</strong> The plan expands Medicaid to all children whose families earn up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&bull; <strong>Insurance market regulation.</strong> In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 may be covered on their parents&#39; plan.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tWe think Santorum&rsquo;s use of the label &quot;top-down&quot; reflects his political opposition to both the Massachusetts plan and the national plan modeled after it. Given that opposition, a person could consider an individual mandate a &quot;top-down&quot; approach to health care, although others would disagree.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut &quot;government-run?&quot; That characterization is simply wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, to explain:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The Massachusetts plan leaves private health insurance intact, and under the Massachusetts plan, health care delivery remains predominantly in private hands, as it was before the law was enacted,&quot; he wrote in an email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The role of government is expanded, but that is not the same as saying the government &lsquo;runs&rsquo; the health system. The Massachusetts plan expanded Medicaid, but at the same time it expanded uninsured residents&rsquo; access to private insurance (through subsidies to buy coverage and the connector).&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat does an actual government-run system look like? Oberlander pointed to the truly socialized system of Great Britain -- as well as to one in our own backyard.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The Massachusetts plan ... looks NOTHING like a true &lsquo;government-run health care system... &nbsp;the VA&rsquo;s health system where the government owns the hospitals and employs doctors directly,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSantorum called Romney&rsquo;s health law &quot;a top-down, government-run health care system.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&nbsp; The individual mandate and the requirement that employers offer health insurance might be considered top-down, though it is still a system that relies heavily on private insurance and private medical providers. But there&rsquo;s no case to for calling it &quot;government-run.&quot;&nbsp; A real government-run system has doctors on the payroll. Massachusetts does not.
