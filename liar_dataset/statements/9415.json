Scott Walker responds to critics of his cuts to education funding by pointing out signs of progress in the state&rsquo;s elementary and high schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State residents look at results, Walker says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For all the hype and hysteria about education, they look at the fact that graduation and third-grade reading scores are up in the state since I took office,&quot; he told WISN-AM (1130) talk host Jay Weber on April 16, 2014. &quot;ACT scores continue to be some of the best in the country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin students&rsquo; longstanding <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/wisconsin-ties-for-second-nationally-in-act-test-scores-b9980125z1-220432501.html\">high-achievement scores on the ACT</a> college-readiness exams (second nationally) are well known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we were interested in what has been happening on the other two measures the governor cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked for backup, Walker campaign spokeswoman Alleigh Marr&eacute; said state Department of Public Instruction data proves the governor&rsquo;s case. And we found it&rsquo;s the best source of data in both areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Finishing high school</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin&rsquo;s statewide public school graduation rate was 85.7 percent in the last full school year (2009-&rsquo;10) before Walker&rsquo;s term started in January 2010, according to the data. The figure counts those who graduate within four years of starting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2010-&rsquo;11, the rate rose to 87 percent. This school year began months before Walker took office, so any policy changes would have had negligible effect on graduation rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results since then:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2011-&rsquo;12: 87.5 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2012-&rsquo;13: 88 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That 88 percent rate was tied for second-best in the country along with Nebraska, Texas and Vermont. Iowa topped the list at 89 percent, DPI reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time Walker spoke on WISN, that 88 percent figure for 2012-&rsquo;13 was not yet public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, we should note that pre-2009 data that is comparable is not available. The new data tracks individual students, while the old method used a different methodology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under any of the scenarios, the arrow is pointing up, though not emphatically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reading Scores</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third-grade readers, the group cited by Walker, are the youngest public-school students to take the annual Wisconsin Knowledge and Concepts Examinations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State officials typically measure progress, or lack thereof, on reading by calculating the number of students deemed &quot;proficient&quot; or &quot;advanced&quot; based on the exams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent history of that figure for third-graders follows a pattern of one-year improvement followed by one-year decline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2005-06: 32.8 percent proficient or advanced</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2006-&rsquo;07: 34.4 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2007-&rsquo;08: 33.9 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2008-&rsquo;09: 35.2 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2009-&rsquo;10: 32.7 percent (last full school year before Walker&rsquo;s election)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2010-&rsquo;11: 34.2 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2011-&rsquo;12: 33.1 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2012-&rsquo;13: 34.9 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2013-&rsquo;14: 34.6 percent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the figure has ping-ponged between about 33 percent and 35 percent. The current figure is higher than most going back nearly a decade, but lower than two of the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been a straight line upward in Walker&rsquo;s time, the figures show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the latest year&rsquo;s count is &quot;up&quot; compared to the baseline year pre-Walker. It&rsquo;s up just slightly compared with 2010-&rsquo;11, and more significantly compared with 2009-&rsquo;10, depending on which is used as the baseline for Walker&rsquo;s term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public schools, of course, are not the only&nbsp;ones receiving state education aid. Under the voucher or &quot;choice&quot; program, private schools in certain districts, most notably Milwaukee, benefit from publicly funded vouchers. We concentrated in this item on public schools because Walker&rsquo;s comments were in the context of responding to criticism of his public-school funding moves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for the record, third-grade reading scores also have improved in the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program since 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did the governor cherry-pick third-graders because they did better?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not really. Reading scores were up as a whole for students in grades 3-8 and grade 10 who take the test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker has made third-grade learning a focal point of his educational platform, and DPI official John Johnson told us that &quot;third-grade reading and eighth-grade mathematics assessments are often pointed to as predictors of future academic success or struggles.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the issue of credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker doesn&rsquo;t directly credit his own policies as responsible for the positive trends. He cited the numbers as part of litany of positive things around the state while discussing voter attitudes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But implicit in Walker&rsquo;s statement is some degree of chest-thumping, of course. He&rsquo;s a candidate seeking re-election, after all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He and his critics no doubt would disagree on his impact on these statistics. But it&rsquo;s clear that longer-term trends are at play here on the shorter time frame Walker cites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said, &quot;Graduation and third grade reading scores are up in the state since I took office.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numbers, in both cases, are up compared with the year before he took office, though the reading scores bounced around some.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some credit may be due prior elected officials, though, because the trend lines haven&rsquo;t really changed much going back deeper into the pre-Walker era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-06-06T11:57:27.265459", "ruling_date": "2014-06-08T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker says Wisconsin graduation rates and third-grade reading scores have risen while he\u2019s been governor", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-says-wisconsin-graduation-rates-and-t", "ruling_link_text": "Part of report card improving", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WISN-AM (1130) podcast of Gov.
