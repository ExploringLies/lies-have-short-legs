Saxby Chambliss. In November, the winner of the July 22 runoff faces Democrat Michelle Nunn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his ad, Kingston claims Perdue&#39;s company took $3 million from the federal stimulus program that Obama created to jump-start the economy. Kingston opposed the stimulus, and some critics say it was a waste of taxpayer money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But is the claim about a Perdue company taking stimulus money true? Or is it more rhetoric than reality? PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kingston is hardly the first candidate to try to discredit an opponent with claims of connections to the president or to one of Obama&rsquo;s polarizing initiatives &ndash; mainly, the health care overhaul, commonly known as Obamacare, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the &quot;stimulus plan.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, Mark Neumann, the leading tea party candidate in Wisconsin&rsquo;s GOP Senate primary, was on the defensive after acknowledging that his company took $80,000 in stimulus money. He lost the primary to former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his ad, Kingston is referring to $3.4 million in stimulus that went to Alliant Energy Co., a Midwest energy holding company that reported $3.2 billion in operating revenue in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perdue, best known for his leadership of Dollar General, has been on Alliant&rsquo;s board of directors since 2001, earning about $1.3 million in directors fees, according to records of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, Perdue reported making between $2.1 million and $8.1 million from investment income and corporate board memberships. At the time, in addition to Alliant&rsquo;s board, he was serving on the board of Sandy Springs-based Graphic Packaging International Inc., California-based Easton-Bell Sports Inc. and Washington-based Liquidity Services Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford said this week that Perdue has acknowledged in the past that he knew of the stimulus grants to Alliant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If he was aware, why didn&rsquo;t he take action to stop them?&quot; Crawford said. &quot;If he didn&rsquo;t take an ownership role in leading the company, why did he take $1 million from the company?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perdue campaign spokesman Derrick Dickey said the ad is representative of &quot;the kind of false and misleading accusations we have come to expect&quot; from Kingston.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perdue didn&rsquo;t receive any stimulus money personally and neither did any company he managed, Dickey said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said Perdue doesn&rsquo;t recall any board of directors vote at Alliant on the stimulus money and isn&rsquo;t a fan of that initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;David believes that overall, like most spending by Washington politicians, the stimulus was a waste of taxpayer money that missed its mark while piling on even more debt,&quot; Dickey said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Perdue&rsquo;s campaign has stressed the need to reduce the federal debt and has a running debt clock on its website.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We attempted to contact Alliant to see whether we could review the minutes of the board of directors&rsquo; meetings, specifically to see whether there were discussions and/or votes on the stimulus money. We didn&rsquo;t receive an immediate response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also reached out to Robert S. Chirinko, a professor at the University of Illinois who specializes in corporate governance issues. We asked him about the fairness of an ad suggesting that the stimulus money went to &quot;one of Perdue&rsquo;s companies&quot; when his role at Alliant is as a member of the board of directors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of a board of directors &quot;are merely the trustees of the company and they represent the shareholders&rsquo; interests,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In principle, the board makes sure the shareholders/owners get treated fairly and applicable laws and regulations are followed. It could well be the case that the board was not involved in the decision to accept stimulus money.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a major company the size of Alliant, &quot;$3.4 million may fly below the board&rsquo;s radar screen,&quot; Chirinko said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kingston ad mentions the $3 million in stimulus funds. But the Kingston camp says much more stimulus money went to Alliant or its affiliates. The company&rsquo;s 2012 annual report shows that it has three wind farms that took at least $64 million in stimulus-provided production tax credits and another that took a $62.4 million stimulus cash grant, Crawford said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hill also has reported that Graphic Packaging, another company that has Perdue on its board, received a $500,000 stimulus grant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perdue&rsquo;s camp suggests Kingston has questions of his own to answer about the stimulus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dickey said Kingston voted against the stimulus but lobbied for and put out press releases about the federal money being received in Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, the ad makes the claim that one of Perdue&rsquo;s companies took stimulus money. Perdue sat on four company boards, including at Alliant. That&rsquo;s a lot different than owning, running or working day to day for a company. We think it&rsquo;s misleading to say Alliant is his company in an attempt to link him to the president&rsquo;s stimulus program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a company with which he has an affiliation, so there is a bit of truth here, but just a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the attack ad statement as Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-06-27T17:19:55.404261", "ruling_date": "2014-06-30T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Is Kingston claim more rhetoric than reality?", "ruling_headline_slug": "kingston-claim-more-rhetoric-reality", "ruling_link_text": "Stimulus money a campaign issue?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>&quot;New Kingston ad ties Perdue to Obama,&quot; The <a href=\"http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/06/18/new-jack-kingston-ad-ties-david-perdue-to-obama/\">Atlanta</a> Journal-Constitution, June 18, 2014,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/political-insider/2013/nov/29/your-daily-jolt-david-perdue-worth-least-119-milli/\">Daily</a> Jolt: &quot;David Perdue worth at least $11.9 million,&quot; The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Friday, November 29, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails with Derrick Dickey, campaign spokesman, David Perdue, GOP candidate for U.S. Senate</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails with Chris Crawford, campaign spokesman for Jack Kingston, GOP candidate for U.S. Senate</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;GOP won&rsquo;t turn down <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/gop-wont-turn-down-stimulus-spending/nQYQd/\">stimulus</a> spending,&quot; The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Oct. 18, 2009,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email with Robert S.
