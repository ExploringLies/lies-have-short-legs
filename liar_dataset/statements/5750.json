He said he&rsquo;s &quot;not so sure of&quot; the idea that owning and carrying guns makes people safer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe also threw out this claim about gun violence: &quot;You know, the bulk of the people who are shot with a weapon &mdash; other than these drug gangs taking on one another &mdash; end up being shot with their own weapon.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to check that out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBiden&rsquo;s office pointed us to data from the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/index.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, which shows that the majority of firearm deaths in the U.S. are by suicide, and most suicides are committed with the deceased&#39;s own gun.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDavid Hemenway, a public health professor at Harvard University, looked at 2009 specifically and noted that the CDC figures show 18,735 firearm suicides; 11,493 firearm homicides; and some 554 unintentional firearm deaths. &quot;The large majority of firearm suicides use their own (or the family gun), while the large majority of firearm homicides are shot with someone else&rsquo;s gun,&quot; Hemenway said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Biden&rsquo;s statement, in Hemenway&rsquo;s estimation, is &quot;very likely true&quot; if Biden was talking only about firearm deaths.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStatistics that include non-fatal shootings paint a different picture, with more resulting from assaults than from suicides.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The estimates of non-fatal shootings are very rough (estimated from under 100 emergency departments), but the CDC estimates from 2009 are only 3,000 plus non-fatal suicide shootings, compared to over 44,000 assault shootings,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIncluding non-fatal shootings in the study group, Hemenway said, makes Biden&rsquo;s statement &quot;very likely untrue&quot; because people don&rsquo;t typically become the victim of assaults with their own guns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDonald Braman, a law professor at George Washington University, also said the statement is &quot;probably technically true but also misleading as most gun fatalities are suicides.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Biden&#39;s claim implies that people are having their weapons turned against them by someone else when, in fact, the modal gun death is probably a debt-ridden farmer,&quot; Braman wrote in an email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe agree that Biden did not seem to be talking about suicides. He was answering a question about self-defense laws and the danger of people putting themselves in harm&rsquo;s way. And certainly the Martin killing was unrelated to suicide.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What Biden seems to be saying,&quot; Braman wrote, &quot;is that the likelihood that you will shoot someone with a gun you buy in self-defense is smaller than the likelihood that you (or someone in your household) will be shot with that same gun. That is technically true unless you start excluding suicides, etc. -- then I don&#39;t know -- and he&#39;s got a point: guns most often injure people in the gun owner&#39;s household, not an intruder or stranger. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;But it is also potentially misleading in two ways. First, it suggests that people who buy guns are more likely to be harmed than protected by a gun they buy. We just don&#39;t have good data on that. &hellip; Second, it suggests that the harms people are suffering are at the hands of others, when (as I pointed out before) most of the time it is a suicide or suicide attempt.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBiden said &quot;the bulk&quot; of people who are shot with a weapon are shot with their own weapon. The numbers that back up that statement refer only to fatal shootings, including a high proportion of suicides. CDC figures show, and our experts verified, that the majority of gun deaths are suicides, and the majority of suicides are committed with a person&rsquo;s own gun or a gun owned by someone in the household.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlthough the numbers for non-fatal shootings are rough, such assaults typically don&#39;t involve the use of the victim&#39;s gun, experts told us. Biden cited a true statistic but left out the important detail and context that he was talking only about fatal shootings, which would include suicides. That meets our definition of Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-16T10:59:59.510386", "ruling_date": "2012-04-16T11:57:15", "ruling_headline": "Biden says most shootings happen with victim\u2019s own gun", "ruling_headline_slug": "biden-says-most-shootings-happen-victims-own-gun", "ruling_link_text": "In fatal shootings, which include suicides", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCBS News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7403928n&amp;tag=morningFlexGridLeft;ftnImageStack\">Face the Nation</a>,&quot; April 1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center at the Harvard School of Public Health, April 11, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Donald Braman, George Washington University law professor, April 11 &amp; 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCenters for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/index.html\">Injury Prevention &amp; Control: Data &amp; Statistics</a>, accessed April 11 &amp; 12, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "U.S. senator", "false_count": 10, "first_name": "Joe", "half_true_count": 21, "home_state": "Delaware", "id": 11, "last_name": "Biden", "mostly_true_count": 16, "name_slug": "joe-biden", "pants_count": 4, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-joebiden.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/11/", "total_count": 78, "true_count": 13, "website": "http://www.joebiden.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;The bulk of the people who are shot with a weapon &mdash; other than these drug gangs taking on one another &mdash; end up being shot with their own weapon.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on \"Face the Nation\"", "statement_date": "2012-04-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 19, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/19/", "subject": "Guns", "subject_slug": "guns", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
