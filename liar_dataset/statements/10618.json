Jeb Bush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Bridge 21st Century posted on its website a reaction to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JebBush/status/572608808666546176\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>March 2 tweet</u></a> Bush sent out about Clinton&rsquo;s use of a private email account while she was Secretary of State. The PAC pointed out that Bush also had used a private account as governor, and had repeatedly defended his own editing of what emails would become part of the Florida public record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Media accounts establish that Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose &ndash; apparently nothing would have stopped the Bush team from selectively leaving out politically problematic emails,&quot; the <a href=\"http://americanbridgepac.org/jeb-bush-hypocrisy-on-email-disclosure/\">American Bridge website</a> read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does Florida&rsquo;s open records law allow Bush (and all other of the state&rsquo;s elected officials) to hand-select what emails they make available to the public? Sure enough, it does, but there&rsquo;s more to it than just letting politicians self-report emails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mail call</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush famously used the personal email address <a href=\"mailto:Jeb@Jeb.org\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Jeb@jeb.org</u></a> for all eight years of his two terms, from 1999 to 2007. He cultivated an open and tech-savvy image by announcing in December 2014 he would post more than 250,000 emails from his time as governor, ahead of a possible 2016 presidential run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February 2015, <a href=\"http://jebbushemails.com/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>jebbushemails.com</u></a> went live with a quarter-million emails and the first chapter of an e-book Bush was writing about being governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are a few things about the release that sometimes get overlooked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, those emails were selected from messages already available from the state archives as of December, so the disclosure wasn&rsquo;t entirely new. Bloomberg reported Bush didn&rsquo;t submit all of his email <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-04/holding-steady-for-hillary\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>until earlier in 2014</u></a> -- more than seven years after he left office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0100-0199/0119/Sections/0119.021.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Sunshine Law states</u></a> an official must turn in records &quot;at the expiration of his or her term of office.&quot; Documentation from the Florida Department of State shows that Bush&rsquo;s public records were transferred to the state archives several times since November 2007, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1687092-bushrecords.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>most recently in June 2014</u></a>. The last batch is described as &quot;Additional 2002-2003 emails.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, and this gets to the heart of what American Bridge said, is that the messages sent to the archives and subsequently posted on Bush&rsquo;s website are only a portion of all his correspondence during his term. Bush in 2007 said that he had <a href=\"http://www.naplesnews.com/news/local-news/jeb_bush_spins_tales_his_time_tallahassee\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>received 550,000 emails</u></a> through the Jeb@jeb.org address -- plus another 2.5 million through his public email address -- so obviously plenty were not included in&nbsp;the batch of about 250,000 that the Bush team posted in February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As American Bridge said, Bush decided what would go to the archives and what wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;The PAC told us that&rsquo;s comparable to Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s situation and is therefore hypocritical. (We&rsquo;ll leave it to readers to decide what&rsquo;s hypocritical and what&rsquo;s not.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush&rsquo;s camp told PolitiFact Florida that he had more than satisfied state reporting requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Governor Bush complied with Florida&rsquo;s broad public records laws for more than 15 years, beyond what was even required by the law,&quot; Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell. &quot;His emails related to state business have been available via requests to the state for that entire period of time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The emails Bush turned over to the state are only the ones he self-selected as pertaining to state business. He left out messages concerning politics, family matters and fundraising -- although there are <a href=\"http://m.apnews.com/ap/db_268748/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=S99olkFp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>several emails from donors</u></a> posted on the site. Bush acknowledged he kept his emails on a <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/jeb-bush-owned-personal-email-server-he-used-governor-n317286\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>private server</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while American Bridge tried to draw a parallel between Bush&rsquo;s self-selection and Clinton&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/mar/12/hillary-clintons-email-did-she-follow-all-rules/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>current dilemma</u></a>, we found nothing to suggest Bush&rsquo;s editing had violated Florida&rsquo;s Sunshine Law. State statute allows officials or an authorized custodian to <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0100-0199/0119/0119.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>determine which emails go into the public record</u></a> based on whether they pertain to state business. The state archives only receive and preserve them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another big difference is that while Clinton was not open about her private email use, Bush was transparent about the fact that he was using a private account, according to First Amendment Foundation president Barbara Petersen. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&rsquo;s nothing in the public records law about personal accounts,&quot; Petersen said about rules in Florida. &quot;Some agencies have policies <em>discouraging </em>the use of personal accounts, but that was after Bush left office.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there is any question that emails had been left out of Bush&rsquo;s disclosure, a person or group could make a public records request and file a civil suit if they think something&rsquo;s missing, she said. State law does allow private inspections of electronic devices if warranted to find missing texts and emails. But no one has made that challenge of Bush, Petersen said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, the emails provide Bush with a talking point leading up to 2016, said Bill Allison, senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation. He&rsquo;s done what Florida law requires and exerted pressure on his presumptive Republican rivals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Once you create the expectation to become transparent about something, people will expect that,&quot; Allison said. &quot;I&rsquo;m not sure this will catch on the same way as health records and tax returns, but it could make it very difficult for candidates who do not comply.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Bridge said &quot;Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush did self-edit which emails were posted on a website he established in February, but the PAC doesn&rsquo;t note one important point: State law allows him to do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-03-13T16:08:39.390112", "ruling_date": "2015-03-13T17:22:42", "ruling_headline": "Jeb Bush edited his own emails, says liberal PAC", "ruling_headline_slug": "liberal-pac-says-jeb-bush-edited-his-own-emails", "ruling_link_text": "State law allows Bush to do that", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>American Bridge, &quot;<a href=\"http://americanbridgepac.org/jeb-bush-hypocrisy-on-email-disclosure/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>MEMO: Jeb Bush Hypocrisy on Email Disclosure</u></a>,&quot;
