He knows America holds a deep and cherished relationship with Israel.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad closes with clips of Romney giving a speech in front of the Old City and praying at the Western Wall.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn another fact-check, we&rsquo;ll look at the ad&rsquo;s claims about Obama&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/07/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-rejects-jerusalem-capital-israel/\">record on Jerusalem</a> as the nation&#39;s capital.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere, we ask, has the president been there?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Before he moved to the White House</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs an Illinois senator, Obama made his first visit to Israel in January of 2006. In 2008, while running for president, he returned on a multi-nation trip to Israel, Jordan, Germany, France and Britain. That trip, like Romney&rsquo;s this year, was designed to bolster his foreign policy credentials.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the time, Obama declared America a friend of Israel and said we &quot;must always stand up for Israel&#39;s right to defend itself.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Romney&rsquo;s ad specified that Obama has not been to Israel &quot;as president,&quot; and that assertion is correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs it turns out, that&rsquo;s not unusual.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur colleagues at the <em>Washington Post</em>&rsquo;s Fact-Checker column delved into the archives of the historian&rsquo;s office at the U.S. State Department. According to <a href=\"http://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/travels/president/israel\">those records</a>, seven of the last 11 presidents (dating back to Harry Truman who was in the White House when Israel was established) never visited Israel.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Obama campaign, when we asked for <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/truth-team/entry/when-presidents-have-traveled-to-israel/\">a response</a>, pointed out that Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were among those who never went to Israel. Democratic Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton were the only ones to visit during their first term. George W. Bush went to Israel twice during his last year in office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat historical context is noteworthy: A majority of the last 11 presidents did not visit Israel. But the Romney ad&rsquo;s claim is still accurate. We rate it True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-06T17:55:14.681836", "ruling_date": "2012-08-07T15:44:38", "ruling_headline": "Mitt Romney says Barack Obama has not visited Israel as president", "ruling_headline_slug": "romney-says-obama-has-not-visited-israel-president", "ruling_link_text": "Number of trips: zero", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1YFdGQqJdE&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Cherished Relationship</a>,&quot; Romney campaign ad, Aug. 5, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Kara Carscaden, Obama campaign, Aug. 6, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Ryan Williams, Romney campaign, Aug. 6, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/obama-knocked-for-not-visiting-israel/2012/08/03/9420de6e-dce3-11e1-8e43-4a3c4375504a_blog.html\">Obama knocked for not visiting Israel</a>,&quot; Aug. 6, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssociated Press, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-jabs-obama-on-us-policy-toward-israel-day-before-republican-visits-jerusalem/2012/07/27/gJQApx4iDX_story.html\">Romney jabs Obama on US policy toward Israel day before Republican visits Jerusalem</a>,&quot; July 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Chicago Tribune</em>, &quot;&#39;Friend of Israel&#39; also woos Palestinians; Visiting Obama focuses on Israel&#39;s right to defend itself, wisdom of support for moderate Arabs,&quot; July 24, 2008, via Nexis<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em> National Journal</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://decoded.nationaljournal.com/2012/08/romney-misleads-with-israel-ad.php\">Romney Misleads with Israel Ad</a>,&quot; Aug. 5, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDepartment of State, Office of the Historian, <a href=\"http://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/travels/president/israel\">Presidents Travels to Israel</a>, accessed Aug. 6, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 34, "current_job": "Former governor", "false_count": 32, "first_name": "Mitt", "half_true_count": 58, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 5, "last_name": "Romney", "mostly_true_count": 33, "name_slug": "mitt-romney", "pants_count": 19, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-mittromney.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/5/", "total_count": 221, "true_count": 30, "website": "http://www.mittromney.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;As president, Barack Obama has never visited Israel.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign ad", "statement_date": "2012-08-05", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 48, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/48/", "subject": "Israel", "subject_slug": "israel", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 219, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/219/", "subject": "Message Machine 2012", "subject_slug": "message-machine-2012", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/", "/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
