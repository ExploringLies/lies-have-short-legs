(The United States had&nbsp;accepted about 2,000 in 2015.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Look, we&rsquo;re facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II, and I think the United States has to do more, and I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in,&quot; Clinton said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said she would be &quot;looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A jump to 65,000 would be a 550 percent increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To put this in context, Clinton has also made it clear that, under her administration, the United States wouldn&#39;t blindly accept anyone from Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clinton campaign pointed us to <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/statements/2015/12/15/comprehensive-plan-to-bolster-homeland-security/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a Dec. 15, 2015, speech</u></a> she made at the University of Minnesota-Minneapolis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We also have to be vigilant in screening and vetting refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals,&quot; Clinton said. &quot; Rigorous vetting already takes place while these refugees are still overseas, and it&rsquo;s a process that historically takes 18 to 24 months.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It would be a cruel irony indeed if ISIS can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from finding new ones,&quot; she said. &quot;So after rigorous screening, we should welcome families fleeing Syria.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said Clinton &quot;plans to massively increase admissions (of Middle East refugees) &hellip; including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has, in fact, said that in response to the refugee crisis she would raise Obama&#39;s limit of 10,000 to 65,000.
