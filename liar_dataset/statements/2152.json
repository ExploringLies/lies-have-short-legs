This man&#39;s been telling lies on television with millions of dollars for weeks now. And I&#39;m going to get an opportunity to finally spend my own money where I talk about the governor&#39;s race.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLater, when reporters suggested that McCollum hasn&#39;t exactly been Mr. Clean Campaigner himself, the candidate bristled.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Well, look, there&#39;s no negative advertising in my campaign at all,&quot; McCollum said. &quot;Some of the outside groups have been running advertising that are pointing out the truth about Mr. Scott and that&#39;s not negative.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo negative advertising at all? As slightly more than casual observers in the governor&#39;s race, we found McCollum&#39;s statement puzzling. To us, the Scott-McCollum primary duel has been filled with plenty of vitriol -- on both sides -- for the better part of three months.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to put our recollection to the test.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&#39;s go to the tapes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, we need to mention that McCollum&#39;s initial TV ad was plenty nice. It features the endorsement of former Gov. Jeb Bush and highlights parts of McCollum&#39;s record as attorney general and his 500,000 jobs plan. The ad, you can see it <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbMIfMa4KHo\" id=\"xdxu\" title=\"here\">here</a>, includes the traditional images of McCollum speaking with groups of voters and then walking and seemingly giving orders or instructions to worker-type folks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcCollum&#39;s second TV ad directly takes on Scott, a former health care CEO who is self-financing his tea party-inspired campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad starts by playing a soundbite from Scott&#39;s own ads. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKR-_eK0Y4A\" id=\"v3x3\" title=\"Then, McCollum jumps in\">Then, McCollum jumps in</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Rick Scott, let&#39;s get real. While your hospitals were profiting from abortions, I voted 100 percent pro-life.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You cashed in helping illegals send American dollars to Mexico. I led the conservative fight to secure our borders and against amnesty.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;And while you pocketed $300 million by ripping off taxpayers, as attorney general, I recovered record millions from Medicaid fraud.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You put profit over principle, and that&#39;s wrong.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it&#39;s McCollum&#39;s next TV ad that comes with all the hallmarks of negative campaigning -- namely grainy photos, haunted house-style music, text flying across the screen, and nary a mention of McCollum.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad is labeled &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-7SKWGKKOg\" id=\"t5dr\" title=\"Innertube\">Innertube</a>&quot; by the McCollum campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He&#39;s a special interest insider whose company defrauded Medicare and taxpayers while he pocketed $300 million,&quot; a narrator says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn another frame of the ad, a narrator says that while Scott has publicly opposed the federal stimulus, he&#39;s involved in companies who received stimulus funds. The claim comes with three images -- stacks of money kind of flopping in a breeze, a screen grab of President Barack Obama and then a screen grab of Scott.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&#39;s more:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>June 10:</b> The <em>St. Petersburg Times </em>gets a hold of a McCollum mailer that is attempting to attack Scott on his abortion position. The front of the mailer has a woman slumped with her back against an industrial style wall, covering her face and pulling her hair. In big red letters that could give a voter the impression of blood, the mailer begins, &quot;It&#39;s a shame,&quot; then continues in white lettering, &quot;it&#39;s clear when it comes to pro-life issues, Rick Scott is ruthless -- his bottom line comes first.&quot; The mailer continues on the back, with more blood-red type, by saying that Scott profited from abortions as CEO of the hospital chain, Columbia/HCA.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>June 27:</b> A robocall from the McCollum campaign:<br />\r\n\t<i>&quot;Meet Mr. Slick -- Rick Scott.</i><br />\r\n\t<i>&quot;He&#39;s been busted twice this week by Florida newspapers for telling whoppers about Bill McCollum.&nbsp; According to the experts, Mr. Slick -- Rick Scott -- and his campaign have been lying about Bill McCollum&#39;s position on the issues of abortion and immigration.</i><br />\r\n\t<i>&quot;Between Obama and Crist, Floridians are tired of typical politicians willing to say anything to be elected. In August Republicans have a choice. Let&#39;s restore principled conservative leadership to Tallahassee. Vote for Bill McCollum.&quot;</i></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<b>June 28:</b> A <a href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/multimedia/archive/00501/Letter_from_Bill_Mc_501003a.pdf\" id=\"swwp\" title=\"fundraising letter by McCollum\">fundraising letter by McCollum</a> calls Scott a &quot;disgraced&quot; and &quot;lousy manager&quot; whose hands are &quot;filthy&quot; regarding Medicaid fraud at Columbia/HCA. &quot;He&#39;s lucky he&#39;s not in prison,&quot; McCollum writes in the letter. &quot;And now with a shameless audacity that would make Bill Clinton blush, he says he wants to bring his business savvy and acumen to Tallahassee.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>July 2: </b>In a web ad, the McCollum campaign says Scott&#39;s excuse -- that he didn&#39;t know about the fraud at Columbia/HCA -- is &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6iO-9xeFYM&amp;feature=player_embedded#%21\" id=\"a73_\" title=\"like saying a mafia kingpin doesn't know about his henchmen's crimes\">like saying a mafia kingpin doesn&#39;t know about his henchmen&#39;s crimes</a>.&quot; As the narrator says the line, a floating head of Scott is given a black fedora and a trench coat. Then money starts flying through the frame of the ad. Then Scott starts to spin in circles and gets bigger. Then someone starts laughing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>July 15:</b> A new mailer, called the <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/34392129/Two-Faces-of-Rick-Scott\" id=\"n83l\" title=\"Two Faces of Rick Scott\">Two Faces of Rick Scott</a> doesn&#39;t include any mention of McCollum. Instead, it claims that &quot;Rick Scott&#39;s company is partners with Playboy&quot; (which PolitiFact Florida rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/jul/19/bill-mccollum/rick-scott-playboy-connection/\" id=\"lw1p\" title=\"Barely True\">Barely True</a>) and that &quot;Rick Scott&#39;s company creates products for the gambling industry.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>July 27: </b><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zBswQgVa34&amp;feature=player_embedded\" id=\"g5.3\" title=\"A new web ad\">A new web ad</a> attacks Scott&#39;s time at Columbia/HCA, saying he got a $310 million golden parachute &quot;courtesy of American taxpayers.&quot; The $310 million represents Scott&#39;s severance package when he left Columbia/HCA. The ad is set to Rick Astley&#39;s song, &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up,&quot; which has become part of a Internet fad called &quot;Rickrolling,&quot; where people think they&#39;re watching one thing, then get bait-and-switched with Astley&#39;s song.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe should note that these are all advertisements by McCollum&#39;s campaign, and not the 527 groups that are supporting his candidacy. That means McCollum has final approval over their content. And we should make clear that Scott&#39;s hands aren&#39;t clean himself (See <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAX7ZGGg4Uw\" id=\"z92e\" title=\"here\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqNnDvvv7Zg\" id=\"p7s5\" title=\"here\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O8miurn8Bg\" id=\"ilmb\" title=\"here\">here</a>, for starters).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDetermining whether McCollum&#39;s ads are all truly &quot;negative,&quot; or rather what politicians like to call &quot;contrast&quot; ads, is something of a subjective exercise. Contrast ads typically say things like &quot;Candidate A is for this, well I&#39;m for that.&quot; Or, &quot;Candidate A says he&#39;ll be tough on crime, but he voted for this.&quot; Leaving some room for leeway, we don&#39;t want to make a blanket statement that everything we found should be classified as negative.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut calling your opponent Mr. Slick, or dressing him up in a fedora and trench coat meets a common-sense definition of negative advertising. So does an abortion mailer with blood-red type, or a TV ad that focuses entirely on your opponent, and uses gimmicks like spooky music and grainy photos. McCollum said &quot;there&#39;s no negative advertising in my campaign at all.&quot; But there&#39;s plenty of evidence to the contrary, and a seasoned campaigner like McCollum has to know it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-29T17:13:40.253033", "ruling_date": "2010-07-29T18:38:32", "ruling_headline": "Negative campaigning?
