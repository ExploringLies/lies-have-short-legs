Unfortunately, Florida is next on the union bosses&#39; hit list. They&#39;re busing protesters to Central Florida right now to harass your courageous representatives.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAre union mercenaries already targeting Florida as the next Wisconsin by busing protesters to staged events? PolitiFact Florida wanted to find out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe chamber ad, which is airing on Central Florida radio markets, is a response to staged rallies outside the district offices of three Seminole County state legislators -- Scott Plakon, Chris Dorworth and Jason Brodeur. Chamber spokeswoman Edie Ousley said the ad actually began airing four hours prior to the 4 p.m. March 3 rallies, and was based on reports about the event-planning that the chamber had acquired.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOusley wouldn&#39;t detail those reports, but she said the protests were organized through large union e-mail lists that included affiliations with groups like MoveOn.org, and members of the former ACORN community organizing group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Providing transportation is classic government-union strategy 101,&quot; Ousley said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe first looked at media reports from the events. The <em>Orlando Sentinel </em>covered the events and wrote about it under the headline &quot;<a href=\"http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2011-03-03/features/os-seminole-teachers-protest-030411-20110303_1_tie-teacher-teacher-protests-public-school-teachers\">Seminole teachers picket lawmakers over merit pay, pensions</a>.&quot; <em>Sentinel </em>writer Dave Weber described the protest at Plakon&#39;s Longwood office, saying that about 60 teachers and supporters protested plans to tie teacher pay raises to student test score results and a plan to make teachers take a de facto pay cut by forcing them to contribute to their retirement. Weber never mentioned busing and quoted only a local teacher, Melissa Cole.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&#39;s what Weber told us via e-mail: &quot;I was at one of the three protest sites in Seminole, by a strip mall in a busy suburban roadway area just off I-4 in Longwood. There were no buses around and I did not perceive anyone had been bused in. I recognized many of the teachers. Had no sense that anyone was there who did not belong. Those I interviewed by random selection all were local teachers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <em>Sanford Herald </em>covered the protest of Brodeur&#39;s office in Sanford. <a href=\"http://mysanfordherald.com/view/full_story/12202310/article-Teachers-protest-proposed-cuts?instance=news_page\">Writer Gary Roberts described the crowd as being more than 60 teachers</a> and support staff and said that &quot;mourners&quot; dressed in black and carried R.I.P. signs. They were &quot;decrying proposed cuts in the education budget and collective-bargaining rights, along with a merit-pay system that would develop teacher-performance evaluations that are at least 50 percent based on student-learning growth,&quot; Roberts wrote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRoberts quoted local special education teacher Katie Murphy as saying: &quot;We want to make sure the teacher&#39;s voice is heard. Strong schools must have strong teachers, and we need to have a strong voice.&quot; Again, no mention of buses. Roberts told us in an interview on March 7 that there were no buses. &quot;They were teachers,&quot; Roberts said. &quot;They were not professional demonstrators.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were unable to find news coverage of the protest of Dorworth&#39;s office in Heathrow.&nbsp;Katie Betta, a spokeswoman in the House speaker&#39;s office, said Dorworth received around 50 notecards from protesters urging him to not attack teachers. Protesters mostly filled out the cards anonymously, she said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe rally was organized by Gay Parker of the Seminole Education Association, so we asked her whether people were bused as part of the protest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That&#39;s just a lie,&quot; Parker said. &quot;There&#39;s no other way to describe it. The chamber was trying to create a scene that was non-existent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tParker said the protesters were made up of teachers, education officials and parents of students. The closest thing to a bus was a person in a wheelchair who needed to take a special van to reach the protest. Here&#39;s the <a href=\"http://seminole-educators.org/Site/graphics/PDF/Seminole%20Uprising.pdf\">write-up of the event</a> provided by the Seminole Education Association. A total of about 300 people participated, the teacher association estimated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tParker provided PolitiFact Florida with what she said was the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0Bw6LtLEJqtdcZDlmN2NkZDYtYWY5OS00ZjcwLWE4NDgtYmI0NjY5NTM3MmQy&amp;hl=en\">original e-mail announcing the protests</a>. Parker said the e-mail was sent to a list-serve made up of members of the Seminole Education Association. The e-mail asks protesters to call a number to RSVP and to identify which rally they would be attending. The e-mail also asks people to show up 10 minutes before the protest was set to begin to organize the crowds. The e-mail, if accurate, makes no mention of busing or offers buses to attend the protests, nor does it reference MoveOn.org or ACORN. (MoveOn.org is promoting a series of rallies in more than two dozen <a href=\"http://www.awakethestate.com\">Florida cities being organized for March 8 by a group of progressives, Democrats and union sympathizers</a>. But&nbsp;those rallies, part of something called Awake the State, were created independently of the Seminole County teacher protest&nbsp;)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLastly, we talked to Plakon, the lone legislator at his office during the protest. Plakon said he spent more than an hour with the protesters. He didn&#39;t notice any buses, and said most of the people he talked to seemed to be local teachers, though he didn&#39;t ask everyone where they were from.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;I think most of them came from our area, but I didn&#39;t specifically ask them,&quot; Plakon said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPlakon told us he heard the chamber radio ad. He&nbsp;said that as early as the morning of the protest, he had no idea if 10 people would be showing up at his office, or 500. &quot;I would have believed either of those numbers,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOusley, with the chamber, offered no evidence that anyone was bused in. She said that it&#39;s possible the chamber&#39;s ad -- which started airing before the 4 p.m. rallies started -- might have stopped the busing from happening. &quot;It&#39;s highly possible (the ad) diffused protesters from arriving via organized transportation like buses,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven if that&#39;s true, it still makes the ad wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA quick note: Our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin have looked into the protesters gathered in Wisconsin as well. <a href=\"http://politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/23/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-out-staters-accoun/\">You can read their work here</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Florida Chamber of Commerce said government unions bused protesters to a series of Central Florida rallies on March 3. They didn&#39;t. This claim is not only wrong, based on the evidence, but it plays on stereotypes of government unions to try to demonize union workers (in this case, teachers). The Truth-O-Meter sees through the rhetoric.
