I made a mistake. It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed, and as I&rsquo;ve said and now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing, and many other people in the government.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a couple problems with Clinton&rsquo;s talking point that her State Department predecessors used email practices similar to hers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s the fact that most of Clinton&rsquo;s predecessors did not regularly use email. Just four former secretaries of state have held the job during the prominence of electronic communications: Clinton, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/clinton-backers-defend-email\">According to MSNBC</a>, an aide for Albright said she &quot;did not use email while she was in office&quot; from 1997 to 2001. And Rice, head of the State Department from 2005-09, was not a habitual emailer either, according to multiple reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that leaves Powell, a regular email user, as Clinton&rsquo;s only predecessor who serves as a useful comparison. When we reached out to the Clinton campaign, they pointed us to Powell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like Clinton, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/colin-powell-personal-email-secretary-of-state-115707\">Powell used a personal email address</a>. However, there&rsquo;s a big difference: Clinton hosted her email on a private server located in her home. Powell did not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/hillary-clinton-email-escapades-muckreads\">Many politicians</a> use private addresses, but private servers like the one Clinton used are rarely seen, said John Wonderlich, a policy director at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group focused on government transparency, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/18/howard-dean/howard-dean-tremendous-number-public-officials-hav/\">for a prior PolitiFact story</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there&rsquo;s a big difference between a private account, which is generally free and simple to start, and a private server, which requires a more <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/how-to-run-your-own-e-mail-server-with-your-own-domain-part-1/\">elaborate setup</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Atlantic</em> <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/how-to-set-up-a-clinton-style-home-server/387841/\">speculated</a> the Clintons &quot;may have wanted to be in control of the encryption of their correspondence, ensuring that no third parties &mdash; whether commercial, hacker, or government &mdash; were able to snoop on them.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The unorthodox approach has opened up questions about her system&rsquo;s level of security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the server was managed without the help of a third party, &quot;you would have to have a staff that&rsquo;s keeping up with all the latest fixes,&quot; said Clifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern California&rsquo;s Center for Computer System Security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/fbi-colin-powell-email-probe-218748\">State Department has flagged</a> a handful of emails containing information now deemed classified that were received by Powell and aides to Rice at private email addresses. In the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clinton-on-her-private-server-wrote-104-emails-the-government-says-are-classified/2016/03/05/11e2ee06-dbd6-11e5-81ae-7491b9b9e7df_story.html\">more than 50,000 pages</a> of Clinton emails the State Department has reviewed, just over 100 sent by Clinton have been deemed classified, according to a <em>Washington Post</em>&nbsp;analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s unclear whether the information was classified at the time the emails were sent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, regarding her State Department email practices, &quot;my predecessors did the same thing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a misleading claim chiefly because only one prior secretary of state regularly used email, Colin Powell. Powell did use a personal email address for government business, however he did not use a private server kept at his home, as Clinton did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-03-09T21:29:41.670239", "ruling_date": "2016-03-09T22:34:48", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton said 'my predecessors did the same thing' with email", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-said-my-predecessors-did-same-thin", "ruling_link_text": "One predecessor, not the same thing", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/08/charles-schumer/fact-checking-chuck-schumers-defense-hillary-clint/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Fact-checking Chuck Schumer&#39;s defense of Hillary Clinton&#39;s private email,</u></a>&quot; March 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/18/howard-dean/howard-dean-tremendous-number-public-officials-hav/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Howard Dean: &#39;Tremendous&#39; number of public officials have done what Hillary Clinton did with email,</u></a>&quot; Aug. 18, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/03/10/among-ex-secretary-of-states-clinton-stands-out-on-email-use/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Among Ex-Secretary of States, Clinton Stands Out (on Email Use)</u></a>,&quot; March 10, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/us/politics/state-dept-classified-data-found-ex-secretaries-personal-email-john-kerry-condeleezza-rice-colin-powell.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Classified Data Found in Personal Email of Colin Powell and Aides to Condoleezza Rice,</u></a>&quot; Feb. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post, </em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clinton-on-her-private-server-wrote-104-emails-the-government-says-are-classified/2016/03/05/11e2ee06-dbd6-11e5-81ae-7491b9b9e7df_story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Clinton, on her private server, wrote 104 emails the government says are classified,</u></a>&quot; March 5, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Regarding her State Department email practices, &quot;my predecessors did the same thing.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Univision/Washington Post Democratic debate", "statement_date": "2016-03-09", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 115, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/115/", "subject": "Technology", "subject_slug": "technology", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
