Why do they say that?&quot; Carson continued. &quot;Because of the high homicide rate, particularly in our large, inner cities; because there are more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than there are in higher education.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are there more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than in college?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Previous factcheck </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back Carson&rsquo;s statement, a spokeswoman for his presidential exploratory committee initially cited a December 2014 factcheck from PolitiFact Rhode Island that touched on the first part of Carson&rsquo;s statement. That<strong> </strong>factcheck was on a&nbsp;claim that there were more African-American men in prison or jail, or on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850. Our colleagues <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2014/dec/07/diego-arene-morley/brown-u-student-leader-more-african-american-men-p/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>rated it True</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that rating doesn&rsquo;t help Carson&rsquo;s claim, given that the figures pertained to all adult black males in the criminal justice system, rather than young ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted the spokeswoman again, she cited statistics for black males ages 18 to 24, which would correspond to young black males in college. The statistics cited for involvement in the criminal justice system&nbsp;are from<strong> </strong>a U.S. Department of Justice <a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/aus9010.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>report on arrests</u></a> in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that report counted the number of <em>arrests</em> of black people, not the number of black <em>people</em> arrested. Some people, of course, get arrested more than once in a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from that, there&rsquo;s also an issue with using arrests as a definition for being involved in the criminal justice system.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s no dispute that someone who is in jail or prison, or is on probation or parole, is involved in the system. But many arrests go away without any criminal charges being filed. And not all charges result in convictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Involvement in the criminal justice system is usually defined as being in prison or jail or being on probation, parole, or pretrial supervision,&quot; Craig Prins, research director of the Public Safety Performance Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts, told us. &quot;Even under that standard definition, it&rsquo;s very difficult to say with certainty how these numbers stack up because the data rarely identify offenders across all three variables of age, race, and sex.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed,<strong> </strong>as we&rsquo;ll see, the federal government does not produce many criminal justice statistics that count black males ages 18 to 24.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Criminal justice system</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted the Department of Justice about Carson&rsquo;s claim and were referred to several reports for the latest figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=datool&amp;surl=/arrests/index.cfm#\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Arrests</u></a>: There were nearly 3 million arrests of black adults in 2012. (And again, that&rsquo;s a count of arrests, not people.) But there is no breakdown for black males ages 18 to 24.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p13.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Prison inmates</u></a>: There were 526,000 black males in state and federal prisons in 2013. About 14.3 percent, or roughly 75,000, were between the ages of 18 and 24.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/jim13st.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Jail inmates</u></a>: There were 261,500 black people in local jails in mid-2013. But there was no breakdown for the 18 to 24 age group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ppus13.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Probation and parole</u></a>: More than 4.75 million adults of all races were on probation, parole, or some other type of supervision in 2013. But no breakdown by age is available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, there is only one solid figure -- 75,000 black males ages 18 to 24 in prison. We&rsquo;re not aware of any recent counts of the black males in that age group who were arrested, in jail, or on probation or parole at a particular time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Higher education </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The higher education part of Carson&rsquo;s claim is easier to sort out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Census Bureau counts by race and with age breakdowns the number of people enrolled in school. For higher education, that includes full- and part-time students in universities and&nbsp;colleges, technical colleges and other institutions that award two-year degrees,&nbsp;and professional schools such as law schools that award advanced degrees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest figures, for 2013, show there were <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/school/data/cps/2013/tables.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>690,000</u></a> males in college, ages 18 to 24, who listed black as their race. The number grows to <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/school/data/cps/2013/tables.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>779,000</u></a> if you include males who identified themselves as black and some other race, such as Asian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carson stated: &quot;There are more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than there are in higher education,&quot; later saying he was referring to the 18 to 24 age group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carson did not provide evidence that backs his claim. The latest federal figures we found show 75,000 black males in that age group who were in prison in 2013 and in the range of 690,000 to 779,000 who were in college. We are not aware of any recent figures for the number of black males ages 18 to 24 arrested, in jail, or on probation or parole at any particular time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If figures do surface, we&rsquo;ll re-evaluate this item, but we rate Carson&rsquo;s claim False.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/politifact-presidential-candidate-ben-carson-on-the-plight-of-young-black-men-b99494701z1-302809591.html\">web page</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-05-05T12:40:24.347270", "ruling_date": "2015-05-05T11:38:54", "ruling_headline": "More young black men in criminal justice system than college, presidential hopeful Ben Carson says", "ruling_headline_slug": "more-black-men-criminal-justice-system-college-pre", "ruling_link_text": "Not enough criminal justice figures available for 18-24 age group", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/ben-carson-stresses-family-faith-in-milwaukee-visit-b99486948z1-301014041.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Ben Carson stresses family, faith in Milwaukee visit,&quot;</u></a> April 22, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview and email exchange, Ben Carson spokeswoman Stephanie Marshall, April 27, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Rhode Island, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2014/dec/07/diego-arene-morley/brown-u-student-leader-more-african-american-men-p/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Brown U. student leader: More African-American men in prison system now than were enslaved in 1850,&quot;</u></a> Dec. 7, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Georgia, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2013/sep/06/jimmy-carter/carter-cites-number-argue-kings-dream-not-reality/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Carter&rsquo;s numbers largely on target,&quot;</u></a> Sept. 6, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Public Radio, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2013/04/23/178601467/are-there-really-more-black-men-in-prison-than-college\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Are there really more black men in prison than college?</u></a> April 23, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview and email exchange, Howard University &nbsp;Associate Professor of Counseling Psychology <a href=\"https://www.howard.edu/schooleducation/departments/hdpes/HDPES_Faculty.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Ivory Toldson</u></a>, April 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vox, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/2/12/8020959/black-men-prison-college\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;The myth that there are more black men in prison than in college, debunked in one chart,&quot;</u></a> Feb. 12, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, U.S. Department of Justice statistician E.
