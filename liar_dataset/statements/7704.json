Currently, unconventional drilling employment supports 38,000 jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tThe multi-state analysis uses a specific figure of 38,830 jobs for Ohio in 2012. It breaks those into three categories.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tIt says that 4,200 of the jobs were directly involved in the oil and gas industry, or in &quot;activities required to explore, produce, transport and deliver products.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tAnother 13,601 were classified as indirectly involved, or employed in activities in outside industries that supply materials and services to the developers.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tThe largest number of jobs -- 21,020 -- are identified as &quot;induced&quot; jobs. The report says that &nbsp;&quot;Induced jobs are those that meet the new demand for consumer goods created by the increased income generated by the direct and indirect jobs,&quot; or &quot;workers spending their wages and salaries on consumer goods and household items.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tThe induced and other jobs are broken down in 15 industry categories that include administrative and support services; food services and drinking places; wholesalers, health care, construction, real estate and insurance.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\t&quot;All other industries&quot; account for 11,115 of the induced jobs -- by far, the largest employment category for 2012.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tThe source cited for the numbers in the IHS report is IHS Global Insight. IHS told us the direct jobs count came from federally published data, principally the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The remaining 34,000 jobs were the result of standard economic modeling from the published data.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tOne of the authors of the IHS report, managing director of economic analysis Mohsen Bonakdarpour, told us that the figures for 2012 could be seen as a snapshot of the average number of jobs, full-time and part-time, supported by oil and gas drilling during the year.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tWe also asked about the term &quot;cross-state contributions,&quot; found deeper in the report.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tBonakdarpour said it refers to material or personnel from another state. For example, he said, drillers in Pennsylvania might require equipment available from Oklahoma. The amount of cross-state contribution would be expected to diminish as the industry grows and matures in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tWe thought that was pertinent because media reports on shale gas have found a significant number of <a href=\"http://marcellusdrilling.com/2012/06/does-shale-gas-drilling-create-jobs-for-in-state-residents/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">out-of-state workers</a>, and Gov.

But the state cannot determine the residence of workers in the data.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tIn a report issued in March, &quot;<a href=\"http://urban.csuohio.edu/publications/hill/OhioUticaShaleRegionMonitor_Mar2013.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Ohio Utica Shale Region Monitor</a>,&quot; researchers at Cleveland State University&#39;s Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs found a spending surge in 2012 but not many new jobs.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tThe researchers analyzed total employment for 2011 and 2012 in 13 eastern Ohio counties where shale gas and oil production was underway, and compared the data to the rest of the state. They found that <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2013/03/ohio_shale_gas_development_pro.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">employment growth due to shale development</a> was not evident: employment rose 1.4 percent year-over-year in counties with heavy or moderate shale production, compared to 1.3 percent in other counties without shale development.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio is not rating either the benefits or drawbacks of drilling. We are checking the statement, from the OOGA ad, that &quot;nearly 40,000 new jobs have been created in the last year due to the new wells... right here in Ohio.&quot;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tThe figure of &quot;nearly 40,000&quot; is an accurate reference to the IHS report. And the ad&#39;s reference to jobs &quot;in all walks of life&quot; does indicate that the jobs net is being cast over a wide area not solely restricted to drilling.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tBut the reality and relevance of the number in the context of the ad is undermined considerably by the fact that it is not the result of surveying but of modeling; that fewer than half of its nearly 40,000 jobs are directly or indirectly related to drilling, and that the single largest element -- almost 30 percent of the jobs total -- consists of unidentified &quot;induced&quot; jobs.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tWe think the ad&#39;s reference to the creation of new jobs would reasonably be taken as referring to permanent or continuing jobs, not temporary employment.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tFurther, the touting of jobs &quot;right here in Ohio&quot; that are &quot;restoring Ohio&#39;s heritage&quot; is not supported by the substantial percentage of jobs going to out-of-state workers, &nbsp;even if that percentage is diminishing.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tFinally, the IHS report says its figure of 38,830 jobs refers to total jobs supported by drilling during 2012, not to new jobs created in the year, as the ad claims.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tAnd the words matter. The IHS report itself makes clear that there is a difference between jobs that are &quot;created&quot; by the industry -- which, in a generous reckoning, would encompass direct and indirect jobs -- and jobs that are &quot;supported,&quot; which would be all of the 21,020 induced jobs.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s an important distinction that the ad ignores, and it accounts for more than half the jobs that the ad claims.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tSo the association has misrepresented its own industry&rsquo;s study with compounded exaggerations.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tThe Truth-O-Meter says Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-04-26T16:30:28.181624", "ruling_date": "2013-04-29T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ohio Oil and Gas Association touts 40,000 new Ohio jobs", "ruling_headline_slug": "ohio-oil-and-gas-association-touts-40000-new-ohio-", "ruling_link_text": "One exaggeration after another", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-1261a2e7-4809-ef43-b369-57c2bbcc1b78\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tOhio Oil and Gas Association, &quot;<a href=\"http://ooga.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">40,000 jobs</a>,&quot;
