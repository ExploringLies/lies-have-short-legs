to the future of the entitlement program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In Washington, Congressman Joe Heck supports privatizing it, turning our savings over to Wall Street and risking it on the stock market.&quot;&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrVO-y7Hcow\">ad says</a>. &quot;Heck&#39;s plan means billions more for&nbsp;Wall Street, and they&#39;ve donated over half a million dollars to his campaign.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The donations aspect of the ad is relatively straightforward, as the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;type=I&amp;cid=N00031244&amp;newMem=N&amp;recs=20\">securities and investment industry</a> has donated $525,569 to Heck throughout his congressional career, according to an OpenSecrets.com tally (roughly 73 percent of that sum coming during his current Senate run).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the main claim of the ad, that Heck would &quot;privatize&quot; Social Security and subsequently jeopardize the program&rsquo;s fiscal stability, is one that PolitiFact and other <a href=\"http://lasvegassun.com/news/2010/sep/10/politics-program-are-all-about-risk/\">Nevada</a> <a href=\"http://lasvegassun.com/blogs/nevada-wonk/2010/aug/31/union-ad-inaccurate-again/\">journalists </a>have called <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/15/hillary-clinton/clinton-exaggerates-republicans-plan-privatize-soc/\">inaccurate</a> on <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/feb/17/florida-democratic-party/democrats-say-david-jolly-david-jolly-supports-pri/\">multiple</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-republican-leaders-plan-privat/\">occasions</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democrats have used the specter of Republican-led efforts to privatize Social Security as a political boogeyman since at least 2005, when then-President George W. Bush unsuccessfully proposed a <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/why-the-2005-social-security-initiative-failed-and-what-it-means-for-the-future/\">plan</a> to quasi-privatize the entitlement program for younger workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many Republicans (not just Heck and Bush) have supported adding optional private accounts for younger workers as a way to extend the life of the entitlement program, which is <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/\">scheduled to run out of reserve funds in 2034</a> and be unable to pay out full benefits to future beneficiaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what Heck has actually proposed or has mentioned as a potential change for the entitlement program:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/11/heck-pivots-social-security-joe-knows-jobs-tour/31497421/\">Indexing the retirement age</a> from 67 to 69 by one month per year for the next 24 years;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Allowing younger workers to voluntarily invest retirement funds directed toward Social Security into other private markets;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Possibly raising the cap on earnings to which the Social Security tax applies (<a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/cbb.html\">$118,500</a> in 2015).</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s that second point that AFSCME says backs up the claim that Heck wants to &quot;privatize&quot; Social Security. (Heck calls it a &quot;diversified investment.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is somewhat of an argument over semantics: Is Heck&rsquo;s proposal privatization or not? PolitiFact has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/22/ann-mclane-kuster/ann-mclane-kuster-accused-charlie-bass-wanting-pri/\">generally found</a> that support for voluntary private Social Security accounts for younger workers doesn&rsquo;t merit the sort of concerns or consequences implied by a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-republican-leaders-plan-privat/\">full privatization</a>&quot; of the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vast majority of Republicans, including <a href=\"https://heck.house.gov/issues/seniors\">Heck</a>, say they&rsquo;re adamantly opposed to making any changes that would affect those already receiving benefits or about to enter the program. It&rsquo;s misleading of the ad to suggest that Nevada senior citizens could lose &quot;our savings&quot; given that Heck has never called for changes to be made for current beneficiaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AFSCME did point to several reports on the potential fiscal cost of a quasi-privatized option, most of which were published <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/la-fi-wallstreet18jan1805-story.html\">nearly a decade ago</a> when the Bush administration was pushing for changes to the entitlement program. Heck was elected to Congress in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the ad points out, Bush&rsquo;s plan to shift to a partially privatized version of Social Security would likely lead to billions of <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6746628/ns/business-eye_on_the_economy/t/wall-street-steers-clear-social-security-debate/#.V6z5mfkrKCh\">dollars in fees</a> for the brokerages and mutual fund businesses who would oversee the new individual accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heck has previously said he&rsquo;s more concerned about securing retirement for individuals than ensuring the future solvency of the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s not about making Social Security solvent,&quot; Heck said to the <a href=\"http://lasvegassun.com/news/2010/sep/10/politics-program-are-all-about-risk/\">Las Vegas Sun</a> in 2010. &quot;It&rsquo;s about securing people&rsquo;s retirement.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, Heck did join House Republicans in a <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll178.xml\">vote</a> against <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/15/house-section/article/H1811-5\">an amendment</a> that would have prohibited the use of appropriated funds to cut or &quot;privatize&quot; Social Security and other entitlements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heck campaign spokesman Brian Baluta said in an email that private investments could potentially entail anything from U.S. Treasury securities, annuities, CDs, money market funds, interest-bearing savings accounts or employer-matched retirement savings account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But all this is moot, because it&rsquo;s a theoretical discussion about how to address the long-range insolvency of (Social Security),&quot; Baluta said in an email. &quot;There is no Joe Heck plan to privatize Social Security.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time AFSCME has gone after Heck on this particular issue &mdash; the union was sharply criticized over a similar ad in 2010 by <a href=\"http://lasvegassun.com/blogs/nevada-wonk/2010/aug/31/union-ad-inaccurate-again/\">journalists</a> including Jon Ralston, who accused the union of &quot;<a href=\"http://lasvegassun.com/blogs/nevada-wonk/2010/aug/25/afscme-ad-against-joe-heck-full-inaccuracies/\">blatant fear mongering.</a>&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new AFSCME ad claims that Heck &quot;supports privatizing (Social Security), turning our savings over to Wall Street, and risking it on the stock market.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heck has stated an openness to supporting optional, private retirement accounts for people under a certain age as an alternative to the existing Social Security program, but AFSCME is bending the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite what the ad implies, Heck has never suggested a mandatory privatization of the entitlement system that would forcibly &quot;turn our savings over to Wall Street.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because this ad is partially accurate but takes things way out of context, we rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2e5621fe-e15c-4d76-97bf-10e670c5c320\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2e5621fe-e15c-4d76-97bf-10e670c5c320</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-15T11:58:14.738253", "ruling_date": "2016-08-15T12:02:25", "ruling_headline": "Union-backed ad repeats inaccurate claim that Joe Heck wants to privatize Social Security", "ruling_headline_slug": "union-backed-ad-repeats-inaccurate-claim-joe-heck-", "ruling_link_text": "Same group, same inaccurate ad from 2010", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Brian Baluta, Joe Heck campaign spokesman, Aug. 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Tiffany Ricci, AFSCME spokeswoman, Aug. 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KTNV, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ktnv.com/news/ralston/afscme-coming-with-seven-figure-buy-against-joe-heck\">Union coming with seven-figure buy against Joe Heck</a>,&quot;
