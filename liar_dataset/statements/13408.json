In a speech before the <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2016/10/263653.htm\">Chicago Council on Global Affairs</a>, Kerry bemoaned a persistent misconception about how much money Washington sends overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Do you know that amazing surveys show that many of our citizens think we devote a full quarter or even a third of our federal budget to foreign aid?&quot; Kerry said on Oct. 26, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign aid covers both military aid and more humanitarian forms of assistance such as fighting disease and boosting economic growth in other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kerry&rsquo;s comment accurately reflects what pollsters have seen for many years. Americans greatly exaggerate the scale of those items compared to everything else Washington spends on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do our part to set the record straight, this chart comes from numbers in the president&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2017/assets/budget.pdf\">2017 budget request</a>. There are <a href=\"http://beta.foreignassistance.gov/\">different ways</a> to tally expenses across more than a dozen agencies, but by and large, foreign aid represents about 1 percent of all spending.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed center\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To support Kerry&rsquo;s claim, the State Department press office pointed to several reports including a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a widely respected source of impartial data. In <a href=\"http://kff.org/global-health-policy/poll-finding/americans-views-on-the-u-s-role-in-global-health/\">January 2016</a>, Kaiser found that only 3 percent of Americans correctly estimated spending at 1 percent or less of total spending. The average answer was that foreign aid accounts for 31 percent of the U.S. budget; 15 percent of the people thought it represented over half of all spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/czmLXLA1KSQmxtiah9IbaIY121s0kyK-zdc8XcxeDGAuqu0CsFzdTJOoP_IFNRWnGkZe-xkv9Ctt4x4H932lyJTTcJ-uv0aIc94rokXXy6vi5XsskgfCe315OGmSMOqYmQYDG4S7\" style=\"border:none; height:358px; width:447px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That misconception is a stubborn one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.uvm.edu/~dguber/POLS234/articles/gilens2.pdf\">1998 survey</a>, the average answer put foreign aid at 26 percent of the budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And decades before that, nearly a quarter of respondents in a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwiJbAWhwPe_bWJTZVRuclYxVmYwQVpPVjhWaFFGMmdBTVBN\">1963 Gallup poll</a> said Washington spends between 10 to 25 percent of its budget on foreign aid. Another 13 percent said it might go as high as half of all government spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the surveys back-up Kerry&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which raises the question, why do so many people get it wrong?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many possible reasons. The first and most obvious factor is that most Americans might not know much about foreign aid. In a 2010 poll, almost 70 percent said they had heard about the World Bank, but less that 30 percent had heard about the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government&rsquo;s main overseas health and development body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boston College political scientist Emily Thorson points the finger at a more fundamental problem. It seems we aren&rsquo;t very good with numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;People don&rsquo;t think in terms of percentages,&quot; Thorson said. &quot;We do best with &lsquo;more than&rsquo; and &#39;less than.&rsquo; And they also don&rsquo;t have a sense of how big the federal budget is. So if they hear we&rsquo;re spending billions, they don&rsquo;t see how that can be a small slice of the total.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers Helen Milner and Dustin Tingley, professors at Harvard and Princeton universities respectively, suggested that the way surveys ask about foreign aid might make that problem worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No study that we are aware of asks individuals to assign percentages to an array of government programs, with a mandatory limit at 100 percent,&quot; they <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2256916\">wrote in 2013</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, asking only about foreign aid might lead people to ignore the big ticket budget lines for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also possible, Thorson said, that news coverage that touches on aid can be graphic and compelling -- such as scenes from refugee camps or fighter jets in flight -- which leaves the impression that these programs play a bigger role in the budget than they actually do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kerry said that surveys show that many Americans think that a quarter to a third of the U.S. budget is spent on foreign aid. The actual number is about 1 percent, and surveys back&nbsp;up Kerry&rsquo;s statement. One 2016 poll found the average estimate was about 30 percent of all government spending. A survey done nearly two decades ago found an average estimate of 26 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong about Kerry&rsquo;s summary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/abaebb34-ae3b-41cf-8c1c-6b7ed1c8a219\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/abaebb34-ae3b-41cf-8c1c-6b7ed1c8a219</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-11-02T17:28:15.903490", "ruling_date": "2016-11-09T07:40:55", "ruling_headline": "Most people clueless on U.S. foreign aid spending", "ruling_headline_slug": "yep-most-people-clueless-us-foreign-aid-spending", "ruling_link_text": "Survey says .. he's right!", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>U.S. State Department, <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2016/10/263653.htm\">Remarks at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs</a>, Oct. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Family Foundation, <a href=\"http://kff.org/global-health-policy/poll-finding/americans-views-on-the-u-s-role-in-global-health/\">Americans&#39; Views on the U.S. Role in Global Health</a>, Jan. 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Office of Management and Budget, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2017/assets/budget.pdf\">Fiscal year 2017 budget</a>, Feb. 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/11/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-foreign-aid-less-1-percent-federa/\">Marco Rubio says foreign aid is less than 1 percent of federal budget</a>, March 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>International Interactions, <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2256916\">Public opinion and foreign aid: A review essay</a>, Nov. 24, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Political Science Review, <a href=\"http://www.uvm.edu/~dguber/POLS234/articles/gilens2.pdf\">Political Ignorance and Collective Policy Preferences</a>, June 2001</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/26/the-u-s-foreign-aid-budget-visualized/\">The U.S. foreign-aid budget, visualized</a>, Sept. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Press Institute, <a href=\"http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Project-2-Thorson-2015-Identifying-Political-Misperceptions-UPDATED-4-24.pdf\">Identifying and Correcting Policy Misperceptions</a>, April 23, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Emily Thorson, assistant professor, Department of Political Science, Boston College, Nov. 3, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "Secretary of State", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 65, "last_name": "Kerry", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "john-kerry", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-johnkerry.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/65/", "total_count": 14, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Surveys show that many of our citizens think we devote a full quarter or even a third of our federal budget to foreign aid.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs", "statement_date": "2016-10-26", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Most people clueless on U.S. foreign aid spending"}
