Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., was asked to explain her 2005 vote to offer gun manufacturers liability protections during a <a href=\"http://www.capradio.org/articles/2016/05/10/california-counts-front-runner-harris-target-in-us-senate%C2%A0debate/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>debate</u></a> in the U.S.Senate race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanchez never really directly answered the question but said that the law didn&rsquo;t give gun manufacturers &quot;blanket immunity.&quot; She then pivoted to talk about her support from the nation&rsquo;s leading gun control group, the <u><a href=\"http://www.bradycampaign.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence</a>.</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Brady Campaign has given me a 100 percent, not 99, 100 percent rating,&quot; Sanchez said May 10, 2016. &quot;They say I&rsquo;m not a lap dog to the gun lobby, and they say I don&rsquo;t take their money.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Brady Campaign did say that. But they said a lot of other things -- including some not-so-positive comments on Sanchez&rsquo;s 2005 vote. We&rsquo;ll walk you through it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sanchez on gun issues</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Sanchez supports several gun-control measures, such as a mandatory waiting period, a ban on high-capacity magazines and universal background checks, she did vote for the 2005 bill that granted gun makers immunity from lawsuits based on the misuse of their products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To many in the gun control community, this is a blemish on her record, and in April, Sanchez wrote <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/soapbox/article73430062.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>an op-ed</u></a> in the <em>Sacramento Bee</em> defending that vote. She noted that the full package included some gun control measures, but it was her concern for &quot;unintended consequences&quot; that played as large a role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I voted for it to prevent frivolous lawsuits against manufacturers,&quot; Sanchez said. &quot;If someone uses a baseball bat or hammer to assault you, should the manufacturers be held criminally liable? If you said &lsquo;no,&rsquo; then you agree with the principle behind the 2005 law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Brady Campaign wasn&rsquo;t buying it. Four days after Sanchez&rsquo;s op-ed, the organization issued a <a href=\"http://www.bradycampaign.org/press-room/sanchez-dead-wrong-on-gun-industry-protections\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>press release</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Loretta Sanchez is dead wrong,&quot; said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign. &quot;I find it excruciatingly frustrating that she claimed to have &#39;fully analyzed unintended consequences&#39; of the law and saw fit to support it nonetheless.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gross said unlike an auto maker who can be sued, the victims of gun violence have no legal recourse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The choice between a victim&#39;s right to justice and the possibility of inconveniencing the multibillion dollar gun industry is not a &#39;tough decision&#39;, nor is it &#39;complicated&#39;,&quot; Gross said. &quot;Loretta Sanchez is standing on the wrong side of this issue.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ratings from the Brady Campaign, NRA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanchez is correct that she received a 100 percent rating from the Brady Campaign in its most recent rankings, which cover the 2013-14 Congress. This was called the &quot;<a href=\"http://lapdogscorecard.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Lap Dog</u></a>&quot; scorecard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, according to votesmart.org, she has been nicked by the group in the past. Her &quot;<a href=\"http://votesmart.org/interest-group/122/rating/5070#.VzK7YYQrKM8\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>lifetime score</u></a>&quot; with the group, which covers only 1991-2009, was 81 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the flip side of the coin, the National Rifle Association has given Sanchez a grade of F in her past two terms, and before that, Ds going back to 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;She cannot defend her vote by parroting the gun lobby&#39;s misleading talking points and she cannot sweep this problem under the rug by laying claim to decade-old ratings,&quot; Gross said in his press release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did not hear back from Sanchez&rsquo;s campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanchez said the Brady Campaign has given her a 100 percent rating. They have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But she&rsquo;s cherry-picking the evidence that puts her in the best light. In reality, the gun-control group just recently wrote a scathing rebuke for Sanchez&rsquo;s defence of her position on gun maker liability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And she hasn&rsquo;t always received a 100 percent rating with the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanchez&rsquo;s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7123d3ff-2250-4556-a4d6-590309bdfdaf\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7123d3ff-2250-4556-a4d6-590309bdfdaf</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-05-11T00:02:25.445931", "ruling_date": "2016-05-11T01:20:16", "ruling_headline": "Loretta Sanchez dodges question about gun liability vote, cites Brady campaign support", "ruling_headline_slug": "loretta-sanchez-dodges-question-about-gun-liabilit", "ruling_link_text": "She left out the not-so-nice stuff they said", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>KQED News, <a href=\"http://www.capradio.org/articles/2016/05/10/california-counts-front-runner-harris-target-in-us-senate%C2%A0debate/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>U.S. Senate debate</u></a>, May 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sacramento Bee, <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/soapbox/article73430062.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Another View: Law isn&rsquo;t a gift to gunmakers</u></a>, April 22, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brady Campaign, <a href=\"http://www.bradycampaign.org/press-room/sanchez-dead-wrong-on-gun-industry-protections\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Sanchez dead wrong on gun industry protections</u></a>, April 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Project Vote Smart, <a href=\"http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/203/loretta-sanchez/37#.VzK6v_krLDc\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Loretta&nbsp;Sanchez - ratings and endorsements: gun issues</u></a>, accessed May 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "member of Congress", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Loretta", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "California", "id": 270, "last_name": "Sanchez", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "loretta-sanchez", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/Sanchez.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/270/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.lorettasanchez.house.gov/"}, "statement": "<div id=\":14h.ma\" style=\"margin-left:9px;\" title=\"5/10/16, 11:33 PM\">&quot;The Brady Campaign has given me a 100 percent, not 99, 100 percent rating.&quot;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "a debate", "statement_date": "2016-05-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 19, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/19/", "subject": "Guns", "subject_slug": "guns", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
