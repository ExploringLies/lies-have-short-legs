Romney has acknowledged that this is the case.\n<p>\n When Romney ran for office in Massachusetts &mdash; unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 1994 and successfully for governor in 2002 &mdash; he often said he supported abortion rights.\n</p>\n<p>\n McCain's ad highlights a few of those statements.\r\n\r\n\"I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country,\" Romney said in a 1994 debate with Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy.\n</p>\n<p>\n In a 2002 debate, Romney said there was no difference between his views and that of his Democratic opponent, Shannon P. O'Brien. \"I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose, and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard,\" Romney said.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 2007, Romney said his views have changed. \"And I get tired of people that are holier than thou because they've been prolife longer than I have,\" he said at a Republican debate on Aug. 5, 2007.\n</p>\n<p>\n (\n <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/\">\n  PolitiFact.com\n </a>\n looked at Romney's abortion record previously; check out our stories\n <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/33/\">\n  here\n </a>\n and\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/142/\">\n  here\n </a>\n .)\n</p>\n<p>\n McCain's ad accurately conveys Romney's positions now and during the previous times Romney has run for office.
