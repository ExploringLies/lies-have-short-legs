Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, upset. Fasano, who regularly argues on behalf of&nbsp; &quot;the little guy or gal,&quot; recently told <em><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/energy/progress-energy-insists-approach-to-bungled-nuclear-power-project-was/1196193\"><em>St. Petersburg Times</em></a></em> that he was concerned the latest $2.5 billion repair price tag -- which includes paying for the fuel to replace the energy generated by the nuclear plant -- would overburden the company&#39;s Tampa Bay and Central Florida ratepayers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo hammer home the point, Fasano offered an interesting detail about the power bill Progress Energy customers pay each month.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Already, just a little over 60 percent of your electric bill, my electric bill, 60 percent of that is pass-throughs, whether they be for building of nuclear plants or whatever they may be,&quot; Fasano said. &quot;This (repair) will only increase that percentage.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis fact-check will address two points. First, does 60 percent of a Progress Energy customer&#39;s bill pay for something called &quot;pass-throughs&quot; (and just what is that)? And second, will the repair of the damaged nuclear plant make things worse?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>They pay, so you pay</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe term &quot;pass-through&quot; is what it sounds like: Certain costs that get passed through to utility customers. The utility pays, so you pay.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that&#39;s an oversimplification. So let us explain.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"https://www.progress-energy.com/florida/home/index.page\">Progress Energy Florida</a>&nbsp;is an investor-owned company regulated by the state&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.psc.state.fl.us/\">Public Service Commission</a>. The commission makes the rules and sets the rates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are <a href=\"http://www.floridapsc.com/publications/pdf/electricgas/DecouplingReport_To_Legislature.pdf\">two pieces to your electric bill</a>, the &quot;base rate&quot; and &quot;cost recovery clauses.&quot; The base rate doesn&#39;t often change.<strong> </strong>It only gets adjusted when a utility applies to the commission for a new base rate. That can be a lengthy and burdensome process, so a base rate might stay in place for years. The base rate compensates a utility for producing and delivering electricity, plus investment in its plants and facilities, plus an &quot;allowed return&quot; -- you might call it profit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAgain, that&#39;s the base rate. Then there are the &quot;cost recovery clauses.&quot; Some costs -- say, for example, fuel -- rise and fall dramatically. So the commission lets a utility file a different type of request each year to pass those costs directly to you, rather than include them in its base rate. If fuel ends up costing less in a given year, ratepayers get some money back. If it costs more, well, ratepayers shell out extra. That&#39;s the essence of a pass-through.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe should note that while pass-throughs get speedier review than a proposed change to the base rate, they&#39;re not automatic. They still have to be approved by the Public Service Commission.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Florida, fuel costs are handled as a pass-through, as are expenses related to energy efficiency programs and environmental compliance. Then there&#39;s a relatively recent,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/energy/progress-energy-customers-could-soon-pay-much-more-for-levy-county-nuclear/1184329\">and controversial</a>, pass-through -- for new nuclear power. That&#39;s the one that allows Progress Energy to charge you for planning and construction costs years before a project actually produces any energy. Right now, a little less than 5 percent of a typical Progress Energy residential bill helps pay for a Levy County plant that may be&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/energy/article1185702.ece\">more than a decade away</a>, plus a project to boost capacity at the Crystal River plant that&#39;s offline for unrelated repairs.<strong> </strong>(The Crystal River nuclear plant is the one that prompted Fasano&#39;s comments germane to this fact-check.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn coming years, that chunk could&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/energy/progress-energy-customers-could-soon-pay-much-more-for-levy-county-nuclear/1184329\">soar dramatically</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Percentages</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo test Fasano&#39;s claim that &quot;just a little over 60 percent of your electric bill ... is pass-throughs,&quot; we asked Progress Energy Florida for a breakdown. Spokeswoman Suzanne Grant provided these numbers, which show that fuel costs make up the biggest chunk of a typical 1,000 kilowatt-hour residential bill, followed by the base rate that pays for essentials from power lines to energy workers:&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<table border=\"1\" bordercolor=\"#000000\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" id=\"porr\" style=\"font-size: 1em;

It&#39;s been out for the count ever since.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome of the costs associated with the plant shutdown are pass-throughs -- more costly fuel.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Progress has had to turn to more expensive sources to replace the nuclear power, such as natural gas, boosting the typical residential bill by $3.82, according to the company.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNext year, the Crystal River outage could add $4.70 a month -- again, because replacement fuel costs more than nuclear power -- meaning your bill could be nearly 4 percent higher than it would have been.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe hit would be worse, but Progress Energy&#39;s insurance coverage has picked up quite a bit. Still, the future&#39;s not exciting: The company&#39;s coverage for replacement power expires in August 2012, according the public counsel&#39;s office, more than a year before the nuclear plant&#39;s fixed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>St. Petersburg Times</em> reporter Ivan Penn wrote that &quot;the utility has projected there will be an additional $1 billion in replacement power and fuel costs until the plant comes back online, with customers paying about $560 million of that cost.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMeanwhile, some of the price tag -- for the physical repairs to the plant itself -- isn&#39;t a pass-through, according to the Public Service Commission. So you won&#39;t see it for a while. If Progress wants its customers to pay for what&#39;s not covered by insurance, that would&nbsp;have to be part of a change to the base rate. And Progress&#39; current agreement with the commission means no base rate update through the end of 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFasano said, &quot;Already, just a little over 60 percent of your electric bill, my electric bill, 60 percent of that is pass-throughs, whether they be for building of nuclear plants or whatever they may be. This (repair) will only increase that percentage.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPass-throughs actually represent just under 60 percent of a Progress Energy bill, so he&#39;s close.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut there&#39;s two caveats to Fasano&#39;s claim. The first is just what constitutes a pass-through. A casual reader of Fasano&#39;s statement might imagine that the bulk of a customer&#39;s bill goes to big projects unrelated to the power they consume, rather than to something as central as fuel -- and fuel represents by far the largest pass-through cost.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSecond, the problems with the Crystal River plant create some pass-through costs -- through paying for more expensive fuel -- and possibly some non-pass-through costs, namely the physical repairs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn balance, we rate Fasano&#39;s statement Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-17T16:45:40.308264", "ruling_date": "2011-10-18T16:38:01", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
