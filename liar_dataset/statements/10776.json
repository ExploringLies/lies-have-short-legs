And President Obama said he was going to stop them, and clearly he didn&#39;t.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama has relied heavily on drones -- nearly 2,500 people have been killed in covert drone strikes since Obama took office, according to the <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2015/02/02/almost-2500-killed-covert-us-drone-strikes-obama-inauguration/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bureau for Investigative Journalism</u></a>, which tracks strikes.
