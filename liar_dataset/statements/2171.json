It showed that unemployment has been 9 percent or higher for 14 months running, from May 2009 to June 2010. That&#39;s well short of the two years Boehner suggested. And before the downturn, it never got close to being as bad as Boehner claims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBLS&#39; searchable figures go back to 1948, so we looked through the full data to find historical comparisons. Since 1948, there have only been two periods prior to the current stretch when unemployment exceeded 9 percent. There was a one-month blip in May 1975, and then a 19-month period between March 1982 and September 1983 when unemployment never dipped below 9 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPre-1948 data is not as comprehensive, but a BLS study shows that things were far, far worse during the Great Depression. The estimated annual unemployment rates stayed above 9 percent for more than a decade -- from 1931 to 1941. Between 1932 and 1935, the unemployment rate exceeded 20 percent in each year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe considered the possibility that Boehner might have simply misspoken, intending to say that unemployment had exceeded 8 percent for two consecutive years. But that isn&#39;t correct either. If you go back a full two years, the unemployment rate in July 2008 was 5.8 percent. From today&#39;s vantage point, that seems like a whole lifetime ago.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo any way you look at it, Boehner&#39;s statistic was wrong. We rate his statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-03T11:57:39.513294", "ruling_date": "2010-08-03T12:28:01", "ruling_headline": "John Boehner says unemployment has exceeded 9 percent for two years running", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-boehner-says-unemployment-has-exceeded-9-perc", "ruling_link_text": "In July '08, unemployment was 5.8 percent (remember that?)", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tJohn Boehner, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/transcript/sen-mcconnell-rep-boehner-discuss-game-plan-midterms?page=2\" id=\"jypc\" title=\"comments\">comments</a> on <em>Fox News Sunday</em>, Aug. 1, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?ln\" id=\"tx_6\" title=\"main search page\">main search page</a> for Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey, accessed Aug. 3, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/opub/cwc/cm20030124ar03p1.htm\" id=\"llhf\" title=\"Compensation from before World War I through the Great Depression\">Compensation from before World War I through the Great Depression</a>,&quot; Jan. 30, 2003</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 13, "current_job": "Speaker of the House of Representatives", "false_count": 22, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 49, "last_name": "Boehner", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "john-boehner", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-johnboehner.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/49/", "total_count": 69, "true_count": 17, "website": "http://www.speaker.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;This is the first time since the Depression that unemployment has stayed above 9 percent for two consecutive years.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on \"Fox News Sunday\"", "statement_date": "2010-08-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 42, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/42/", "subject": "History", "subject_slug": "history", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "John Boehner gets his unemployment statistics wrong on Fox News Sunday"}
