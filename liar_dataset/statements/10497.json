It sought another $1.2 billion in new bonding above Doyle&rsquo;s original proposal. Then the Legislature added in another $900 million and -- in the end -- Doyle signed off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That increased the total to the $3.6 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, more typically, the Legislature has reduced the borrowing sought by the executive branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That could happen this year, too. Plus Walker says he will not propose any new borrowing in the capital budget that goes through the Building Commission. (Instead, he will use <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-bypasses-gas-tax-hike-wants-13-billion-in-transportation-bonds-b99436196z1-290377171.html\">$858 million</a> in previously authorized bonding authority and repurpose it for capital projects, but that tactic is not unusual, and those figures are not included in the Fiscal Bureau&rsquo;s tracking of new borrowing.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, another wildcard is the UW System, whose building projects typically make up a big chunk of state borrowing. If Walker&rsquo;s plan to spin the system off under a new authority is approved, it could seek borrowing on its own, effectively removing that item from the state&rsquo;s books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That makes a comparison to 2009 a bit sticky as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said his plan borrows $2 billion less than Doyle&rsquo;s last budget and is the lowest borrowing level in a decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s accurate if you compare the adopted budgets from that time to Walker&rsquo;s proposed budget for 2015-&rsquo;17 (which is all you can do right now).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the claim needs clarification because Walker&rsquo;s comparing his early-stage proposal to a 2009 final enacted budget after lawmakers and Doyle pumped it up. We rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>------</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>More on Scott Walker</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#39;s Scott Walker page</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-02-09T16:35:01.369968", "ruling_date": "2015-02-10T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker says his proposed borrowing is lowest in a decade", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-says-his-proposed-borrowing-lowest-de", "ruling_link_text": "Lawmakers could push it lower", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Transcript of Gov.
