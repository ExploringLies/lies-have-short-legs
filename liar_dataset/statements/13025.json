I think that would be very disastrous for our military veterans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if Republican nominee Donald Trump has proposed or supports privatization of the health care system for U.S. veterans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump, for the record, addressed the question head on when it was his turn to answer questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I never said take the VA -- take the Veterans administration -- private.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that,&quot; Trump added. &quot;I do believe, when you&#39;re waiting in line six, seven days, you should never be in a position like that. You go out, you see the (private) doctor, you get yourself taken care of.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&#39;s comments are consistent with what he&#39;s said before, and Clinton&#39;s concerns about privatization are a misleading Democratic talking point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine said that &quot;Donald Trump is a guy who has called for privatization&quot; of the VA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we found then, and what holds now, is that Trump wants to give veterans access to private providers when they face delays at the VA. That&#39;s not the same as privatization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted Clinton&#39;s campaign about her statement, spokesman Josh Schwerin sent us several references where Trump&#39;s plan has been characterized as some degree of privatization and Trump&rsquo;s explicit promise to give veterans the chance to go elsewhere for care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Every veteran will get timely access to top quality medical care. Every veteran,&quot; Trump pledged in a July 11, 2016, speech in Virginia Beach, Va. &quot;Veterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center. We must extend this right to all veterans, not just those who can&rsquo;t get an appointment in 30 days or who live more than 40 miles from a VA hospital, which is, unfortunately, the current and wrong policy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The logistics of how that would work, of course, are another matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has spoken of letting VA patients go to any doctor or health care facility that accepts Medicare and getting treatment there immediately. The VA would pay for the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts we spoke with raised several issues with Trump&rsquo;s plan and also debated whether Trump&#39;s plan should be considered a type of partial privatization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One concern is that non-VA providers don&rsquo;t have the same level of experience that the VA has with treating veteran&#39;s health issues &mdash; including combat injuries, combat-related illnesses and mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s also concern that letting veterans go anywhere for their care would result in fragmented, uncoordinated, and lower-quality care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said Donald Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Affairs health care system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump does support allowing more privatized care in cases where treatment at the VA is delayed or inadequate. In some cases he&#39;s talked about giving veterans a choice that would include doctors and hospitals outside the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&#39;s not the same as privatizing the system, which would get the get the government out of the treatment business. Trump has never proposed that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because Clinton&#39;s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e782bf2-269d-45f2-9c69-c527093c99f2\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e782bf2-269d-45f2-9c69-c527093c99f2</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-07T22:10:21.527955", "ruling_date": "2016-09-07T22:32:00", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump supports privatizing the VA health care system", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-supports-privati", "ruling_link_text": "Letting vets go outside the system isn't privatization", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/25/tim-kaine/does-donald-trump-want-privatize-va/\">Does Donald Trump want to privatize the VA?</a>&quot; July 25, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Josh Schwerin, spokesman, Hillary Clinton campaign, Sept. 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV6r4AfZYy4\">Full Event: Donald Trump Speech on Veterans&#39; Reform in Virginia Beach, VA (July 11, 2016)</a>,&quot; Donald Trump Speeches &amp; Events channel</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Donald Trump supports &quot;an agenda out there&quot; to privatize the Veterans Affairs&nbsp;health care system.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "the NBC Commander-In-Chief Forum ", "statement_date": "2016-09-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
