Kent Conrad, D-N.D., on <em>This Week with Christiane Amanpour</em>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The American people say, don&#39;t touch Social Security, don&#39;t touch Medicare, don&#39;t cut defense,&quot; Conrad said. &quot;That&#39;s 84 percent of the federal budget. If you can&#39;t touch 84 percent of the federal budget -- and, by the way, they also don&#39;t want to touch revenue -- you&#39;re down to 16 percent of the budget at a time we&#39;re borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;So, you know, there needs to be leadership to help the American people understand how serious this problem is and that it&#39;s going to take a lot more than cutting foreign aid and taxing the rich. You&#39;re not going to solve the problem that way.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tConrad was one of three senators who appeared on <i>This Week</i> to discuss bipartisanship. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, also appeared. All three have announced they intend to retire in 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wanted to check Conrad&#39;s statement that &quot;we&#39;re borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend.&quot; We looked at whether Social Security, Medicare and defense constituted 84 percent of the federal budget in a <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/27/kent-conrad/kent-conrad-said-84-percent-budget-social-security/\">different fact-check</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe turned to the U.S. Treasury Department&#39;s Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government. For the most recently completed fiscal year, 2010, the department reported that the government had revenues of $2.16 trillion, spending of $3.46 trillion and a deficit of $1.29 trillion. Divide the deficit by the outlays and you get 37 percent, which is very close to 40 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe initially found the numbers a little confusing, but one of the experts we interviewed for this story explained it this way:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s like a family that earns $60,000 per year, but is spending $100,000. How are they doing it? By getting a new $40,000 loan every year to cover the difference,&quot; said Brian Riedl, a budget expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn rating Conrad&#39;s statement, we find he correctly described how much the government is borrowing in comparison with what it&#39;s spending.
