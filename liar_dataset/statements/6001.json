This is the second claim PolitiFact Ohio has looked at from this ad. We previously <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/may/30/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-sherrod-brown-cast-deciding-vote-/\" target=\"blank\">rated as False</a> a claim that Brown &quot;cast the deciding vote on a government takeover of health care.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne of the treasurer&#39;s responsibilities is to invest money for local governments through the STAR (State Treasury Asset Reserve) Ohio investment fund, an investment pool with assets of more than $4.1 billion. The Mandel campaign confirmed that the claim in the ad refers to the AAA rating that Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s gave the STAR Ohio fund. It confirmed that rating in a letter to the state last August.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandel made a similar claim in an email to supporters last October, saying then that the fund &quot;just received the highest possible credit rating one of these funds can receive.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/oct/27/josh-mandel/ohio-treasurer-josh-mandel-touts-investment-pools-/\" target=\"blank\">rated that claim Half True</a>. We found that the statement&#39;s wording, especially that the fund &quot;just&quot; received its rating, gave the impression that the rating had improved under Mandel.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, the rating had been in place for 16 years -- since 1995, the first year the fund was rated by S&amp;P.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPublic finance experts said the treasurer did deserve some credit for maintaining that rating.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKevin O&rsquo;Brien, executive director at the Center for Public Management in the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University, noted then that the highest praise should be reserved for the fund managers who maintained the rating during the financial crisis in 2008.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandel deserves credit for maintaining the rating his staff inherited when he took office in January 2011, said O&rsquo;Brien, a former financial analyst for Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service, another credit rating agency. &quot;They maintained the bond rating; they didn&#39;t achieve the bond rating.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim in the new ad, though similar to the email claim, is more carefully worded. It does not imply that the state&rsquo;s rating had &quot;just&quot; improved. But knowing the credit rating has been at that level for more than a decade and a half provides a clearer picture.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandel&rsquo;s statement is accurate but needs additional information to provide clarification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-30T17:33:09.092261", "ruling_date": "2012-05-31T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Josh Mandel campaign claims he 'earned the highest possible crediting ratings as state treasurer'", "ruling_headline_slug": "josh-mandel-campaign-claims-he-earned-highest-poss", "ruling_link_text": "Preserved the high rating he inherited", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tJosh Mandel Campaign, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSzAZlZBdMY&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Change</a>,&quot; May 23, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail from Mandel campaign, May 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/oct/27/josh-mandel/ohio-treasurer-josh-mandel-touts-investment-pools-/\">Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel touts investment pool&#39;s credit rating</a>,&quot; Oct. 27, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFactCheck.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://factcheck.org/2012/05/mandels-deceptive-defense-against-sen-brown/\">Mandel&rsquo;s Deceptive Defense Against Sen.
