Rick Perry&#39;s re-election campaign, and he sounded that theme again in Thursday&#39;s debate. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison tried to take him down a few notches.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;And, oh, by the way, we definitely lost more jobs in Texas this year than we gained,&quot; she said. &quot;We lost 300,000 jobs in Texas alone this year. That is not a record to be proud of.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe couldn&#39;t let Perry sit on his laurels without checking Hutchison&#39;s claim.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter clarifying that &quot;this year&quot; meant 2009, her campaign provided data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that showed Texas lost 271,700 jobs between November 2008 and November 2009.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry&#39;s campaign didn&#39;t respond to our query &mdash; is Hutchison correct? &mdash; so we turned to the Texas Workforce Commission, which supplies the federal labor bureau with Texas&#39; seasonally-adjusted employment numbers (farm jobs not included).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnn Hatchitt, the commission&#39;s director of communications, said Hutchison is right, and &quot;there&#39;s certainly no problem in rounding that up to 300,000 jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe bottom line: Texas had a net job loss of 271,700 jobs, which means the state did lose more jobs than it gained. Nearly 300,000.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat net job loss stands in contrast to 2007-08, when Texas led the nation in net job gains, as the Perry campaign frequently notes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStay tuned for Jan. 22 when the commission updates its data with December&#39;s employment rate. And again in March, when number crunchers fine-tune their report.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUntil then, we rate Hutchison&#39;s claim True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-15T18:42:54.341528", "ruling_date": "2010-01-15T17:41:12", "ruling_headline": "Hutchison says Texas lost more jobs than it gained in 2009", "ruling_headline_slug": "hutchison-says-texas-lost-more-jobs-it-gained-2009", "ruling_link_text": "She wants guv to join the jobless", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tInterview with Ann Hatchitt, Texas Workforce Commission communications director, Jan. 15</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTexas Workforce Commission, State and national nonagricultural employment estimates (seasonally adjusted), November 2008-2009</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/laus.nr0.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Economic news release: Regional and State employment and unemployment summary,</a> Dec. 18, 2009</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "Kay Bailey", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 287, "last_name": "Hutchison", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "kay-bailey-hutchison", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/hutchisonmug7.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/287/", "total_count": 18, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://texans.forkay.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;We definitely lost way more jobs in Texas this year than we gained &mdash; we lost 300,000 jobs in Texas alone this year.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "a debate.", "statement_date": "2010-01-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
