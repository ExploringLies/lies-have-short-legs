(The post says, &quot;The list speaks for itself we think.&quot;)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe undated post attributes the information to OpenSecrets.org, a nonpartisan website that includes a campaign finance database. So that&rsquo;s where we went to verify the information.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCampaign finance rankings change as new donations come in and are recorded in the database, so the accuracy might depend on how recently the Facebook list was compiled.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt turns out that, as of April 27, 2012, OpenSecrets.org&rsquo;s &quot;top contributors&quot; lists closely matched the Facebook post for both candidates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=N00000286\">Romney&rsquo;s top six</a>:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t1. <strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>($564,580)<br />\r\n\t2. <strong>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</strong>. ($400,675)<br />\r\n\t3. <strong>Bank of America </strong>($364,850)<br />\r\n\t4. <strong>Morgan Stanley </strong>($363,550)<br />\r\n\t5. <strong>Credit Suisse Group </strong>($316,160)<br />\r\n\t6. <strong>Citigroup Inc </strong>($286,015)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, five of the six top &quot;contributors&quot; to Romney were identical on the two lists, and the new addition was Bank of America, another financial institution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=N00009638\">Obama&rsquo;s top six</a>:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t1. <strong>Microsoft Corp</strong>. ($304,690)<br />\r\n\t2. <strong>DLA Piper </strong>($302,527)<br />\r\n\t3. <strong>University of California </strong>($243,486)<br />\r\n\t4. <strong>Sidley Austin LLP </strong>($234,611)<br />\r\n\t5. <strong>Google Inc</strong>. ($191,719)<br />\r\n\t6. <strong>Harvard University </strong>($177,408)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnce again, five of the six match, with the newcomer to the list -- Sidley Austin LLP -- a law and lobbying firm.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are two problems with the lists, however.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first is that it&rsquo;s not really accurate to call DLA Piper a &quot;legal group specializing in technology.&quot; It&rsquo;s a <a href=\"http://www.dlapiper.com\">global law firm</a> that also does lobbying; its law and lobbying clients are widely scattered in various industries and sectors and it has <a href=\"http://www.dlapiper.com/global/about/facts/\">4,200 lawyers in 77 offices in 31 countries</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe firm does represent some technology clients, but in the past few years, it has also filed lobbying disclosure forms for its representation of energy companies, drugmakers, food companies, defense contractors, hotel chains and a grab bag of others, from the PGA Tour to General Cigar Holdings to Snowsports Industries America.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, DLA Piper even <a href=\"http://lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/\">signed up to lobby</a> for several financial-industry firms of the type that the Facebook post seemingly criticizes Romney for representing. They include Discover Financial Services, Charles Schwab Corp. and the now-defunct Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second problem is broader. The Facebook post makes it sound like the groups listed for each candidate actually gave money to the campaign. But corporations are prohibited from making direct contributions to candidate committees such as Romney&#39;s and Obama&#39;s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOpenSecrets.org makes the following note on the charts and marks it in red, italic type for emphasis: &quot;The organizations themselves did not donate, rather the money came from the organizations&#39; PACs, their individual members or employees or owners, and those individuals&#39; immediate families.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what these top-contributors lists show is not that Google gave money to Obama, but that employees of Google gave money of their own volition, either directly or through a company-sponsored political action committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven though the post may have been several months old by the time we checked it, the list of each candidate&rsquo;s top contributors was pretty accurate, although it doesn&#39;t quite match the latest version from OpenSecrets. But the Facebook post doesn&rsquo;t accurately describe what the list means. First, it incorrectly labels one of Obama&rsquo;s donors. Second, the companies and colleges did not donate to Obama and Romney; their employees or related PACs did, which is an important detail. On balance, we rate the post Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-27T12:14:45.975768", "ruling_date": "2012-04-27T14:52:00", "ruling_headline": "Facebook post says Romney's top donors come from Wall Street, Obama's from tech and academia", "ruling_headline_slug": "facebook-post-says-romneys-top-donors-come", "ruling_link_text": "The donors on the list are pretty accurate, but they aren't described correctly", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tFacebook post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=158328720962265&amp;set=a.105167936278344.3931.104867519641719&amp;type=1&amp;theater\">Top 5 campaign contributors</a>,&quot; accessed April 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOpenSecrets.org, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=N00009638\">Barack Obama&rsquo;s top contributors</a>, accessed April 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOpenSecrets.org, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=N00000286\">Mitt Romney&rsquo;s top contributors</a>, accessed April 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDLA Piper <a href=\"http://www.dlapiper.com/\">homepage</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. House of Representatives Office of the Clerk, <a href=\"http://lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/\">main search page for lobbying disclosures</a>, accessed April 27, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 14, "current_job": "Social media posting", "false_count": 18, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 1486, "last_name": "Facebook posts", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "facebook-posts", "pants_count": 37, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Facebook_icon_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1486/", "total_count": 101, "true_count": 6, "website": "http://www.facebook.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Mitt Romney&rsquo;s top five donors are Wall Street firms, while Barack Obama&rsquo;s top five are technology companies and universities.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Facebook post", "statement_date": "2012-04-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 34, "current_job": "Former governor", "false_count": 32, "first_name": "Mitt", "half_true_count": 58, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 5, "last_name": "Romney", "mostly_true_count": 33, "name_slug": "mitt-romney", "pants_count": 19, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-mittromney.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/5/", "total_count": 221, "true_count": 30, "website": "http://www.mittromney.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
