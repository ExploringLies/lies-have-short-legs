Rick Perry, has never held a private-sector job,  the Wichita Falls Times Record News reported.</p>\r\n<p>Never is a long  time. Is White right?</p>\r\n<p>First, we checked on whether the newspaper  correctly quoted White. Why? The comment isn't in quotation marks in its  article, raising the possibility the reporter made an inference. However, Lynn Walker, the Wichita Falls newspaperman  who spoke with White on Tuesday, told us he jotted down &ldquo;Perry never  held a private-sector job&rdquo; because that is what White told him &ldquo;word for  word.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>When we called White's campaign about his comment, White  spokeswoman Katy Bacon said White realized afterward he should have  instead said something like Perry had &ldquo;barely&rdquo; or &ldquo;hardly&rdquo; any  private-sector experience. She said a clarification was sent to the  newspaper.</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, Perry has been a full-time state official for  nearly 20 years. Before succeeding George W. Bush as governor in late  2000, he was lieutenant governor in 1999-2000 after serving two  four-year terms as state agriculture commissioner.</p>\r\n<p>So how much  private-sector experience does the governor have?</p>\r\n<p>Perry  spokeswoman Allison Castle reminded us that Perry's background lies in  his family's farming and ranching business in Haskell County, where he  grew up.</p>\r\n<p>Born in March 1950, Perry attended Texas A&amp;M  University. After graduating in 1972, he was a pilot in the U.S. Air  Force until he was discharged in 1977, with the rank of captain,  according to his biographical entry in the Texas State Directory.</p>\r\n<p>In  his autobiographical 2008 book, \"On My Honor,\" Perry describes his  return: \"Dad still thought I was there to do chores. I reminded him that  I had just finished commanding a multi-million-dollar piece of  government equipment and a number of grown men. He reminded me that the  chores still needed tending to.\"</p>\r\n<p>In a profile published by the  Austin American-Statesman, Perry is quoted saying that in 1978 he was  within weeks of starting training as a Southwest Airlines pilot when a  heavy rain prompted him to knuckle down. &ldquo;I just made the decision that  this is where I need to be,&rdquo; Perry said.</p>\r\n<p>Perry subsequently ran  for the Texas House -- a position intended to be part time, paying less  than $10,000 a year -- and won the first of his three two-year terms in  1984.</p>\r\n<p>Two former Haskell residents who&rsquo;ve long known Perry said  he worked in various ways in the 13 years between returning from the Air  Force and being elected in 1990 to his first statewide office as  agriculture commissioner.</p>\r\n<p>Semi-retired pharmacist Doyle High, who  lives in Austin, said Perry farmed and ranched with his father and also  worked as a pilot for someone who lived in Abilene.</p>\r\n<p>Consultant  Don Comedy of Marble Falls, who said he lived near Perry at that time,  also recalled Perry farming and ranching. Comedy said Perry and his  father leased a ranch covering some 8,000 to 12,000 acres, making  provision for hundreds of cows.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That first winter,\" after Perry  left the Air Force, Comedy said, \"we had several, eight to 10 days in  row, the temperature never got above freezing. Rick was leaving the  house in the morning before daylight, breaking ice on ponds so those  cows could drink water... hauling hay, doctoring sick cows, riding  horseback, coming in at night after dark... He was joking that at least  in the Air Force, they had heaters in the airplane.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Comedy said  Perry also went into business with a partner buying and selling  airplanes; the partner has since died. Comedy said Perry also rented out  space in buildings that he owned in Haskell.</p>\r\n<p>Andrew Gannaway,  president of Haskell National Bank, said Perry served on the bank&rsquo;s  board of directors from 1983 through 1988, subsequently serving as an  advisory director from 1989 to 1996. &ldquo;He was involved in a family  farming and ranching operation,&rdquo; Gannaway said. &ldquo;They were looking for  local businessmen and folks who were a good representation of the  community to serve on the board.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Perry's pre-government  employment may not have been in typical 9-to-5 occupations, but it  certainly qualifies as a \"private-sector job.\"</p>\r\n<p>Bacon, White's  spokeswoman, said he was making the point that he has considerably more  private-sector experience &mdash; as a lawyer and businessman &mdash; than Perry  does.</p>\r\n<p>That's not entirely what White said in Wichita Falls. We  rate his statement as False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-04-23T19:13:54.787855", "ruling_date": "2010-04-25T20:17:13", "ruling_headline": "Democrat Bill White says Gov.
