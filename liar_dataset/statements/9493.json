That broke down to 433,251 acre-feet let go from the Highland Lakes plus 96,329 acre-feet of water used by farmers from the river alone, the report says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An acre-foot, 325,851 gallons, is <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/lifestyles/environment/with-recommendation-judge-strikes-win-for-austin-a/ndXwb/\"><u>roughly equal</u></a> to the water used by three average Austin households in a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the 529,580 acre-feet of water that went to farmers compares to Austin using 168,334 acre-feet of water that year, the report states, including 61,712 acre-feet diverted from the Colorado River at Lake Austin and 106,622 acre-feet obtained from the Highland Lakes under a city contract with the authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This result suggests the water released to farmers was equal to a little more than three times what Austin used that year. Also, Slusher pointed out that according to the authority, Austin used less water in 2012 (151,495 acre-feet) and even less again (142,027 acre-feet) in 2013, widening the 3-to-1 ratio for those years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to suss Meszaro&rsquo;s claim, Slusher wrote, lies in adding up the last three years&rsquo; worth of Austin&rsquo;s water use, which gets us 461,856 acre-feet, or 13 percent less than the 529,580 acre-feet released to farmers in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meszaros said billions of gallons of river water released to downstream rice farmers in 2011 equaled about three years worth of Austin&rsquo;s water use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equaled or exceeded is the long and short of it.
