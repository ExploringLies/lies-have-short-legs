We wanted to check that out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe asked Otto Schell, legislative director for the <a href=\"http://www.oregonpta.org/\">Oregon PTA</a>, where the ranking came from. He said a 2013 report compiled by the National Education Association, the country&rsquo;s largest teacher union, ranked Oregon third.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s a dubious honor to be in that top tier,&quot; Schell said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe looked it up and there was Oregon, ranked behind California and Utah.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.nea.org/home/44479.htm\">NEA looked at the ratio of students to teachers </a>to figure out the ranking. This isn&rsquo;t the same as class size, which is different from the student-teacher ratio and is harder to measure. The average class size is always bigger than the pupil-teacher ratio, mainly because some teachers have planning periods and others work with small groups of students who have special needs, forcing the typical teacher to take on larger classes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tA national headcount classroom to classroom would be a daunting data collection effort. Instead, researchers rely on staffing ratios to compare states since there&rsquo;s a direct relationship between the student-teacher ratio and class size. Because of that, the two are often bandied around interchangeably.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOregon&rsquo;s student-teacher ratio in the fall of 2011, according to the NEA, was 20.2.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tOK, so Oregon ranked third on the list according to data collected by the NEA. We wondered what other sources of data say about Oregon&rsquo;s student-teacher ratio.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.ode.state.or.us/data/annreportcard/rptcard2012.pdf\">state of Oregon calculates student-teacher ratios </a>a little differently, using an average of full-time-equivalent teaching positions and student enrollment across the school year. The state number is higher, with 21.3 students per teacher.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThat would still rank Oregon behind Utah and California in the NEA rankings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe wondered if the state calculation was consistently higher. Turns out it was, but not by much. Going back to the 2008-2009 school year, the statewide average student-teacher ratio was 19.1. The NEA pegged Oregon at 18.9.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe also checked in on the United States Department of Education&rsquo;s database of school statistics. The measure for the 2011-2012 school year isn&rsquo;t available until June, so we looked at past data from the feds to see how it measured up against the NEA&rsquo;s Oregon numbers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tHistorical federal data lined up closely -- but not exactly -- with the state numbers we found. Oregon fared poorly in the federal ranking. In the 2008-09 school year, the state had the fifth-largest student-teacher ratio. That ranking rose to third in 2009-10 and dropped back to fourth in the 2010-11 school year.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo overall, three data sets produced very similar results about Oregon&rsquo;s student-teacher ratios, all of which say the state has one of the highest student-teacher ratios in the United States.
