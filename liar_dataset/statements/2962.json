An Austin American-Statesman editorial columnist, Ken Herman, later noted that Alaska has about 700,000 people, while Austin has about 786,000.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBegala continued: &quot;Now, quick: Who&#39;s the mayor of Austin? Turns out it&#39;s Lee Leffingwell. And Lee Leffingwell&#39;s been the mayor of Austin for about as long as Sarah Palin was governor of Alaska, but nobody is saying that Lee Leffingwell ought to be president.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe&#39;re not getting into the population contrast or Leffingwell&#39;s designs on the White House. But has he been hizzoner about as long as Palin was governor?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a <a href=\"http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/council/mayor/default.htm\">city of Austin web page</a>, Leffingwell&#39;s term as mayor started June 22, 2009. So he&#39;s held that post for nearly 18 months of his three-year term. Palin was sworn into office as Alaska&#39;s governor Dec. 4, 2006, according to the <a href=\"http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/091108/sta_331076126.shtml\">Associated Press</a>. She resigned effective July 26, 2009, according to another <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/07/26/sarah-palin-steps-sean-parnell-sworn-governor-alaska/\">AP news article</a>, having served about 32 months of her four-year term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe asked Begala about his calculation. He replied by e-mail that while he checked the populations of Austin and Alaska, he also &quot;should have checked the mayor&#39;s duration in office versus Palin&#39;s. I stand corrected.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the spirit of his broadcasted Palin dig, Begala added: &quot;So in another year and a half let&#39;s run the mayor for prez.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo comment.
