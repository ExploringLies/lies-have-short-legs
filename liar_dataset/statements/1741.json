Arlen Specter, a leading Democrat on  his chamber's Judiciary Committee, has been sharing his views on the  upcoming debate.</p>\r\n<p>During an interview on MSNBC's <em>The Daily  Rundown</em>, Specter told hosts Chuck Todd and Savannah Guthrie that he  thinks the court has been avoiding tough cases, such as the  constitutionality of the terrorist surveillance program. Specter said  he's even considering conditioning his vote for the nominee based on  whether he or she will take up such cases.</p>\r\n<p>\"The Supreme Court has  a very light backlog,\" he said. \"They leave a lot of splits among the  circuits, a lot of uncertainty. And I think they ought to work a lot  harder. . . . Congress can tell them which cases they ought to hear. We  have that authority. And I think Congress ought to exercise it.\"</p>\r\n<p>The  last time we checked, there were strict barriers between the three  branches of government, so we were curious about Specter's comment.</p>\r\n<p>Specter's  comment is a bit cryptic; it reads as if he's saying that Congress can  tell the court that it must hear a <em>specific</em> case. His office did  not respond to our request for comment, but the experts we spoke with  said that he's referring to Article III of the Constitution, which gives  Congress the authority to establish appellate jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>\"In  all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have  appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions,  and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make,\" the Article  states.</p>\r\n<p>In plain English, all that means is that Congress can  tell the Court what genre of cases it must hear. For instance, it must  hear appeals on voting issues. Here's what section 5 the Voting Rights  Act of 1965 said about states that seek to establish voting  qualifications or prerequisites:</p>\r\n<p>\"Any action under  this section shall be heard and determined by a court of three judges  in accordance with the provisions of section 2284 of title 28 of the  United States Code and any appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court.\"</p>\r\n<p>So,  appeals on decisions made by the special three-judge court regarding  changes in voting qualifications must be heard by the Supreme Court.</p>\r\n<p>Appeals  to the campaign finance rules set out in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform  Act of 2002 -- commonly known as the McCain-Feingold Act named for the  two senators who wrote it -- face a similar trajectory: Complaints are  first heard by a three-judge court, and are ultimately decided by appeal  directly to the Supreme Court of the United States. The law also  requires the Supreme Court to hear these cases in an expedited fashion.</p>\r\n<p>In  fact, for much of the last century, many cases fell within the Supreme  Court's mandatory jurisdiction, according to the legal scholars we spoke  with. But in 1988, Congress passed a bill that abolished requirements  that the Supreme Court hear most appeals cases (although it did preserve  mandatory jurisdiction over some types of appeals cases, including  voting rights cases). The idea was to save the Court precious time that  it was otherwise wasting on appeals that had little significance.</p>\r\n<p>So,  is Specter correct?</p>\r\n<p>\"It is up to Congress to identify which  cases should go to the Court via appeal,\" Mark Tushnet, a professor at  Harvard Law School, wrote to us in an e-mail. \"So, basically, Senator  Specter's right.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Congress can't look around and  say, 'Here's one particular case you have to decide on the merits,'\"  Tushnet added. \"They do have to act in general terms.\"</p>\r\n<p>Specter  claimed that Congress can tell the Supreme Court which cases it must  hear. According to the Constitution, Congress has the authority to do  just that: it can write legislation that gives the court appellate  jurisdiction over certain cases, as it did when it passed the Voting  Rights Act. However, our experts said Congress cannot tell the Court  that is must hear <em>a </em>specific case. We find Specter's claim True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-04-28T22:55:30.109975", "ruling_date": "2010-04-28T22:52:31", "ruling_headline": "Specter says Congress can tell the Supreme Court what to consider", "ruling_headline_slug": "specter-says-congress-can-tell-supreme-court-wh", "ruling_link_text": "It's all part of the balance of powers", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>The Daily Rundown</em>, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/36687523#36687523\" target=\"_blank\">interview  with Arlen Specter</a>, April 21, 2010, episode<br /><br />The White House,  <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/our-government/judicial-branch\" target=\"_blank\">The  Judicial Branch</a>, accessed April 21, 2010<br /><br />The U.S.  Constitution, <a href=\"http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/article03/\" target=\"_blank\">Article  III</a>, accessed April 21, 2010<br /><br /><a href=\"http://cndls.georgetown.edu/applications/postertool/index.cfm?fuseaction=poster.display&amp;posterID=1714\" target=\"_blank\">Congress'  Power to Set the Supreme Court's Jurisdiction: Trends, Dangers, and  Recent Developments</a>, Robert Heberle, accessed April 21, 2010<br /><br />Department  of Justice, <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/crt/voting/sec_5/about.php\" target=\"_blank\">About  Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act</a>, accessed April 23, 2010</p>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>National  Archives, <a href=\"http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=100&amp;page=transcript\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Voting Rights Act of 1965\">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a>,  accessed April 29, 2010</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The Government Printing  Office, <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ155/html/PLAW-107publ155.htm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Public Law 107 - 155 - Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act  of 2002\">Public Law 107 - 155 - Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002</a>,  accessed April 29, 2010</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>The <em>New York Times</em>,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/09/us/supreme-court-is-expected-to-gain-wide-freedom-in-selecting-cases.html?pagewanted=1\" target=\"_blank\">The  Court is Expected to Gain Wide Freedom in Selecting Cases</a>, by  Stuart Taylor Jr., June 9, 1988. <br /><br />The Federal Judicial Center, <a href=\"http://www.fjc.gov/history/courts_supreme.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Supreme Court  of the United States and the Federal Judiciary</a>, accessed April, 23,  2010<br /><br />Phone Interview, Michael Bailey, professor, Georgetown  Public Policy Institute, April 23, 2010<br /><br />E-mail Interview, David  Garrow, professor and senior fellow, University of Cambridge, April 23,  2010<br /><br />Phone Interview, Lucas A. \"Scot\" Powe, professor, The  University of Texas at Austin, April 23, 2010<br /><br />E-mail Interview,  Erwin Chemerinsky, Dean of the University of California, Irvine School  of Law, April 23, 2010<br /><br />E-mail Interview, Mark Tushnet, professor,  Harvard Law School, April 23, 2010<br /><br />Phone Interview, Tom  Goldstein, partner with Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld, and founder  of SCOTUSblog, April 23, 2010</div>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Senator", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Arlen", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Pennsylvania", "id": 148, "last_name": "Specter", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "arlen-specter", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/Specter.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/148/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://specter.senate.gov/public/"}, "statement": "<p>&nbsp;\"Congress can tell [the Supreme Court] which cases they ought to hear.
