Ted Strickland tied Sen. Rob Portman to the notorious former president of Haiti, Jean-Claude &quot;Baby Doc&quot; Duvalier, during the final Ohio Senate debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There&#39;s only one of the two of us standing before this audience that&#39;s ever been a registered lobbyist, and that&#39;s you, senator,&quot; Strickland said. &quot;Your first job as a lobbyist was with the Chinese-based firm. You were a registered foreign agent, and your client was Haiti, at a time when the Baby Doc, Duvalier, who was a despot, was killing people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland&rsquo;s charge is a mixed bag of accuracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After losing his re-election bid to Republican Gov. John Kasich, Strickland <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2016/oct/20/rob-portman/portman-strickland-duel-over-whos-richer/\">oversaw</a> the lobbying and activism arm of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, but <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/17/a-look-at-personal-finances-of-ohio-candidates-for/\">he was not a lobbyist himself</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that Portman, however, was a registered foreign agent, a title that can involve lobbying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As PolitiFact Ohio has previously <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2016/aug/23/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democrats-ad-ties-sen-rob-portman-haitian-dic/\">reported</a>, Portman started working with the law firm Patton, Boggs &amp; Blow after graduating from University of Michigan&#39;s law school in 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Strickland campaign sent us a Buzzfeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/rob-portman-was-registered-foreign-agent-for-haiti?utm_term=.af92YJ8Vo#.vevJ1nbGz\">article</a> showing Portman&rsquo;s 1985 foreign agent registration form. He was listed as a foreign agent on behalf of the Republic of Haiti, which was ruled by Duvalier at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duvalier, who inherited the &quot;president for life&quot; post from his father, &quot;Papa Doc,&quot; headed what human rights workers called one of the most oppressive governments in the Western Hemisphere, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/world/americas/jean-claude-duvalier-haitis-baby-doc-dies-at-63.html?_r=0\">according to the <em>New York Times.</em></a> His regime, known for the murder and torture of of tens of thousands, was toppled in 1986. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not entirely fair to imply that Portman was Duvalier&rsquo;s lackey. He never lobbied on behalf of Haiti or any other foreign government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2005, Portman was named by President George W. Bush as his U.S. Trade Representative, a position that can&rsquo;t be held by anyone who&rsquo;s ever lobbied for foreign governments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being tapped for the position prompted an affidavit from Stuart Pape, a former managing partner of Portman&#39;s law firm dated April 12, 2005. Pape said Portman filed the foreign agent registration form because he was working for the Hong Kong-based Duty Free Shoppers, Ltd., the &quot;Chinese-based firm&quot; Strickland referred to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Pape said he reviewed the records and confirmed that Portman did no work for Haiti or any foreign government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Portman&rsquo;s campaign website, the Haiti registration is <a href=\"https://www.robportman.com/desperate_strickland_plans_false_attacks\">explained</a> as &quot;standard procedure&quot; at the lobbying firm, and required of all of its attorneys. The firm, the record shows, did travel to Haiti to meet with Baby Doc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland said of Portman, &quot;You were a registered foreign agent, and your client was Haiti, at a time when the Baby Doc, Duvalier, who was a despot, was killing people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portman was&nbsp;a registered foreign agent who worked on behalf of a company based in Hong Kong. His firm&rsquo;s clients included &quot;Baby Doc&quot; Duvalier&rsquo;s government. But Portman himself did no work for the Haitian regime, according to a sworn statement by the firm&rsquo;s managing partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Strickland&#39;s statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Correction: </strong>The original&nbsp;version of this fact-check incorrectly called Rob Portman a registered lobbyist. He was a registered foreign agent, a classification that included lobbying under the law at that time.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-20T20:27:59.248548", "ruling_date": "2016-10-20T20:29:02", "ruling_headline": "Ted Strickland revives 'Baby Doc' lobbyist attack against Rob Portman in Cleveland debate", "ruling_headline_slug": "ted-strickland-revives-baby-doc-attack-against-por", "ruling_link_text": "His firm, not him, represented Baby Doc", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with David Bergstein, spokesman for Ted Strickland, Oct. 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Michawn Rich, spokeswoman for Rob Portman, Oct. 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2016/aug/23/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democrats-ad-ties-sen-rob-portman-haitian-dic/\">Ohio Democrats&#39; ad ties Sen.
