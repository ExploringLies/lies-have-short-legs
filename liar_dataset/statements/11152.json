Anthony List, a political action committee that opposes abortion and supports anti-abortion candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Susan B. Anthony List&rsquo;s numbers derive from Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/annual_report_final_proof_12.16.14_/0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2013-14 annual report</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first caveat to know&nbsp;is that Planned Parenthood does not have a category for &quot;pregnancy services.&quot;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s a category the Susan B. Anthony List created, and the background reasoning has been the same as similarly <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2015/mar/02/thomas-tobin/ri-bishop-thomas-tobin-says-abortions-make-94-plan/\">misleading&nbsp;claims</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/apr/21/jean-schmidt/rep-jean-schmidt-says-32-every-33-pregnant-women-w/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>over the years</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the <a href=\"http://www.sba-list.org/sites/default/files/content/shared/12.31.14fact_sheet_pp_2013_2014_annual_report.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>fact sheet</u></a>, &quot;pregnancy services&quot; are broken down into three categories: abortions, prenatal care and adoption referrals. Susan B. Anthony List spokeswoman Mallory Quigley said these are the three ways a woman can respond to a pregnancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that in mind, here&rsquo;s the section from Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s annual report that contains those categories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"2015-08-04 12_09_39-Greenshot.png\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/c_zU5iPavLfB0F_gX5R5BoFLKs5YQ0-mLlGyJ8A-5MLxeHNTS-7IpXYHFtR1bmILwFJFbZtkR5Vr6ox_m0Csm7M2dgsMhG4P1XVUfz2Ilpd4-twzWIFlWwGcJbT30FcLihu7YG4\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:857px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:407px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To arrive at the Susan B. Anthony List figure, you have to tease out specific elements&nbsp;from the chart:&nbsp;prenatal services (18,684), adoption referrals (1,880) and abortions (327,653).&nbsp;Abortions account for 94 percent of the sum of these subcategories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For several&nbsp;reasons, that&rsquo;s a misleading way to analyze the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Referrals for prenatal care not in equation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all of Planned Parenthood approximately 700&nbsp;clinics offer prenatal services because prenatal care is not Planned Parenthood&#39;s focus.&nbsp;As a result,&nbsp;many pregnant women are referred to outside obstetricians or other health providers for prenatal care.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How many? It&#39;s impossible to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planned Parenthood does not record how many&nbsp;pregnant patients are referred to outside health care providers,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>said Elizabeth Clark, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If referrals were included, the 95 percent figure would likely change, though we can&#39;t say by&nbsp;how much &mdash; and neither can Smith nor the Susan B. Anthony List.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The rest of the story</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planned Parenthood&nbsp;does not specifically&nbsp;track of the number of pregnant women who come into clinics for&nbsp;other reasons. And many of Planned Parenthood&#39;s services are not related to prenatal care, abortion or adoption.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testing and treatment for sexually transmitted disease and&nbsp;infection, both for men and women, accounts for the largest share of services provided by Planned Parenthood at&nbsp;more than 4.47 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contraception, which includes birth control, emergency contraception&nbsp;kits, and&nbsp;sterilization and vasectomy procedures, accounts for more than 3.58 million&nbsp;services.&nbsp;Different types of cancer screening and prevention, including breast exams,&nbsp;account for 935,573 services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As show on the chart above, there were also&nbsp;more than 1.1 million pregnancy tests, 47,2000 urinary tract infection treatments,&nbsp;or 65,500 &quot;family practice services.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the course of 2013-14, Planned Parenthood performed more than 10.5 million services. Sometimes patients are double-counted because they receive multiple services. Put another way. Planned Parenthood clinics saw 2.7 million individual patients that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of all services, abortions&nbsp;account for 3 percent of services performed, said Erica Sackin, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, pointing to <a href=\"http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/annual_report_final_proof_12.16.14_/0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>page 18 of the report</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But looking at the share of abortions per patient (and&nbsp;assuming one procedure per patient), the figure rises to&nbsp;12 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2011/apr/21/jean-schmidt/rep-jean-schmidt-says-32-every-33-pregnant-women-w/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Some critics</u></a> have taken issue with Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s measurement of &quot;services.&quot; Performing an abortion is more involved than administering pregnancy tests or giving someone a contraception kit, for example. The share of abortions might be different if cost or hours of services were used. (However, that information is not in the 2013-14 annual report.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith said, &quot;Almost 95 percent of all (Planned Parenthood&#39;s) pregnancy services were abortions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An anti-abortion group puts&nbsp;the figure at 94 percent using a cherry-picked method that ignores the majority of Planned Parenthood&#39;s services, which aim to prevent pregnancies. The group describes&nbsp;&quot;pregnancy services&quot; as counting what Planned Parenthood does for women once they are already pregnant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Planned Parenthood does not fully track this number, making the claim a leap of logic based on insufficient information.&nbsp;What&#39;s most noticeably missing among the number of Planned Parenthood&nbsp;services used by pregnant women are the number of pregnancy referrals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planned Parenthood says it doesn&#39;t keep records of how many pregnant women are referred to outside healthcare providers.&nbsp;Without that information, we don&#39;t know an accurate&nbsp;percentage of &quot;pregnancy services&quot; that were abortions.&nbsp;Neither, however, does Smith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong>&nbsp;After this fact-check published, an official with Planned Parenthood contacted us and said that she was not authorized to speak on&nbsp;the&nbsp;record.
