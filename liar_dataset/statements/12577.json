The premise: what America&rsquo;s economy would look like with Trump in charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Over the years, he&rsquo;s said all kinds of things about women in the workforce,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;He once called pregnant employees -- and I quote -- &lsquo;an inconvenience.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton went on to say that even she was incredulous that Trump made remarks like the &quot;inconvenience&quot; statement, despite assurances from her researchers and speechwriters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We searched for the clip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s comment stems from a <em>Dateline NBC</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6qkJhbA7p0\">interview </a>of Trump from 2004. The segment, &quot;Blonde Ambition,&quot; was about Carolyn Kepcher, Trump&rsquo;s <em>Apprentice </em>sidekick and executive vice president of Trump&rsquo;s golf properties. Kepcher had just released <em>Carolyn 101</em>, a memoir of her business experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kepcher describes herself as a straight-shooter, but as her <em>Dateline</em> interviewer points out, that seems to conflict with an anecdote in the book in which Kepcher recounts waiting six months before telling Trump that she was pregnant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You were worried that he might feel inconvenienced?&quot; the reporter asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Maybe, in my mind, he might think perhaps that this might be a setback,&quot; Kepcher answered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the piece turned to Trump, he answered a question that the viewers don&rsquo;t get to hear, due to editing. &quot;Well you know, pregnancy is never, um -- it&rsquo;s a wonderful thing for the woman, it&rsquo;s a wonderful thing for the husband, it&rsquo;s certainly an inconvenience for a business. And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the viewers don&rsquo;t hear the question Trump is responding to, and the only other person to use the word &quot;inconvenience&quot; was the <em>Dateline </em>reporter, it&rsquo;s possible that the term may have been introduced as part of the reporter&rsquo;s question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies have shown that the costs of accommodating pregnant employees is minimal. The National Women&rsquo;s Law Center published a<a href=\"http://www.nwlc.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pregnant_workers_business_case_12.04.12.pdf\"> fact sheet</a> in 2012 that pointed out that the accommodations employers already provide for disabled employees are much the same as what pregnant women require, only temporarily. And the positive gains -- better recruitment and retention of workers, boosts in productivity, reductions in absenteeism, better workplace safety -- far outweigh any costs, according to the fact sheet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s views on pregnancy didn&rsquo;t sway Kepcher&rsquo;s admiration for her former boss. &quot;If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve learned from Donald, it&rsquo;s to make a decision, make it fast, and stick with it,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump certainly didn&rsquo;t view his daughter Ivanka&rsquo;s pregnancy as an inconvenience when she stood beside him, well into her third trimester, stumping in New Hampshire and South Carolina. Trump told crowds in both states that he&rsquo;d love for his daughter to have her baby there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You know, she had a baby like five days ago,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/05/27/donald_trump_called_pregnancy_an_inconvenience_for_business_owners.html\">Trump said of Ivanka at a March rally in New York</a>, about 10 days after Ivanka gave birth. &quot;She did a good job. So I should not say Ivanka, you&#39;re fired, right? I promise.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We searched but were unable to find any additional comments made by Trump about women employees becoming pregnant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said that Trump called pregnancy &quot;an inconvenience&quot; for business owners. Trump indeed used that word in a 2004 interview with NBC&rsquo;s Dateline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s claim is accurate.
