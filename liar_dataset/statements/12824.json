Early in her speech, she praised Sanders for putting economic and social justice issues &quot;front and center, where they belong.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton gave Sanders a nod again when she laid out her plans to invest in the nation&rsquo;s bridges and highways, cut the cost of college tuition and make it easier for small businesses to get loans. She promised it all would be paid for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And here&#39;s how: Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;Not because we resent success. Because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that&#39;s where the money is.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s claim about who&rsquo;s been getting most of the gains comes -- almost -- straight from Sanders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the opening night of the convention, he offered a slightly toned down version saying &quot;the top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/26/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-outdated-income-inequality-statisti/\">when we looked into that</a>, we found that the numbers are out of date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University of California Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez is the go-to source on income inequality. According to Saez&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2015.pdf\">latest data</a>, the top 1 percent took in 52 percent of all income in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As recently as 2012, the fraction was close to 90 percent, but here&rsquo;s how things have changed since then:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><script id=\"infogram_0_0787a1b0-7797-4d32-962d-f2bbbe0a516f\" title=\"Top 1% income\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?aJh\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we reached out to the Clinton campaign, they cited a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/19/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-99-percent-new-income-going-to/\">fact-check we wrote</a> in 2015. But as we&rsquo;ve noted, the trend has changed. Inequality still exists, but not at the level the country was seeing before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Saez explained in his most recent report, &quot;In 2014 and especially in 2015, the incomes of bottom 99 percent families have finally started recovering in earnest from the losses of the Great Recession.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said that &quot;more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent.&quot; That statistic was approximately correct a few years ago, but today, one of the nation&rsquo;s leading authorities on income distribution says a more accurate figure is that 52 percent of all income flows to the top 1 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That still reveals a great deal of inequality, but not at the scale Clinton said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4ce46feb-1282-4db0-b9d3-cfbea21425d0\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4ce46feb-1282-4db0-b9d3-cfbea21425d0</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-29T01:12:03.430194", "ruling_date": "2016-07-29T01:11:35", "ruling_headline": "Clinton tips hat to Bernie Sanders, but uses out of date statistic", "ruling_headline_slug": "clinton-tips-hat-bernie-sanders-uses-out-date-stat", "ruling_link_text": "A Half True hat-tip to Bernie", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton speech, July 28, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/26/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-outdated-income-inequality-statisti/\">Bernie Sanders&#39; outdated income inequality statistic</a>, July 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emmanuel Saez, &quot;<a href=\"http://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2015.pdf\">Striking it Richer: The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States (Updated with 2015 preliminary estimates)</a>,&quot; June 30, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;More than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech at the Democratic National Convention", "statement_date": "2016-07-29", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 29, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/29/", "subject": "Poverty", "subject_slug": "poverty", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Clinton tips hat to Sanders, but uses out of date statistic"}
