And it didn't create a single job.\"<br /><br />Many  stimulus projects are simply wasteful, she said.<br /><br />\"And in the case of  those signs,\" she said, \"kind of ridiculous.\"<br /><br />The state in question here  is clearly Ohio, which has been the subject of recent press reports on the subject. And the issue is over road signs along stimulus-funded highway projects  that state: \"Putting America to Work. Project Funded by the American Recovery  and Reinvestment Act.\"<br /><br />The stimulus' <a href=\"http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/economicrecovery/guidance.htm\" target=\"_blank\">implementation  guidelines</a> from the Federal Highway Administration \"strongly encourages\"  (but does not require) the signs \"to make it easier for Americans to see which  projects are funded by the ARRA.\" The guidelines also provide <a href=\"http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/economicrecovery/arrasigndetail.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">precise  details</a> on the form and content of the sign and recovery logo. As far  back as July, a number of Republican legislators, and some Democrats, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/17/robert-bennett/bennett-says-stimulus-spending-too-much-road-signs/\" target=\"_blank\">criticized  the signs as wasteful</a>. Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin, mocking the  red, blue and green logo of the stimulus, went so far as to label the signs  &ldquo;stimulus hype propaganda sporting the mark of the porkulus beast.\" <br /><br />As a  result of the public pressure, a number of states balked at the federal  recommendation to erect stimulus signs. <br /><br />Ohio was not one of  them.<br /><br />The signs became something of a pet peeve of Republican Ohio state  Sen. Tim Grendell, who drove daily past stimulus signs on both sides of a  highway resurfacing project near his home. Grendell's complaints were <a href=\"http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/09/ohio_could_spend_1_million_on.html\" target=\"_blank\">aired  in the <em>Cleveland Plain Dealer</em></a> on Sept. 9, 2009, along with the paper's  estimate that the signs could cost up to $1 million in Ohio. <br /><br />But a more recent Jan. 26, 2010, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/01/25/kaye.signs/index.html?hpt=C1\" target=\"_blank\">report on  CNN</a> may also have caught Palin's attention. CNN also cited the $1 million price tag  and attributed the figure to Grendell.<br /><br />So we called Grendell.  <br /><br />He called the signs \"self-congratulatory spin for the federal  government and the Obama administration\" and said the money could be better  spent on many other worthy highway projects in Ohio. \"It's a total waste of  public dollars,\" he said.<br /><br />As for the $1 million figure, Grendell said he  got that estimate from an Ohio Department of Transportation official when he  called to complain about the signs.<br /><br />Since then, Grendell said he spoke to  a company that rents some of the signs, and that they go for as much as $3,000  apiece. And with one on each side of a road project, that can run $6,000 per  project.<br /><br />Scott Varner, a spokesman with the Ohio Department of  Transportation, called the $1 million figure \"inaccurate,\" although he said the  state has no way of knowing the precise figure. <br /><br />The cost is rolled into  the expense of all the construction signs in a construction zone, he  said.<br /><br />The $1 million estimate, he said, is based on a \"high-end\" estimate  of the cost of a sign ($2,000 to $3,000 apiece), multiplied by the number of  projects. The cost of signs varies from project to project, he said, but the  ODOT estimated the cost of a large sign at about $1,000 to $1,300 per sign (with  the bulk of the cost in labor for installation and removal). <br /><br />In July,  the Associated Press reported that Michigan estimated a sign costs $400 to $500.  Illinois officials suggested $300 for the sign and an additional $700 when labor  is included, while Colorado officials said materials plus labor would run  between $750 and $1,200 per sign.<br /><br />The $1 million estimate in Ohio also  assumes two signs per project, Varner said, and the reality is that many  projects only got one sign; and many didn't get one at all. The estimate is also  based on the cost of a large sign for interstate projects. Smaller, less  expensive signs are used for city projects, he said.<br /><br />\"That $1 million  figure is at best on the high end,\" Varner said. \"It's not a true number.\" It is  more likely \"significantly under that.\"<br /><br />The complaints by Grendell, and  more recently Palin, also ignore the value of the signs, Varner said. Ohio  placed a high priority on transparency and accountability with regard to  stimulus projects, he said.<br /><br />\"What better way to let people know where the  stimulus dollars are being spent,\" he said.<br /><br />CNN polled other states and found at least 16 that are  skipping the signs and putting the money toward road projects instead.<br /><br />One of the states that has opted against the signs is Vermont. In  a <a href=\"http://blog.tomevslin.com/2009/08/where-are-the-signs.html\" target=\"_blank\">blog  posting</a>, the state's chief recovery officer, Tom Evslin, said, \"Here in  Vermont we decided that we'd rather spend the stimulus highway dollars on roads  than signs.\" All of the state's stimulus projects are listed on a state Web  site, he said. \"The Web is cheaper than signs.\"<br /><br />We think it's accurate  for Palin to describe the signs as advertisements for spending on stimulus  projects. That's exactly the point of them. We'll leave it up to legislators and  the American public to decide whether that's an appropriate use of stimulus  funds. But we can say the $1 million figure for signs in Ohio is suspect and  appears to be a back-of-the-envelope estimate, rather than a hard fact. Ohio  transportation officials said the total for signs is likely significantly lower  than that. But neither Palin nor ODOT (nor anyone else for that matter) can cite  an exact figure. And so we rate Palin's claim Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-02-08T18:38:29.281528", "ruling_date": "2010-02-08T19:48:12", "ruling_headline": "Palin claims a state paid $1 million to advertise that they were spending stimulus money", "ruling_headline_slug": "palin-claims-state-paid-1-million-advertise-they-w", "ruling_link_text": "Signs advertising stimulus, yes; $1 million, probably not", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WCPURhyUg\" target=\"_blank\">Video: Sarah Palin's Keynote Speech at the Tea Party convention</a> (about the 3 minute mark), Feb. 6, 2010</p>\r\n<p>CNN, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/01/25/kaye.signs/index.html?hpt=C1\" target=\"_blank\">\"Signs of waste? $1 million used to tout stimulus funds at work in Ohio,\"</a> by Randi Kaye, Jan. 26, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Cleveland Plain Dealer, <a href=\"http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/09/ohio_could_spend_1_million_on.html\" target=\"_blank\">\"Ohio could spend $1 million on signs marking stimulus-funded roadwork,\" </a>by Melodie Smith, Sept. 9, 2009</p>\r\n<p>Fractals of Chage, blog of Tom Evslin, Vermont's Chief Recovery Officer, <a href=\"http://blog.tomevslin.com/about.html\" target=\"_blank\">\"Where are the Signs?\"</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h1enr.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a></p>\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration Web site, <a href=\"http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/economicrecovery/guidance.htm\" target=\"_blank\">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Implementing Guidance</a>, Updated April 1, 2009</p>\r\n<p>PolitiFact.com. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/17/robert-bennett/bennett-says-stimulus-spending-too-much-road-signs/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Bennett says stimulus is spending too much on road signs promoting stimulus,\"</a> by Louis Jacobson, July 17, 2009</p>\r\n<p>Interview with Scott Varner, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Transportation, Feb. 8, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Interview with Ohio State Sen.
