So your PolitiFact Georgia scribe ordered a pint &ndash; even Beerack, er, Barack Obama knows the value of a good beer summit &ndash; and settled in to research whether the state&rsquo;s brewpubs can&rsquo;t sell their products to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bitter brew</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia&rsquo;s history of direct beer sales to consumers is a bitter one. Craft brewers have sought for at least a decade to change the state law that keeps them from making money from those who want to quaff their wares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this year&rsquo;s legislative session, Senate Bill 63 originally would have given breweries and brewpubs their wish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the <a href=\"http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/20152016/154042.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>final version</u> </a>instead gave craft brewers the ability only to sell tours and give away their product &ndash; a backdoor way to sell limited amounts of beer to go - and stripped out brewpubs&rsquo; ability to do the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/georgia-brewers-hopping-mad-after-state-changes-ne/nnrck/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Controversy is brewing</u></a> over that change, now that the state Department of Revenue has issued a bulletin forbidding brewers from charging different prices for the tours based on the value of the beers offered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And brewpubs? <a href=\"http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/20152016/154042.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The law</u> </a>makes it clear they must sell only on site or to wholesale dealers &ndash; the middleman that<strong> </strong>direct sales would avoid<strong>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have had so many people come in, locals, students, parents and they love our beer and want to take some home with them,&quot; said Moran, who co-owns the Slice and Pint and two locations of the 5 Seasons brewpub. &quot;But the state legislature said those people can&rsquo;t buy beer where they want to. It&rsquo;s hard to take.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also hard to pin down. Nancy Palmer, executive director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild, agreed the hard line in SB 63 says brewpubs cannot sell their product to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But hypothetically, she said, brewpubs could sell a growler of beer that they did not produce on site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s because the state license for alcohol sales applies to bars, package stores and brewpubs alike and allows for sales both on and off premise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As far as the state is concerned, you could walk around Kroger drinking beer,&quot; Palmer said. &quot;Of course, Kroger doesn&rsquo;t allow that. And local governments are the ones who decide if they will allow on- or off-site sales.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decatur, for instance, allows people to buy growlers to go from growler shops &ndash; and also sample in the store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Slice &amp; Pint sits outside the city limits and wouldn&rsquo;t qualify for that perk because it is both a retail operation, like a growler shop, and a manufacturer, by making beer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moran&rsquo;s operation is also unique in that he rejects selling to a wholesaler. The state has just 12 other brewpubs, Palmer said, and all sell to that middleman, who can then make it available to go at package stores and the like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rules on the Department of Revenue website confirm use of wholesalers, as does the new legislation. A spokesman for the department declined to comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A brewpub owner in DeKalb County has created a series of beers designed to call attention to what his says is the state&rsquo;s interference between his business and consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IPA in question effectively claims that brewpubs<strong> </strong>can&rsquo;t sell their products to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new state law is clear that neither brewpubs nor breweries can make those sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The brewpub does have the option to sell to wholesalers, who can then make the suds available to consumers. But that is not the same thing as getting a growler to go with your pizza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-22T15:37:04.759313", "ruling_date": "2015-10-23T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Brewpub growling about state of craft beer", "ruling_headline_slug": "brewpub-growling-about-state-craft-beer-sales", "ruling_link_text": "No suds to go", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Slice &amp; Pint <a href=\"http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/22/02/14/SliceAndPintBeers-yellow.gif\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>menu</u></a>, Sept. 24, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Atlanta Journal Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/georgia-brewers-hopping-mad-after-state-changes-ne/nnrck/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Georgia brewers hopping mad after state changes new tour rules,</u></a>&quot; Sept. 30, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Georgia, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2015/mar/11/georgia-craft-brewers-guild/advocate-craft-beer-brewers-correct-claim/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Advocate for craft beer brewers correct on claim,</u></a>&quot; March 9, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia General Assembly, <a href=\"http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/20152016/154042.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Senate Bill 63</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Crawford Moran, brew master and co-owner, Slice &amp; Pint, Oct. 19, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Nancy Palmer, executive director, Georgia Craft Brewers Guild, Oct. 20, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, William Gaston, spokesman, Georgia Department of Revenue, Oct. 20 and 21, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3312, "last_name": "Slice & Pint brewpub", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "slice-pint-brewpub", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/PolitiFact_silhouette_39.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3312/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Brewpubs can&#39;t sell growlers of their beer to customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "the fall menu", "statement_date": "2015-09-24", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 186, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/186/", "subject": "Alcohol", "subject_slug": "Alcohol", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 109, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/109/", "subject": "Regulation", "subject_slug": "market-regulation", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 147, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/147/", "subject": "States", "subject_slug": "states", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
