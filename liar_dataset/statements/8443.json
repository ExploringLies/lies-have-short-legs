Over time, nearly every state jumped aboard. Not much controversy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But more recently, Common Core has come <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/oct/22/marco-rubio/common-core-obama-administration-national-school-b/\"><u>under attack</u></a> from conservatives around the country. U.S. Senate Republicans, for example, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/04/19/common-core-standards-attacked-by-republicans/\"><u>tried in April 2013</u></a> to kill federal funding for the program, calling it an interference with local control of public schools. In Wisconsin, GOP state lawmakers set <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/pages/comm-info.aspx?c=1183&amp;md=1\"><u>hearings</u></a> to review the standards; the next is Oct. 30, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the first hearing, on Oct. 3, 2013, state schools superintendent <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/tony-evers/\"><u>Tony Evers</u></a> -- the official who decided Wisconsin would adopt Common Core -- <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/education/wisconsin-hearing-repeats-debate-over-common-core-school-standards-b99112191z1-226375421.html?ipad=y#ixzz2grDeGFsn\"><u>told a reporter</u></a> that the pushback in Madison and elsewhere &quot;is all about what&#39;s going on in Washington. It&#39;s all about controlling the message and the next (presidential) election.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same day, state Rep. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/sondy-pope/\"><u>Sondy Pope</u></a> (D-Cross Plains) took a break from the hearing to defend Common Core on &quot;The Devil&#39;s Advocates&quot; talk show on WXXM-FM (92.1) in Madison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked whether Common Core means schools are forced to teach children based on &quot;federalized standards,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.themic921.com/media/podcast-the-devils-advocates-devilsadvocate/the-devils-advocates-10313-23795528/\"><u>Pope said</u></a>, &quot;absolutely not.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is not from the federal government. This is not &lsquo;ObamaCore.,&rsquo;&quot; she said. &quot;This came straight from the (National) Governors Association, of which (Gov. Scott Walker) is a member, and the state school chiefs -- the superintendents -- association, absolutely separate from anything that the federal government was doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They do not have their fingerprints on this thing at all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Pope right that Common Core didn&rsquo;t come from the federal government and that federal officials don&rsquo;t have their fingerprints on it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Common Core and its origins</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adopted by <a href=\"http://www.corestandards.org/in-the-states\"><u>45 states</u></a>, the <a href=\"http://www.corestandards.org/\"><u>Common Core State Standards</u></a> came out of years of discussion between private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Wisconsin, the standards will be aligned with a new standardized test that will roll out in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common Core&rsquo;s website <a href=\"http://www.corestandards.org/resources/frequently-asked-questions\"><u>explicitly states</u></a> that the federal government was not involved in developing the standards. And there is other evidence to support that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As PolitiFact Florida has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/aug/30/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-obama-wants-nationalize-curricu/\"><u>noted</u></a>, the <a href=\"http://www.ccsso.org/resources/programs/implementing_the_common_core_standards_(iccs).html\"><u>Council of Chief State School Officers</u></a> -- a national organization of public officials who head state education departments -- discussed developing common standards during its annual policy forum in 2007, a year before Barack Obama won the presidency. In 2009, the council and the <a href=\"http://www.nga.org/cms/home.html\"><u>National Governors Association</u></a> agreed to create the Common Core State Standards, developed them with the help of teachers, parents, and experts, and unveiled them in 2010. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Pope is accurate on the first part of her claim, that Common Core did not come from the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Federal involvement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida also addressed the second part of Pope&rsquo;s claim -- that federal officials &quot;do not have their fingerprints&quot; on Common Core. Our colleagues found that, although Common Core is voluntary for states to adopt, the federal government has had a role in encouraging them to adopt the standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get grants from <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/k-12/race-to-the-top\"><u>Race to the Top</u></a> -- Obama&rsquo;s signature education program -- or waivers from the mandates of <a href=\"http://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/no-child-left-behind/\"><u>No Child Left Behind</u></a> -- an education reform law adopted under President George W. Bush -- states have to prove they have standards to prepare students for college and work. They don&rsquo;t have to adopt the Common Core Standards, but that works as one way to qualify for grants or waivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a rush by states to adopt Common Core by August 2010 because establishing standards <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/21/education/21standards.html?_r=0\"><u>won them points</u></a> in the competition for a share of the billions in Race to the Top grants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom McCarthy, a spokesman for Pope, acknowledged &quot;there really wasn&rsquo;t a credible alternative to Common Core&quot; at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the federal government didn&rsquo;t force Common Core on the states, but it did create incentives for states to adopt the standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pope said: Common Core &quot;is not from the federal government,&quot; they &quot;do not have their fingerprints on this thing at all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal officials did not initiate the state standards for public schools or force them on the states. But they have given states financial incentives to adopt the standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, we give Pope a Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>If you would like to comment on this item, you can do so on the Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-testing-sondy-pope-claim-on-common-core-lack-of-federal-involvement-b99126947z1-228997361.html?page=1\">web page</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-10-22T17:58:52.001361", "ruling_date": "2013-10-24T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "How much is the federal government involved in the Common Core school standards?", "ruling_headline_slug": "how-much-federal-government-involved-common-core-s", "ruling_link_text": "Not a federal initiative, but some federal incentives", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WXXM-FM, &nbsp;&quot;The Devil&#39;s Advocates&quot; show <a href=\"http://www.themic921.com/media/podcast-the-devils-advocates-devilsadvocate/the-devils-advocates-10313-23795528/\"><u>interview</u></a> (quote at 5:30) of state Rep.
