As far as Mitt is concerned, it goes farther than current law, and therefore it's unnecessary.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Yet in 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples could be married in the state, Romney urged the legislature to adopt a constitutional amendment banning the practice. He has since supported a similar amendment to the U.S. Constitution, despite the fact that the congressionally proposed constitutional amendment includes language similar to the 2002 Massachusetts ballot proposal that he opposed.\n</p>\n<p>\n And so we give Romney a Half-True. He is correct that he has been consistent in his opposition to same-sex marriage, but has changed his position as to the scope of an amendment that he would support.\n</p>\n<p>\n &nbsp;\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:35.914053", "ruling_date": "2007-10-05T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Consistent on gay marriage, not on amendment", "ruling_headline_slug": "consistent-on-gay-marriage-not-on-amendment", "ruling_link_text": "Consistent on gay marriage, not on amendment", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n New York Times,\n <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/08/us/politics/08romney.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Romney's Tone on Gay Rights Is Seen as Shift\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Bay Windows,\n <a href=\"http://baywindows.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=26587BAB4F7F4BB8BF70853D994A0151\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Romney: I'll be better than Ted for gay rights\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Mitt Romney,\n <a href=\"http://baywindows.com/Media/DesignImageLibrary/RomneyLogCabinLetter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\n  1994 letter to Massachusetts Log Cabin Republicans\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n Boston Globe, \"Romney Kin Signed Petition to Ban Same-Sex Marriage,\" March 22, 2002\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 34, "current_job": "Former governor", "false_count": 32, "first_name": "Mitt", "half_true_count": 58, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 5, "last_name": "Romney", "mostly_true_count": 33, "name_slug": "mitt-romney", "pants_count": 19, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-mittromney.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/5/", "total_count": 221, "true_count": 30, "website": "http://www.mittromney.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\"I have not changed my position on the (gay) marriage amendment or anything else related to marriage.\"</p>", "statement_context": "an interview on MSNBC", "statement_date": "2007-09-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 119, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/119/", "subject": "Families", "subject_slug": "families", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 118, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/118/", "subject": "Gays and Lesbians", "subject_slug": "gays-and-lesbians", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
