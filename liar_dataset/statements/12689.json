The FBI declined to recommend prosecution in Clinton&rsquo;s case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comey concluded that Clinton was wrong when she repeatedly said that classified emails didn&#39;t end up on her personal system and he characterized her handling of very sensitive information as &quot;extremely careless.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump told the crowd at a July 11 campaign rally in Virginia Beach, Va., that Clinton&#39;s conduct as &quot;willful, intentional, and unlawful.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Just look at what the FBI director said about her &mdash; her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country,&quot; Trump said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comey was tough on Clinton, saying at one point that any reasonable person in Clinton&#39;s position &quot;should have known that an unclassified system was no place&quot; for some of the conversations she was having. But we didn&#39;t recall him saying her conduct was &quot;a disgrace&quot; or an &quot;embarrassment.&quot; So we decided to check it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump campaign doesn&#39;t regularly respond to PolitiFact&#39;s requests for information. But in this case, the Trump campaign posted the speech (as prepared but without his extemporaneous remarks) <a href=\"https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/America_First_Means_Veterans_First.pdf\">with annotations</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/America_First_Means_Veterans_First.pdf\">speech transcript</a> specifically indicates, via the dash, that Trump was explaining the remarks of the FBI director,&nbsp;not just giving his own opinion.&nbsp;Trump&#39;s delivery <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?412560-1/donald-trump-delivers-remarks-veterans-issues\">on video</a> makes it sound that way, too, and that&#39;s what caught our attention.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The campaign said that the source for the &quot;disgrace and embarrassment&quot; line came from the <em>Washington Post</em>&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/05/inside-james-comeys-shockingly-scathing-comments-about-hillary-clintons-email-setup/\">transcript of Comey&#39;s July 5 news conference</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We checked. Neither the words &quot;disgrace&quot; nor &quot;embarrassment&quot; are contained in the transcript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We checked <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4921643?3\">Congressional Quarterly&#39;s</a> transcript. Same result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if Comey might have used the words during the hours he spent before the House committee two days later. <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/congressionaltranscripts-4923549?7\">He did not</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We read his public comments again, looking for words that mean the same thing as a disgrace or an embarrassment. We didn&rsquo;t find them. Instead, Comey used words that focused on her conduct as showing a lack of attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think she was extremely careless. I think she was negligent. That, I could establish. What we can&#39;t establish is that she acted with the necessary criminal intent,&quot; was about as harsh as Comey got.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He declined to say whether Clinton lied to the public. He did suggest that Clinton may have been less sophisticated about email than most people assumed. &quot;She didn&#39;t have a computer in her office at the State Department, for example,&quot; Comey said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if <em>anybody</em> used the words &quot;disgrace&quot; or &quot;embarrassment&quot; during the hearing. They did not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;Just look at what the FBI director said about her (Hillary Clinton) &mdash; her misconduct &nbsp;is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump campaign indicated Comey said it during his news conference. He didn&#39;t. He said her actions were careless, but he didn&rsquo;t call them a disgrace or an embarrassment or the equivalent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s possible that Trump was trying to convey two different thoughts, urging people to look up the FBI director&#39;s comments and the &quot;disgrace and embarrassment&quot; comment was supposed to be his own characterization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&#39;s not how it comes across, both when spoken and in the transcript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that in mind, we rate it False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b1a6a5e7-b27c-496b-a3cd-73f65def2f05\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b1a6a5e7-b27c-496b-a3cd-73f65def2f05</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-15T10:40:59.386200", "ruling_date": "2016-07-15T11:16:28", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump mischaracterizes FBI director comment about Hillary Clinton's email practices", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-mischaract-fbi-director-comment-about", "ruling_link_text": "Quote misquote", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>C-SPAN, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?412560-1/donald-trump-delivers-remarks-veterans-issues\">Donald Trump Remarks on Veterans&#39;
