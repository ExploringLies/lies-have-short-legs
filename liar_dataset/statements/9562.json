If the municipalities don&rsquo;t pay up, the state withholds aid to make up the shortfall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the current fiscal year, Cranston&rsquo;s minimum was 13.69 percent of payroll; the city&rsquo;s budget includes that amount -- about $4.8 million on the non-school side of the ledger. In other words, it&rsquo;s paying 100 percent of the state-mandated MERS requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the funding level, the percentage of what the plans need to meet their pension obligations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city&rsquo;s MERS plans are not funded exactly at 100 percent, but they&#39;re fairly close. According to the <a href=\"https://d10k7k7mywg42z.cloudfront.net/assets/52b99ddcd6af685c57000fbd/MERS2013.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>latest actuarial report</u></a>, the city has 95.9 percent of the projected police retiree costs, 107.1 percent of the projected firefighter retiree costs, and 95.1 percent of all other municipal retiree costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any plan with a funded ratio below 80 percent is considered to be in trouble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the old police and fire pension programs, administered by the city, are a different story because, over the years, Cranston&#39;s elected officials neglected to put enough money into those programs to cover future retiree costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although they have been closed since 1995, the city would need an additional $231 million to fully fund them. (To put that amount in perspective, the <a href=\"http://www.cranstonri.com/pdf/FY15%20Adopted%20Budget.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>city&#39;s entire budget</u></a> for the current fiscal year is $262 million.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old police pension is only 18.3 percent funded and the old fire pension program is just 24.1 percent funded, according to information from the <a href=\"http://www.cranstonri.com/pdf/Cranston%202013%20Valuation_FINAL.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>city&#39;s latest actuarial report</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&rsquo;re far from 100-percent funded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the city is now on a payment plan designed to wipe out that shortfall by 2042. (The date has been 2037, but a recent court settlement with the unions forced the date to be pushed back by five years.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under that plan, the city should be paying $22,353,591 this year, according to the city&#39;s actuarial firm, Buck Consultants. Fung, in an email to PolitiFact Rhode Island, showed where the city&#39;s appropriation for this year will actually be $22,518 more than the recommended amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To cover other benefits, primarily retiree health insurance, Buck recommended that the city budget $5.1 million. The city has set aside $4.6 million and plans to cover the remaining $500,000 by using about a third of its $1.6 million hospital stabilization account, which is savings accumulated because the city self-insures its workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fung, in an interview, said he didn&#39;t intend to leave the impression in his letter to taxpayers that the city had covered 100 percent of all its pension obligations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If I had meant that, I would have said it was 100 percent fully funded, which is not true.&quot; Instead, he said his point was that, unlike in past years, the city is paying for 100 percent of its annual required contribution to solve its pension problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that Fung has not been shy about talking about the unfunded liability of the city&#39;s old pension systems, mentioning it in interviews and on other occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cranston Mayor Allan Fung said, &quot;Our budget funds 100 percent of the local police and fire pension and other retiree benefit costs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city is making the minimum required payments for retirement benefits through the state-run MERS system and to pay down this year&#39;s share of the bill for the huge long-term liability incurred by the city&#39;s older police and fire pension systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But his statement could lead a reader to conclude that 100 percent of the city&rsquo;s $231 million debt for the old plans is covered by this year&#39;s budget when, in fact, the only thing the city is paying in full is this year&#39;s installment on a plan that won&#39;t retire that debt for another 28 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>Mostly True</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>PolitiFact Rhode Island</u></a> to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
