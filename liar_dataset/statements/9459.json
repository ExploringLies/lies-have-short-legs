Bowe Bergdahl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is not and there is no way that he could be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image reportedly was tweeted by the man in the photo on March 15 and not one of the five Taliban prisoners. We say <em>reportedly </em>because the original tweet has since been removed. However,&nbsp;we can use news accounts to piece together what happened -- and why this image is not of the Taliban prisoners.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, the five Taliban officials were released May 31, 2014, more than two months after the image was first released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tha man who originally tweeted the image&nbsp;goes by the name Abdurahman.&nbsp;Abdurahman&nbsp;came from Iraq and lived in Holland for 10 years before returning to fight in Syria and Iraq. The image was the source of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2686/Binnenland/article/detail/3615123/2014/03/17/Nederlandse-Syrieganger-op-de-foto-met-vijf-afgehakte-hoofden.dhtml\"><u>an article in </u><em><u>de</u><u> </u><u>Volkskrant</u></em></a>, a major Dutch newspaper, on March 17.&nbsp;The article identifies the man in the image<strong> </strong>as Khalid K. from Almere, Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the photo itself is no longer available on the Web, the description in the <em>Volkskrant </em>article matches the image in Nugent&rsquo;s post. An American blog post from March 23 leaves no doubt the images are the same. The site <a href=\"http://www.dcclothesline.com/2014/03/23/head-shot-dutch-muslim-lived-welfare-10-years-poses-five-heads/\"><u>D.C. Clothesline</u></a> links back to the <em>Volkskrant </em>and includes the photo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On April 17, Live Leak, a British-based image and video sharing website, carried an entry with the photo. The headline was, &quot;<u><a href=\"http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=652_1397727681\">Dutch-Iraqi ISIS terrorist cannibal butcher and behead five Al Qaeda terrorists beheader</a></u>&nbsp;(sic).&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How&#39;d things get mixed up?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image returned recently with people claiming it was Mohammad Fazl, one of the five Taliban prisoners swapped in exchange for Bergdahl.<strong> </strong>The urban myth website <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/photos/politics/fazl.asp\"><u>Snopes reviewed the revival of the disturbing photo</u></a> on June 10. It noted that&nbsp;the image had appeared many times on Facebook with the claim that the man was &quot;Mohammad Fazi (sic), just one of those great terrorists that this administration traded for the deserter. He seems like a really&nbsp;proud terrorist in this photo. I sure hope everyone feels safer knowing this guy is now free.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without using Mohammed Fazl&rsquo;s name, Nugent apparently borrowed much from such posts. Fazl is a former Taliban deputy defense minister, one of the five men released from Guantanamo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GVblFTiznR2sf8gFW42xIq51D6KpZIbx2BHDOdlyWkpp4dm3fh6n9GuDJa_p65xIxERXnOeolcQylaIVlDtG6l8KQdLC6Hci3N8d4Ok9TG5bLVkubodSWF83TDIJW4xVsA\" style=\"height:99px; width:80px\" /><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jGsJeeXLBxQL11NvBvPKaFmAaA3YXpQelRLiWQ9vm19e_1VOYSHBtQlc33xPeaUc-YENc7nxhbShwX1eposoZiXRz9K1N1-SyOBNdoxc7hFLVSAgnCSQXdAHV2STy0AGpw\" style=\"height:99px; width:88px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Mohammed Fazl (left) and Abdurahman (right).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted Nugent&rsquo;s office for comment and did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nugent said a man squatting behind five heads had been set free by President Barack Obama to secure the freedom of an American soldier.
