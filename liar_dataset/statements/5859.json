They can&rsquo;t be spent on maintenance. We have a maintenance problem. That&rsquo;s a different pot of revenue. It&rsquo;s not what systems development charges pays for.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSmith argued that if we&rsquo;re not collecting systems development charges to pay for capital construction related to growth then that money has to come out of the general fund that should be used to pay for maintenance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWho&rsquo;s right?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSmith is flatly inaccurate in suggesting the law has changed.
