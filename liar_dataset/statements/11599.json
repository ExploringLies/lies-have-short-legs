David Vitter entered the Louisiana governor&rsquo;s race this year as the clear front-runner. But a prostitution scandal from years ago has left Vitter, a veteran Republican with widespread name recognition in the deep red state, in a difficult race against a lesser-known Democrat, state Rep. John Bel Edwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Louisiana&rsquo;s open primary on Oct. 24, Edwards finished first among four candidates; Vitter was a distant second. Two weeks later, Edwards&rsquo; campaign released an ad called &quot;The Choice.&quot; It highlights Vitter&rsquo;s connection to &quot;D.C. Madam&quot; Deborah Palfrey, <a href=\"http://blog.nola.com/updates/2007/07/vitter_had_five_calls_with_dc.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>which was revealed in 2007</u></a> when an investigator working for Hustler obtained phone records from Palfrey and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2515314-hustler-press-release-with-phone-records.html#document/p4/a262109\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>identified Vitter&rsquo;s number</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vitter&rsquo;s connection to Palfrey isn&rsquo;t new. For years he avoided the issue after obliquely addressing it in 2007. It apparently had little effect on his 2010 bid for a second term in the Senate, <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/11/sen_david_vitter_wins_re-elect.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>which he won easily</u></a>. But his connection to the D.C. Madam has percolated in <a href=\"http://theadvocate.com/news/13425615-123/david-vitters-murky-past-with\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>this year&rsquo;s governor&rsquo;s race</u></a> as <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/10/david-vitter-louisiana-governors-race-lovechild-allegation\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>new allegations emerged</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Edwards&rsquo; ad, released the day before early voting began for the general election, put the issue on TV screens throughout the state. After it was released, &quot;Meet the Press&quot; host <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-transcript-november-8-2015-n459476\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Chuck Todd said</u></a> it &quot;might be the most vicious negative ad ever.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad features a female narrator who says:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>The choice for governor couldn&rsquo;t be more clear. John Bel Edwards, who answered our country&rsquo;s call and served as a ranger in the 82nd Airborne Division, or David Vitter, who answered a prostitute&rsquo;s call minutes after he skipped a vote honoring 28 soldiers who gave their lives in defense of our freedom. David Vitter chose prostitutes over patriots. Now the choice is yours.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad makes two claims about Vitter: He skipped a vote for a resolution honoring American soldiers killed in the line of duty, and he answered a call from Palfrey&rsquo;s phone soon after. It then concludes that Vitter &quot;chose prostitutes over patriots,&quot; suggesting the two are related.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The basics are not hard to substantiate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then-U.S. Rep. David Vitter did, in fact, <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2001/roll016.xml\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>miss the vote in question</u></a>. On Feb. 27, 2001, the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution to honor 28 soldiers killed in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm, with 395 votes in favor. Two congressmen answered &quot;present&quot; but did not vote. Vitter was one of 35 marked absent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Vitter&rsquo;s campaign where he was that day, but the campaign declined to answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were no other roll-call votes that day, according to House records, nor were there any the day before, the first day after a congressional recess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That vote was recorded at 5:27 p.m. ET. Thirty-nine minutes later, at 6:06 p.m. in Washington, a call was placed from Palfrey&rsquo;s cell phone to Vitter&rsquo;s, <a href=\"http://blog.nola.com/updates/2007/07/vitter_had_five_calls_with_dc.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>according to her cell phone records</u></a>. It lasted about a minute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the presence of a call on a phone bill doesn&rsquo;t mean that Vitter picked up, rather than his voicemail. (If you find this fascinating, we recommend the&nbsp;podcast &quot;Serial,&quot; which&nbsp;<a href=\"http://serialpodcast.org/season-one/6/the-case-against-adnan-syed\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>explores such issues in detail</u></a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vitter has never directly admitted or denied patronizing Palfrey&rsquo;s service, though he&rsquo;s come close. In 2007, after media outlets reported Hustler&rsquo;s findings, he apologized in a statement for a &quot;<a href=\"http://blog.nola.com/times-picayune/2007/07/sen_vitters_number_appears_on.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>very serious sin</u></a>&quot; but didn&rsquo;t elaborate. He&rsquo;s been similarly evasive during this year&rsquo;s governor&rsquo;s race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an ad his campaign released after &quot;The Choice,&quot; Vitter says, &quot;Fifteen years ago, I failed my family,&quot; but it <a href=\"http://theadvocate.com/news/acadiana/13929750-171/new-david-vitter-campaign-ad\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>elaborates no further</u></a>. Asked this week during a debate if he took the call, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/louisiana-vitter-edwards-governor-215960\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Vitter refused to answer</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, Vitter&rsquo;s campaign did not respond to our questions about the ad. Edwards&rsquo; campaign did not respond to a request for additional evidence beyond what&rsquo;s cited in the ad. (Palfrey died in 2008.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Vitter unwilling to talk, we wondered if he was even in Washington that day, considering that Feb. 27, 2001, was Mardi Gras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a big deal in Louisiana, and Vitter has <a href=\"http://www.vitter.senate.gov/newsroom/newsletters/from-davids-desk-january-roundup-2013\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>expressed great personal fondness</u></a> for the holiday. Considering that Carnival coincided with Congress&rsquo; winter break, it was possible that Vitter was back in Louisiana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he was in Washington that night. As Louisiana State University Professor Robert Mann <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2015/11/06/david_vitter_hooker_shocker_new_charges_that_louisiana_pol_missed_vote_honoring_soldiers_while_scheduling_prostitute_rendezvous/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>noted in a recent Salon column</u></a>, President George W. Bush addressed a joint session of Congress at 9 p.m. Vitter is visible in the audience about <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4560766\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>24 minutes in</u></a> and <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4560768\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a half-hour later</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, a House report, detailing members&rsquo; use of congressional funds for office and travel expenses, shows that Vitter <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2515364-vitter-disbursements.html#document/p1/a262107\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>claimed an airfare expense that day</u></a>. Flight records from the <a href=\"http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bureau of Transportation Statistics</u></a> show five direct flights from New Orleans to Washington-area airports that day prior to Bush&rsquo;s speech. Arrival times ranged from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There, our reporting on this track reached a dead end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Edwards&rsquo; ad says Vitter took a call from a prostitute minutes after skipping the vote. The only thing we don&rsquo;t know is if Vitter answered his phone. Even if he didn&rsquo;t, he has still been connected to the D.C. Madam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Choice&quot; doesn&rsquo;t quite close the deal in suggesting that Vitter missed the vote because of his dealings with a prostitute, which is what it suggests when it says he &quot;chose prostitutes over patriots.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the key parts of the statement in question &mdash; that Vitter &quot;answered a prostitute&rsquo;s call minutes after he skipped a vote&quot; &mdash; are accurate.
