Compared to west Africa, America has well-resourced health care services, as well as federal programs and agencies dedicated to preventing public health crises in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s no thanks to Rep. Tom Cotton, says incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Pryor in his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-DwHaEwXfY\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>most recent ad</u></a>. Pryor&rsquo;s running against Cotton, a Republican, to keep his seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tom Cotton voted against preparing America for pandemics like Ebola,&quot; the ad&rsquo;s narrator says. &quot;Congressman Cotton voted to cut billions from our nation&rsquo;s medical disaster and emergency programs. He was the only Arkansas congressman to vote this way. Just like he was the only one to vote against Children&rsquo;s Hospital. Instead, Cotton voted massive tax cuts for billionaires. Not protect our families&rsquo; health and safety.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a tea party Republican, Cotton has a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/09/tom-cotton/rep-tom-cotton-defends-his-voting-record-disaster-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>history</u></a> of voting against federal government spending, including spending on <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/01/senate-majority-pac/did-arkansas-rep-tom-cotton-vote-against-disaster-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>disaster relief</u></a>. But tying Cotton to a potential Ebola outbreak caught our attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The vote</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, Ebola has killed more than 1,400 people in west Africa as of Aug. 20 and is the largest ever recorded outbreak, according to the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_08_22_ebola/en/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>World Health Organization</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No cases have been recorded in the United States, though two American health care workers contracted the virus while in Liberia and were treated in an Atlanta hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Pryor&rsquo;s campaign for evidence backing up their claim, and they said the ad refers to the <a href=\"http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/pahpa/Pages/pahpra.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013</u></a>. The law -- passed in March 2013 -- continues funding various medical and public health emergency preparedness programs through 2018. (The first iteration of the law was passed in 2006.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you might guess from the name, the law pertains to preventing pandemics, like Ebola, from breaking out in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several programs funded under the act are already working on Ebola response, such as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, said Gretchen Michaels, a spokeswoman for the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the law&rsquo;s 2013 reauthorization gave the Food and Drug Administration the ability to authorize use of unapproved products in the case of an emergency. So <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/EmergencySituations/ucm161496.htm#ebola\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>earlier this month</u></a>, the FDA authorized use of a new tool for diagnosing Ebola, as well as <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/guinea/qa-experimental-treatments.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>an experimental treatment</u></a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Cotton try to stop this legislation? At first, it seems that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h24\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The House</u></a> passed the legislation Jan. 22, 2013, with strong bipartisan support and very little opposition -- 395 to 29. Cotton voted against it, along with 28 other Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill moved on to the Senate, where lawmakers made a few changes, passed it by a voice vote, and sent it back to the House to approve the changes. The House once again <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h56\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>passed the Senate&rsquo;s version</u></a> of the bill with an overwhelming majority from both parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time around, Cotton changed his position and voted for the bill. (Seven other Republicans who previously voted &quot;nay&quot; also changed their vote.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not clear why Cotton didn&rsquo;t vote for it the first time. The law passed with such little debate that it went over without much media attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to Cotton&rsquo;s campaign but haven&rsquo;t heard back -- though they posted <a href=\"http://www.tomcotton.com/2014/08/pryor-says-cotton-is-spreading-ebola/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>an article</u></a> on their website refuting the claim. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <em><a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/weeklyreport-4234514?8\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>CQ Weekly</u></a>, </em>the major difference between the House and Senate version of the act is that the House version approves funding and programs through 2017, while the Senate version goes through 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also used a <a href=\"https://www.diffchecker.com\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>tool to compare differences</u></a> between the two texts and found that the final version includes a clause clarifying that state and local workers asked to temporarily take on a different assignment in case of an emergency would not be required to accept that reassignment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless, the country&rsquo;s ability to address a pandemic does not hinge on either of those changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no readily available evidence showing that Cotton actively campaigned against the bill. And the final version, which got Cotton&rsquo;s vote, also got positive votes from nearly every Senate and House Democrat -- including Pryor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Pryor for Senate ad said, &quot;Tom Cotton voted against preparing America for pandemics like Ebola.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cotton voted against one version of a 2013 pandemic and emergency preparedness bill. However, Cotton voted for the final version, which Pryor also supported. The bill easily became law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-28T13:53:14.591622", "ruling_date": "2014-08-28T14:12:52", "ruling_headline": "Pryor says Cotton voted 'no' on pandemic prevention bill, ignores Cotton's 'yes' vote", "ruling_headline_slug": "pryor-says-cotton-voted-no-pandemic-prevention-bil", "ruling_link_text": "Ebola wormed its way into the election", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Pryor campaign, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-DwHaEwXfY\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Emergency Response</u></a>,&quot;
