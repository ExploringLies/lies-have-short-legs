The real number may be higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either way, Carson&rsquo;s original claim, that &quot;every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience,&quot; is way, way off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The signers had &#39;no federal elected office experience&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The edit Carson made to the Facebook post doesn&rsquo;t help his case, since there was no federal government before the Declaration of Independence was signed. This makes his entire claim illogical, experts say,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Of course they did not have federal elected office experience because there was no federal government at the time -- we were a British colony,&quot; said Michael Gerhardt, scholar in residence at the National Constitution Center and professor of constitutional law at the University of North Carolina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It does not make sense to use the term &lsquo;federal&rsquo; when no federal government existed,&quot; agreed Danielle Allen, a political theorist and author of <em>Our Declaration: A Reading of the Declaration of Independence in Defense of Equality</em>. &quot;The signers of the declaration very often had leading political experience in their colony or, as they called them, in their &lsquo;countries.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jan Lewis, a professor of history at Rutgers University-Newark and the author of <em>The Pursuit of Happiness: Family and Values in Jefferson&rsquo;s Virginia</em>, finds Carson&rsquo;s claim ridiculous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It makes about as much sense as saying none of them had been to the moon,&quot; Lewis said. &quot;Of course they hadn&#39;t, because it was an impossibility at that time. No one could possibly serve in the federal government before there was a federal government, at least in the absence of time travel.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carson&rsquo;s staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the initial and the revised versions of Carson&rsquo;s claim are far off base. About half or more of the declaration&rsquo;s signers had held elective office previously, a reality that severely undercuts Carson&rsquo;s overall point that the drafting of the Declaration of Independence showed how a lack of political experience can produce landmark political achievements. As for his later addition of &quot;federal&quot; to the comment, this makes the claim nonsensical, since there was no federal government prior to the signing of the declaration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Carson&rsquo;s claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-06T14:18:02.802874", "ruling_date": "2015-11-08T10:30:24", "ruling_headline": "Ben Carson's Pants on Fire claim that no signer of the Declaration of Independence held office", "ruling_headline_slug": "ben-carson-said-no-one-who-signed-declaration-inde", "ruling_link_text": "Claim is no more correct after editing", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Ben Carson, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/realbencarson/posts/549786315187839\">Facebook post</a>, Nov. 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USHistory.org, <a href=\"http://www.ushistory.org/Declaration/Signers/index.htm\">Signers of the Declaration of Independence</a>, accessed Nov. 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post </em>Fact Checker, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/05/ben-carsons-absurd-notion-that-the-founding-fathers-had-no-elected-office-experience/\">Ben Carson&rsquo;s absurd notion that the Founding Fathers had &lsquo;no elected office experience</a>,&rsquo; &quot; Nov. 5, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Emily Sneff, research manager of the Declaration Resources Project at Harvard University, Nov. 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Andrew J.
