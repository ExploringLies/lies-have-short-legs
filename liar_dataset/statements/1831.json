Jeb Bush.<br /><br />During the 30-second commercial, Bush speaks about McCollum's accomplishments:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em><span id=\":1ht\" dir=\"ltr\">\"Tough times require proven leadership.<br /><br /><span id=\":1ht\" dir=\"ltr\">\"</span>Bill McCollum is a principled conservative with a record of doing what is right for Florida.<br /><br />\"Bill&rsquo;s recovered nearly $200 million in Medicaid fraud.<br /><br /><span id=\":1ht\" dir=\"ltr\">\"</span>He&rsquo;s leading the charge to stop President Obama&rsquo;s health care takeover.<br /><br /><span id=\":1ht\" dir=\"ltr\">\"</span>And, he has a plan to create 500,000 new jobs, reform government and cut wasteful spending.<br /><br /><span id=\":1ht\" dir=\"ltr\">\"</span>Support my friend Bill McCollum, the kind of solid leader Florida needs.\"</span></em></p>\r\n<p>We decided to focus on this claim: \"Bill's recovered nearly $200 million in Medicaid fraud.\"</p>\r\n<p>Increasingly Medicaid accounts for a huge chunk of the state budget, with Florida spending roughly $19 billion for the program that serves 2.7 million people, or 14 percent of Florida's population. And fraud is a big problem.<strong> </strong>Annually, some $3.2 billion in Medicaid fraud is bilked from the state and federal governments.</p>\r\n<p>To check whether McCollum has made a dent in curbing that fraud, we asked McCollum campaign spokesman Kristy Campbell for documentation. She gave us a March 9 press release from the Attorney General's office. <br /><br />\"I am proud of the record-breaking recoveries my Medicaid Fraud Control Unit has made over the last three years, including $198 million last year,\" McCollum says in the release.<br /><br />Next, the Attorney General's office provided us with a list of recoveries from the Medicaid Control Unit for 2009.<strong> </strong>The list of 153 cases includes settlements that reach into the millions, like $32 million to be paid by pharmeceutical giant Eli Lilly, and&nbsp;smaller sums like $50,000 to be paid by Hialeah physician Ausberto B. Hidalgo.</p>\r\n<p>Adding up the itemized list, the sum is actually $203 million. So Bush is almost on the money.<br /><br />We should note that the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit has been around since way before McCollum became attorney general. The unit started under the auditor general's office, but in July 1994 it was moved under the Attorney General's Office as a way to police the state's burgeoning Medicaid program. And McCollum has come under attack from state officials in both the Republican and Democratic parties for not doing enough.<br /><br />As for Bush's claim that McCollum \"recovered nearly $200 million in Medicaid Fraud,\" we rate it True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-05-27T14:04:47.236600", "ruling_date": "2010-06-14T10:26:09", "ruling_headline": "Bill McCollum claims he recovered nearly $200 million in Medicaid fraud", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-mccollum-claims-he-recovered-nearly-200-milli", "ruling_link_text": "Actually recovered $203 million, but can't take full credit", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>St. Petersburg Times, The Buzz political Blog, <a href=\"http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/2010/05/jeb-stars-in-bill-mccollums-first-tv-spot.html\" target=\"_blank\">\"Jeb stars in Bill McCollum's first TV spot.\"</a> , May 20, 2010<br /><br />YouTube, Video: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbMIfMa4KHo&amp;feature=player_embedded\" target=\"_blank\">\"Jeb Bush Endorsement of Bill McCollum\"</a>, May 20, 2010<br /><br />State Attorney General's website, <a href=\"http://myfloridalegal.com/pages.nsf/Main/ebc480598bbf32d885256cc6005b54d1\" target=\"_blank\">Medical Fraud Control Unit explanation</a>, May 24, 2010<br /><br />State Attorney General's Office, \"Medicaid Fraud Control Unit Total Recoveries 2009,\" May 26, 2010, acquired through a public records request<br /><br />State Attorney General's Office, Press Release, \"<a href=\"http://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrel.nsf/newsreleases/449B2988CF96DC0A852576E10064B85D\" target=\"_blank\">Attorney General, Senate President Unveil Legislation Targeting Medicaid Fraud,</a>\" March 9, 2010<br /><br />Miami Herald, \"Sink Hits Medicaid Fraud\", March 5, 2010<br /><br />Miami Herald, \"Senate Pushes Medicaid Reform,\" April 1, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 18, "current_job": "", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Jeb", "half_true_count": 17, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 436, "last_name": "Bush", "mostly_true_count": 24, "name_slug": "jeb-bush", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Jeb_Bush.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/436/", "total_count": 80, "true_count": 14, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Bill McCollum&nbsp;has \"recovered $200 million in Medicaid fraud.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a campaign commercial for Bill McCollum", "statement_date": "2010-05-20", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 112, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/112/", "subject": "Florida", "subject_slug": "florida", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 157, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/157/", "subject": "Message Machine 2010", "subject_slug": "message-machine", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
