Then-Gov. Zell Miller announced his support for the idea a year later, and it became Georgia law shortly thereafter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThurmond, the Democratic Party&#39;s nominee for the U.S. Senate in the Nov. 2 general election, boasted about the bill&#39;s impact on his campaign website. He is running against incumbent Johnny Isakson, a Republican, and Libertarian Party candidate Chuck Donovan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Thurmond authored major legislation that has provided more than $250 million in tax relief to Georgia&rsquo;s senior citizens and working families,&quot; his campaign bio says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut is that true? Did Thurmond write the legislation, and did it save Georgians that much money?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAJC PolitiFact Georgia was curious. We first called Thurmond, who was eager to talk about the statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThurmond said his legislation was written to help offset the sales taxes low-income Georgians pay for groceries. Miller was part of a push in the late 1980s to remove groceries from Georgia&#39;s 4 percent sales tax. Thurmond offered his suggestion as a compromise. Miller initially opposed Thurmond&#39;s idea. But Miller eventually endorsed the plan after being told his idea was not financially viable, particularly since state finances were struggling.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMiller said he was &quot;swallowing his pride of authorship.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe refunds in question were relatively small -- they ranged between $5 and $26. Thurmond said the refunds may seem puny to some, but he argued they were a big help to many recipients.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;For a senior citizen, that might be dinner for a week,&quot; Thurmond said of $26.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThurmond&#39;s desire to discuss the claim stems from a successful effort earlier this year to repeal the key portion of his legislation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState lawmakers added language to a bill on the next to last day of this year&#39;s session that ends the refunds. Gov. Sonny Perdue signed the bill on June 4.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThurmond argues his legislation has helped senior citizens and low-income Georgians. He equates ending the refunds to a tax increase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I just don&#39;t believe we need to be raising taxes in the midst of a recession, particularly on low-income people,&quot; Thurmond said in an interview.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState Rep. David Knight, R-Griffin, was the lead sponsor of the effort to repeal the refunds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;People who have paid in no income tax and have zero tax liability are in essence getting a check back,&quot; Knight told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in April about the current system. &quot;If you pay no income taxes, how can you get a refund? How can you justify someone getting a check back from the state? That is, in its purest form, taking away from the taxpayer and giving to someone who has no tax liability. [It&#39;s] a redistribution of wealth.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThurmond argues the sales tax has a greater proportional impact on the wallets of low-income Georgians. Sarah Beth Guhl, deputy director of the liberal-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, explained Thurmond&#39;s point in an e-mail.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Low-income families consume more of their income, and thus pay the sales tax on a larger portion of their earnings,&quot; said Guhl, who agreed with Thurmond that a sales tax is regressive on low-income Georgians.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThurmond admitted an error in his statement the first time we talked to him. The legislation provided about $300.3 million in tax relief over the span of 13 years, according to the most recent Georgia Department of Revenue data available. Thurmond sold himself short by about $50 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It lacks the truth in a positive direction,&quot; Thurmond said in a telephone interview.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Thurmond campaign came to the $250 million total using data available on the Revenue Department&#39;s website. The data comes from the department&#39;s annual statistical reports. The reports on the Revenue Department&#39;s Web site, however, only go back to 2000. The Revenue Department has reports that date to 1997 with annual low-income credit figures in its north DeKalb County offices.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Thurmond&#39;s website gives him some serious wiggle room by saying &quot;more than $250 million in tax relief.&quot; We rate his statement as True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-30T17:01:11.710240", "ruling_date": "2010-08-31T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Thurmond claims legislation helped low-income Georgians", "ruling_headline_slug": "thurmond-claims-legislation-helped-low-income-geor", "ruling_link_text": "Thurmond sells himself short on claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAtlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;Miller gives up on food exemption; Citing poor economy, governor opts for low-income tax credit,&quot; Feb. 26, 1991<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAtlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;Senate passes measure killing refund part of low-income tax credit,&quot; April 24, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail and telephone interview with Georgia Budget and Policy Institute deputy director Sarah Beth Guhl, Aug. 27, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia Department of Revenue <a href=\"https://etax.dor.ga.gov/gaforms/publica.aspx\">publications</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia House of Representatives, <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2009_10/sum/hb1069.htm\">House Bill 1069</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMike Thurmond for U.S. Senate <a href=\"http://www.mikethurmond2010.com/about.php\">bio</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview with Mike Thurmond, Aug. 23, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Labor Commissioner", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Michael", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 628, "last_name": "Thurmond", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "michael-thurmond", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Michael_Thurmond.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/628/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tMichael Thurmond &quot;authored major legislation that has provided more than $250 million in tax relief to Georgia&rsquo;s senior citizens and working families.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "his campaign website", "statement_date": "2010-04-30", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Labor Commissioner", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Michael", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 628, "last_name": "Thurmond", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "michael-thurmond", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Michael_Thurmond.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/628/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": "Thurmond sells himself short on claim. #gapolitics"}
