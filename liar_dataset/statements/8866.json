He addressed a proposal to eliminate extra points, saying they&rsquo;re almost automatic (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/31/roger-goodell/nfls-goodell-extra-point-almost-automatic/\"><u>as we previously reported, they are</u></a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And he discussed the health of NFL players amid concern that the sport is too violent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goodell offered a defense that we hadn&rsquo;t heard before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Our players are living, on average, longer than the average male,&quot; Goodell said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After serious talk <a href=\"http://nfl.si.com/2014/01/14/nfl-concussion-lawsuit-settlement-2/\"><u>about concussions</u></a> in the NFL and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/25/us/former-nfl-player-suicide/\"><u>some prominent suicides in the sport</u></a>, we wondered about Goodell&rsquo;s claim. It&rsquo;s accurate, it turns out, but requires some additional explanation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a government&nbsp;research agency within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, studied the mortality rates of former NFL football players in a report <a href=\"http://www.ajconline.org/article/S0002-9149(11)03387-X/fulltext\"><u>released in 2012</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study included nearly all NFL players who played in the league for five or more years from 1959 to 1988 -- a pool of 3,439 men. Researchers said based on current mortality rates, they expected 625 players to be deceased. But by the end of 2007, only 334 were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We found the players in our study had a much lower rate of death overall compared to men in the general population,&quot; researchers wrote to the NFL players <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pgms/worknotify/pdfs/NFL_Notification_01.pdf\"><u>in a March 2012 letter</u></a>. &quot;This means that, on average, NFL players are actually living longer than men in the general &nbsp;population.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The former NFL players also had lower rates of heart disease and cancer compared to average males, the report found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few important caveats to point out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NFL players aren&#39;t like your average male in a number of ways. They are professional athletes, many of whom might be wealthy, and they are likely to&nbsp;have access to quality health care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report also raised red flags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers found that men who were considered obese, those with a Body Mass Index of 30 or more when they played, had twice the risk of death from heart disease than other players. African-American players also had a higher heart disease risk than Caucasian players, the report found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important note: Because the study excludes modern-day players, it fails to account for the changing physique of today&rsquo;s football player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the 3,439 men in the NIOSH study, only 1 percent had a Body Mass Index of 35 or more when they played, and 33 percent had a Body Mass Index between 30 and 35.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s NFL players are much bigger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To create an example, we looked at the current 53-man roster of the <a href=\"http://www.denverbroncos.com/team/roster.html\"><u>Denver Broncos</u></a> and calculated each player&rsquo;s Body Mass Index using a calculator from the <a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/BMI/bmicalc.htm\"><u>National Institutes of Health</u></a>. Of 53 Broncos players, 13 have a Body Index above 35 (24.5 percent) and another 14 have a Body Mass Index between 30 and 35 (26.4 percent).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s an important distinction that may affect the results of future studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Our ruling</strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goodell said that NFL &quot;players are living, on average, longer than the average male.&quot; His claim is backed up by a government study that examined former NFL players who played from 1959 to 1988.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the study, which was released in 2012, did conclude that bigger players had an increased risk of dying from heart disease and did not evaluate more modern-day players. Modern-day players are bigger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Goodell&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-02-02T10:47:06.467305", "ruling_date": "2014-02-02T12:25:08", "ruling_headline": "NFL's Goodell says players live longer than average male", "ruling_headline_slug": "nfls-goodell-says-players-live-longer-average-male", "ruling_link_text": "Study examines players from 1959 to 1988", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Fox News Sunday</em>, interview with Roger Goodell, Feb. 2, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NIOSH, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pgms/worknotify/pdfs/NFL_Notification_01.pdf\"><u>Heart health concerns for NFL Players</u></a>,&quot; accessed Feb. 2, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/sports/football/nfl-players-live-longer-than-men-in-general-population-study-says.html?_r=0\"><u>N.F.L.
