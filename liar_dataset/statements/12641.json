They featured a photoshopped image of a smiling Zenzinger wearing sunglasses with dollar signs on the lenses and an ornamental Asian bridge in the background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer funded junket to China,&quot; the mailer said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The back of the mailer showed a pagoda and elaborated on the claim, saying, &quot;Zenzinger couldn&rsquo;t be trusted with taxpayer money on the city council -- we definitely can&rsquo;t trust her to oversee $26 billion in the State Senate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mailers were produced by Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government, a &nbsp;conservative 527 political group. 527s are tax-exempt entities (organized under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code) that can collect unlimited donations and influence a political issue, policy, appointment or election. But to maintain nonprofit status, the groups cannot expressly advocate that people vote <a href=\"https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/02/17/a-glossary-of-campaign-finance-in-the-u-s/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>for or against a candidate</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same group attacked Zenzinger for a taxpayer-backed junket to China in 2014. But just as before, there are key problems with these attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;ve never been to China,&quot; Zenzinger told PolitiFact. &quot;I was joking to friends, believe me if I had been to China, I would have had so many pictures on Facebook they wouldn&#39;t have to Photoshop my picture in the ads.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, while on the Arvada City Council in 2013, Zenzinger made -- and then voted for -- a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for a proposed sister-city delegation to China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No city officials ever went on the trip. But you wouldn&rsquo;t know that from this mailer, or a 2014 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=339q4aimIos&amp;index=3&amp;list=UUevQu4Ys9BVrhHCPY6E4SUQ\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>TV ad</u></a> called &quot;China Girl&quot; that targeted Zenzinger, who was running to hang onto her Senate seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/339q4aimIos?list=UUevQu4Ys9BVrhHCPY6E4SUQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zenzinger had been appointed in 2013 to the District 19 seat to replace Democratic Sen. Evie Hudak, who resigned in the face of a recall effort by gun-rights groups angered by gun-control laws passed by Democratic lawmakers after the deadly mass shooting at an Aurora movie theater in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zenzinger lost the election by 663 votes to Republican candidate Laura Woods &mdash; a defeat she blames on the misleading TV ad and mailers with the same misleading theme. Now Zenzinger is running in a rematch against&nbsp;Woods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I would knock on people&#39;s doors and they&#39;d be like, &#39;Oh yeah, you went to China,&rsquo; &quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if there was no trip, what is the mailer talking about?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A 2013 council meeting</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As evidence, Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government emailed PolitiFact a brief excerpt from the <a href=\"http://www.arvadarecords.org/councilpacket/past24_minutes/2013...04-01-2013%20City%20Council%20Meeting%20Minutes.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>minutes of an Arvada City Council meeting on April 1, 2013</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Council members were discussing an invitation from the mayor of Arvada&rsquo;s sister city, Jinzhou, China, to send an official delegation from Arvada to the 2013 World Landscape Art Exposition. A nonprofit group, <a href=\"http://arvadasistercities.org/projects-programs\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Arvada Sister Cities International</u></a>, recommended that the invitation be accepted and that an official delegation -- including Arvada city officials, members of the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Arvada Sister Cities -- attend the Jinzhou expo.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Councilman Bob Dyer made a motion to accept the group&rsquo;s<strong> </strong>recommendation and send a delegation to Jinzhou, according to the meeting minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the vote on the motion, the 527 group points out, Mayor Marc Williams said he was uncomfortable using public funds on the trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mayor said &quot;since he understands the motion includes sending delegation members from the city at city expense, he cannot support it,&quot; according to the minutes. However, he said he would back sending Zenzinger as the elected representative if her travel was privately funded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zenzinger voted for the Dyer motion to send a delegation, but it failed, 4-3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the end of the meeting. The group attacking Zenzinger left out what happened next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zenzinger then made her own motion, saying if a city delegation was sent, the money would come from a non-city source. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Councilmember Cook asked if Ms. Zenzinger is suggesting that no city costs be used in the delegation and Mayor Pro Tem Zenzinger said yes,&quot; the minutes state. &quot;Mayor Pro Tem Zenzinger clarified...that if Sister Cities is unable to fund them, then we would come back and decline the invitation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zenzinger&rsquo;s motion passed on a 5-2 vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, no city officials or employees went to China because no private funding was found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Outrageous fabrications&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several people who were at the council meeting on the China delegation proposal blasted the attacks on Zenzinger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>City Councilman Mark McGoff called the current mailers and the 2014 TV ad &quot;outrageous fabrications.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m appalled by that because it besmirches Rachel Zenzinger&#39;s reputation and it&#39;s made out of whole cloth. There&#39;s just nothing there. She didn&#39;t vote to send herself on a junket and she didn&#39;t go on a junket,&quot; McGoff said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just because Zenzinger voted to send a delegation doesn&#39;t mean she &quot;intended to use city funds,&quot; said Edna Gordon, president of Arvada Sister Cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants paid their own way on previous sister city trips, including a 2008 delegation when two councilmembers and the city manager went to Jinzhou (before Zenzinger was on the council), Gordon said. Even the local Arvada Sister Cities group&rsquo;s members paid for their trips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams, the mayor, has a different view of Zenzinger&rsquo;s initial vote in favor of Dyer&rsquo;s motion to &quot;send a delegation to Jinzhou.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Did she support a motion that would have funded through city funds the opportunity for her to go? Yes, she did,&quot; the mayor said. But he stressed that she also made the subsequent successful motion &quot;with the explicit direction that no city funds be used.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My negativity toward their ad is that it implies that she actually took that trip, and she didn&rsquo;t,&quot; Williams said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zenzinger disagrees with the mayor&rsquo;s interpretation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Yes, I voted to approve an &lsquo;official&rsquo; delegation, which meant that an elected official would make the trip,&quot; Zenzinger said in an email. &quot;The funding for the delegation was not addressed until the subsequent vote.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mayor Williams&rsquo; comments about funding, even though they were not relevant to the original motion, prompted me to make a second motion that clarified and distinguished that this delegation would receive no funding from the city,&quot; Zenzinger added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government did not respond to additional requests for comment from PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a political mailer, Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government stated, &quot;While serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer funded junket to China.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of a member of the Arvada City Council, Zenzinger did vote on a failed motion to send an official delegation to a sister-city&nbsp;event in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This hardly supports the political group&rsquo;s accusation. Not only did Zenzinger initiate a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for the delegation to China. She never even went to China!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The attack is a gross distortion of the facts.
