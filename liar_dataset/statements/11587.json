To streamline our analysis, we focused mostly on these four claims -- that in Japan, &quot;permanent residency is not given to Muslims,&quot; the &quot;propagation of Islam&quot; is banned, &quot;one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language,&quot; and &quot;Muslims cannot even rent a house.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HmnySEgpw0G8CzP9UfBe_etRt_2YWdfwrqw_8LcNlQ8oxAhsFmcbDpSaGknU3crEeJpsME3lKrIYJFFAdHh6gISgVa6TAx4dAEt01zE01ddPONYpZ3bLSGJqEk75RdhZGJMP7epe\" style=\"border:none; height:624px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We heard back from three experts who have experience with the intersection of Japan and Islam, and all three said the graphic is blatantly incorrect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The chain email is nothing but malicious falsehood,&quot; said Kumiko Yagi, a professor at the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies Graduate School who has written extensively about Islam and other religions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kamada Shigeru, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Tokyo, agreed, saying that all four of the claims we spotlighted are wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said Japan doesn&rsquo;t discriminate in permanent residency on the basis of religion and that &quot;propagation&quot; of Islam is not banned. He added that the Koran or other religious books in Arabic can be imported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for renting a residence, he said there may be some reluctance among residents of Japan to rent apartments to foreigners as a general rule, but he said there&rsquo;s no specific animus toward Muslims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These four claims &quot;are totally unfounded,&quot; said Glenda S. Roberts, a professor of cultural anthropology and Japanese studies at the graduate school of Asia-Pacific Studies at Waseda University in Tokyo. &quot;It is disturbing that such an email is circulating,&quot; she added. &quot;These claims are simply ridiculous.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other claims in the graphic are easily debunked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, the graphic claims that &quot;Japan is the only country in the world with a negligible number of embassies in Islamic countries.&quot; Yet a quick visit to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs&rsquo; <a href=\"http://www.mofa.go.jp/about/emb_cons/mofaserv.html\">website</a> shows that Japan has embassies in such countries as Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, plus a permanent representative to the Palestinian Authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, there is nothing in <a href=\"http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/information/tnl-01.html\">Japanese nationality law</a> that prevents Muslims from becoming naturalized citizens. The requirements concern length of residency, age, a history of &quot;upright conduct,&quot; the ability to support oneself and a willingness to give up other nationalities. There is no mention of religion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for universities not teaching Arabic, we found that the <a href=\"http://www.tufs.ac.jp/english/education/ug/studies/arabic.html\">Tokyo University of Foreign Studies</a> does. Classes in Arabic are also taught at the <a href=\"http://www.aii-t.org/e/program.htm\">Arabic Islamic Institute in Tokyo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe <a href=\"http://japan.kantei.go.jp/96_abe/actions/201407/16article2.html\">made clear</a> Japan&rsquo;s respect for people of the Islamic faith during an event with the Islamic diplomatic corps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have found that a fundamental aspect of the spirit of Islam is harmony with and love for others,&quot; Abe said. &quot;I believe therein lie points of commonality with the Japanese spirit, which is founded on co-existence.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The graphic says that in Japan, &quot;permanent residency is not given to Muslims,&quot; the &quot;propagation of Islam&quot; is banned, &quot;one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language,&quot; and &quot;Muslims cannot even rent a house.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of these four statements is incorrect, and the overall point of the graphic -- that Japan keeps itself free from radical Islam by discriminating against all Muslims -- is dramatically off-base. We rate these claims Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-17T15:05:35.750050", "ruling_date": "2015-11-17T16:43:56", "ruling_headline": "Viral graphic says Japan keeps out radical Islam through strong restrictions on Muslims", "ruling_headline_slug": "viral-graphic-says-japan-keeps-out-radical-islam-t", "ruling_link_text": "Shareable image fans xenophobia", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Viral graphic, received by PolitiFact Nov. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.mofa.go.jp/about/emb_cons/mofaserv.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Websites of Japanese Embassies, Consulates and Permanent Missions</u></a>,&quot; accessed Nov. 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet, &quot;<a href=\"http://japan.kantei.go.jp/96_abe/actions/201407/16article2.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Prime Minister Hosts the Iftar with the Islamic Diplomatic Corps in Japan</u></a>,&quot; July 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ministry of Justice of Japan, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/information/tnl-01.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Nationality Law</u></a>,&quot; accessed Nov. 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Kumiko Yagi, professor at the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies Graduate School, Nov. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Kamada Shigeru, professor of Islamic studies at the University of Tokyo, Nov. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Glenda S.
