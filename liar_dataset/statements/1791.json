She served on the panel from 2005 to 2008 while she was dean at Harvard Law School. And in 2008, according to <a href=\"http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2607/elen-kagen-financial-disclosure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">financial disclosure forms</a> filed with the Senate committee, she was paid a stipend of $10,000 for her services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to its website, the Global Markets Institute at Goldman Sachs &quot;provides research and high-level advisory services to policymakers, regulators and investors around the world.&quot; Kagan participated for several years in an annual, daylong conference for the company.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;This advisory group was comprised of leaders from various sectors including academia, the media, business, and other industry,&quot; Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler told media outlets that inquired about Kagan&#39;s role with the board. &quot;They met once a year for a daylong conference organized around public policy matters. The group was not involved in making any investment decisions for the company.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAsked about Kagan&#39;s involvement with Goldman Sachs on the day before her nomination, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the panel &quot;had absolutely nothing to do with decisions Goldman is being investigated for.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/07/elena-kagans-goldman-sach_n_568350.html?page=4&amp;show_comment_id=46684085#comment_46684085\" target=\"_blank\">Huffington Post</a> posted two reports the advisory council completed in 2005 and 2008. Among other things, they assess various risks faced by the world economy (and as the HuffPo article notes, they weren&#39;t exactly prescient).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile it certainly doesn&#39;t do any political good to be associated in any way with Goldman Sachs right now, we could find no evidence that Kagan&#39;s role is tied to any alleged wrongdoing at Goldman Sachs. We also think it&#39;s a stretch for some critics to embellish her limited one-day-a-year position into a broad characterization that she &quot;worked for&quot; Goldman Sachs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut that&#39;s not what Savage said. He said Kagan took money from Goldman Sachs, and she did -- at least $10,000 in 2008.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe second part of Savage&#39;s claim -- the &quot;just like her boss, Obama&quot; part -- is a bit of a stretch, though.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nObama has never drawn a paycheck from Goldman Sachs and federal law prohibits corporations from making direct campaign contributions. So neither Obama nor his campaign got any money from Goldman Sachs, the corporate entity. And during the presidential election, his campaign didn&#39;t accept money from federal political action committees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut he did accept considerable campaign contributions from Goldman Sachs employees. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a well-respected nonpartisan group that specializes in analyzing campaign data, Goldman Sachs employees <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00009638\" target=\"_blank\">gave the Obama campaign</a> $994,795. That put Goldman Sachs employees No. 2 on Obama&#39;s top donors list.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut again, getting a check from Goldman Sachs for services rendered (as Kagan did, albeit a small one) is far different than accepting campaign contributions from the company&#39;s employees. By that measure, Obama&#39;s Republican opponent Sen. John <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00006424\" target=\"_blank\">McCain took money</a> from Goldman Sachs too -- $230,000 in campaign contributions from its employees. So we find Savage&#39;s claim to be Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-05-13T18:44:25.669470", "ruling_date": "2010-05-14T16:40:56", "ruling_headline": "Michael Savage says Kagan took money from Goldman Sachs just like her boss, Obama", "ruling_headline_slug": "michael-savage-says-kagan-took-money-goldman-sachs", "ruling_link_text": "Kagan cashed a Goldman check", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Michael Savage website, <a href=\"http://www.michaelsavage.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=11548\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Obama&#39;s Judgmental Non-Judge,&quot;</a> by Michael Savage, May 10, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/kagan0509.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Questionnaire for non-judicial nominees: Elena Kagan</a>, Jan. 15, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, <a href=\"http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2607/elen-kagen-financial-disclosure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Financial disclosure forms submitted by Kagan to be solicitor general</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huffington Post, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/07/elena-kagans-goldman-sach_n_568350.html?page=4&amp;show_comment_id=46684085#comment_46684085\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Elena Kagan&#39;s Goldman Sachs Ties Brought Up Again,&quot;</a> by Sam Stein, May 7, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00009638\" target=\"_blank\">Top Contributors to the Obama presidential campaign</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00006424\" target=\"_blank\">Top Contributors to the McCain presidential campaign</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>USA Today, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/2010-04-26-kagan_N.htm\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Possible Supreme Court pick had ties with Goldman Sachs,&quot;</a> by Matt Kelley, April 27, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goldman Sachs website, <a href=\"http://www2.goldmansachs.com/ideas/global-markets-institute/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Global Markets Institute at Goldman Sachs </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Quarterly Today, &quot;Obama Seeks to Control the Narrative in Battle to Define Kagan,&quot; by Seth Stern, May 10, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Michael", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 413, "last_name": "Savage", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "michael-savage", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/michaelsavage.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/413/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.michaelsavage.wnd.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;She (Kagan) took money from Goldman Sachs just like her boss, Obama.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "his website", "statement_date": "2010-05-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 156, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/156/", "subject": "Kagan Nomination", "subject_slug": "kagan-nomination", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 104, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/104/", "subject": "Pundits", "subject_slug": "pundits", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 108, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/108/", "subject": "Supreme Court", "subject_slug": "supreme-court", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
