The Clinton regulatory agenda will drive up electricity prices for Virginia families and will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s claim about Clinton wanting to shut down natural gas production is not accurate, but what about his claim on the cost of her energy agenda? &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim is misleading as $5 trillion refers to the cost of implementation, not the cost to the economy. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s more, the researcher who produced the figure told us the investment will actually help the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The $5 trillion figure</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump campaign referred us to a 2016 <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3GSXHR8ZL1HM01pQ0d3NmIteUIyN1NObDNhSlZfRzV6ZTk4/view?usp=sharing\">working paper</a> by Columbia Business School professor Geoffrey Heal entitled &quot;What Would it Take to Reduce US Greenhouse Gas Emissions 80% by 2050?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heal, who is <a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/08/California-Climate-Letter-Print-Ad-SB-350-SB-32.pdf\">in favor</a> of climate change action, estimated a cost of $42 billion to $176 billion per year in required investment in production capacity, energy storage, energy transmission and battery-powered vehicles. On the low end, that comes out to $1.3 trillion over three decades and, on the high end, $5.3 trillion over three decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This, however, does not refer to a loss in GDP, but rather the amount needed to update the U.S. energy system and technology infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s not a GDP loss at all,&quot; Heal told PolitiFact. &quot;This is infrastructure investment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He pointed out that Trump and Clinton have both called for long-term infrastructure investment. Spending the $5 trillion on cutting emissions is a &quot;relatively inexpensive way with a good rate of return,&quot; Heal said, and the $5 trillion will have a &quot;multiplier&quot; effect that will help the economy become cleaner and more productive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heal also told us to take his estimate with a grain of salt because there a lot of uncertainties, such as the price of technology. Overall, he actually supports Clinton&rsquo;s &quot;sensible&quot; energy and climate change policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;She&rsquo;s pushing for the right things,&quot; he said. &quot;I certainly don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll bankrupt the country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s not entirely accurate to say 80 percent by 2050 is Clinton&rsquo;s &quot;regulatory agenda.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/climate/\">proposed</a> various energy policies to cut carbon emissions by 30 percent in 2025 relative to 2005 levels. She said her plan will &quot;put the country on a path to cut emissions more than 80 percent by 2050,&quot; a goal established by President Barack Obama and found in this year&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/31/fact-sheet-us-reports-its-2025-emissions-target-unfccc\">Democratic Party Platform.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, the analysis offered by Heal doesn&rsquo;t apply to her actual policies but an aspiration the Democrats share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://deepdecarbonization.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/US_Deep_Decarbonization_Technical_Report_Exec_Summary.pdf\">2014 paper</a> by the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project, which brings together energy researchers from around the world, found a similar result: an investment cost equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the researchers note that this price tag is &quot;incremental&quot; and has a great level of uncertainty &quot;because they depend on assumptions about consumption levels, technology costs, and fossil fuel prices nearly 40 years into the future.&quot; They also stipulate that the cost assumes little to no technological change nor does the estimate include benefits like avoided health and infrastructure costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Economic cost of energy policies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we look at specific policies rather than a 30-year goal, the economic cost of Clinton&rsquo;s energy agenda is dramatically less expensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/trump-outlines-plan-for-american-energy-renaissance\">speech</a> to the Shale Insight conference in Pennsylvania, Trump specified that the $5 trillion refers to the President Barack Obama&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan and Clean Power Plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/image/president27sclimateactionplan.pdf\">Climate Action Plan</a> proposes new regulations, investments in renewable energy and international cooperation to cut carbon emissions. That plan includes the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/clean-power-plan-existing-power-plants\">Clean Power Plan</a> of 2015 (which requires power plants to reduce their 2005 emission levels by 32 percent within 25 years) and the Paris agreement (in which the Obama administration pledged to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Deese44/we-re-taking-action-on-climate-change-and-the-world-is-joining-us-2bf44a62b9b9#.e2l28a6bb\">cut national 2005 emission levels by 28 percent within 20 years</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those plans are currently in limbo. The Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/09/supreme-court-puts-the-brakes-on-the-epas-clean-power-plan/?utm_term=.3733e9985ece\">ruled</a> in February 2016 to halt the Clean Power Plan&rsquo;s implementation while the Paris agreement has <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php\">yet to go into effect. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/climate/\">vowed</a> to defend and implement Obama&rsquo;s climate change policies, including the Clean Power Plan and the Paris climate agreement. Critics of these policies &mdash; namely the oil and gas industry, business groups and free market oriented think tanks &mdash; say they&rsquo;ll impose costs on businesses and consumers alike. But these estimates do not come close to $5 trillion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a 2015 report by the conservative Heritage Foundation &mdash; which opposes the plan &mdash; the Clean Power Plan will lead to a loss of <a href=\"http://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/pdf/BG3025.pdf\">$2.5 trillion in GDP</a> by 2030.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s table breaking down the estimates we found, all from groups that are opposed to the plans or that have concerns about them:</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Group</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Policy</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Estimated cost</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Year of analysis</p>\r\n\t\t\t</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Heritage Foundation</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Clean Power Plan</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$2.5 trillion in GDP by 2030</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2015</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Heritage Foundation</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Climate Action Plan</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/06/climate-policy-economic-impact-and-cost-of-obama-s-climate-action-plan\">$1.47 trillion in national income</a> by 2030</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2013</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Clean Power Plan</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.mapi.net/blog/2016/01/generating-controversy-epas-clean-power-plan\">$660 billion in GDP loss</a> by 230</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2016</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>American Action Forum, a center-right advocacy group</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Paris agreement and existing climate change-oriented regulations</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$562 billion by 2030*</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2015</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>U.S. Chamber of Commerce</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Clean Power Plan</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"http://www.energyxxi.org/sites/default/files/file-tool/Assessing_the_Impact_of_Potential_New_Carbon_Regulations_in_the_United_States.pdf\">$510 billion in GDP loss</a> by 2030</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2014</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>*American Action Forum estimated that altogether, existing climate change-geared regulations cost $28 billion annually while the Paris agreement, which kicks in 2020, would raise that number to <a href=\"https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/previewing-paris-u.s.-to-spend-an-additional-38-to-45-billion-to-meet-2025\">$45 billion annually</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Estimated benefits of climate change policies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the flip side, the Environmental Protection Agency and others argue the Clean Power Plan actually leads to economic gains when health and environmental benefits are included in the analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Curbing carbon emissions would reduce health hazards, such as asthma and heart attacks, associated with particle pollution, saving the public $34 to $54 billion per year by 2030, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/fact-sheet-clean-power-plan-numbers\">according to the EPA</a>. Factoring in the EPA&rsquo;s own projected costs of $8 billion per year, &nbsp;that&rsquo;s an annual net gain of $26 billion to $46 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2016 cost-benefit analysis by Harvard researchers resulted in a figure in the same ballpark: a net <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0156308\">$38 billion per year</a> in net benefits by 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the National Resources Defense Council had even rosier projections. The environmental group estimated that the Clean Power Plan would deliver benefits worth <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/pollution-standards-epa-plan-summary.pdf\">$55 billion to $93 billion</a>, outweighing the costs of $7.3 billion to $8.8 billion. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clinton campaign also pointed us to several papers on the cost of not reducing emissions. For examples, researchers estimated a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v527/n7577/full/nature15725.html\">23 percent reduction</a> in global incomes by 2100 if climate change is unmitigated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Climate change is a serious issue for the economy. It could inflict damages that will add up,&quot; Heal said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said Clinton&rsquo;s energy agenda &quot;will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump campaign said Trump was referring to one study that looked at how much it would cost to reach Clinton&rsquo;s climate goal; it referred to a high-end, 30-year estimate of implementation costs. The study did not actually measure the effects on the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Critics of the plan say it will reduce GDP by as much as $2.5 trillion. Supporters say it actually will have a net-positive effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s statement is not accurate.
