Tom Kean in disbelief when he says the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reports to about 100 congressional committees and subcommittees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKean, the former head of the 9/11 Commission, received the same reaction from radio host Brian Lehrer on Aug. 30 when discussing counter-terrorism efforts as the country approaches the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring the WNYC broadcast from Montclair State University, Lehrer asked Kean about a May 2010 article on NJ.com, in which Kean is quoted as saying &quot;Homeland Security spends way too much of its time reporting to the 100 congressional subcommittees that claim some type of jurisdiction.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLehrer asked Kean, &quot;Is it really a hundred or were you just kind of using an expression?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKean responded: &quot;I wish I was. No, it&rsquo;s about a hundred&hellip;Believe it or not, if you can imagine this, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary) Janet Napolitano and you&rsquo;ve been given a job of running Homeland Security. In other words, protecting all of us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;And all of sudden, you find out you&rsquo;re reporting to a hundred different committees and subcommittees in (the) United States Congress. And you&rsquo;re spending at least a third of your time preparing testimony or testifying, you and your top deputies. That&rsquo;s a third of your time you&rsquo;re not spending protecting us. This is dysfunctional.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat may be dysfunctional, but it&rsquo;s also true. PolitiFact New Jersey discovered Kean was right -- Homeland Security must report to 108 congressional committees and subcommittees, according to the department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBetween Jan. 1 and Aug. 26, Homeland Security officials testified at 120 hearings and provided about 1,809 briefings to congressional offices, according to department records.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNapolitano also has expressed concern with her department&rsquo;s level of congressional oversight.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This often results in our principals and their staff spending more time responding to congressional requests and requirements than executing their mandated homeland security responsibilities,&quot; Napolitano wrote in an April 2010 letter to U.S. Rep. Peter King (R-NY).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe number of congressional eyeballs on Homeland Security operations has been subject to continued criticism in the years since the department was formed. Created slightly more than a year after Sept. 11, Homeland Security combined all or part of 22 different federal departments and agencies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to its July 2004 report, the 9/11 Commission recommended reforming congressional oversight of Homeland Security, which was then answering to 88 committees and subcommittees. A few months later, a report from a group of former legislators and other individuals noted that oversight of the U.S. Department of Defense was much different.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In comparison, the Department of Defense, with a budget that is more than ten times greater than DHS, reports to only 36 committees and subcommittees in the House and the Senate,&quot; according to that December 2004 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies and Business Executives for National Security.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFollowing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and another federal panel, Congress took &quot;a few incremental steps,&quot; such as forming the House Homeland Security Committee, according to a December 2008 report from the Commission on the Prevention of WMD Proliferation and Terrorism.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that report said &quot;the creation of these new committees (and subcommittees) did nothing to streamline the number of congressional panels to which DHS must respond.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMore criticism of Homeland Security&rsquo;s oversight came as recently as last week, when Kean and other members of the Bipartisan Policy Center&rsquo;s National Security Preparedness Group -- a follow-up to the 9/11 Commission -- issued a &quot;report card&quot; on the status of the 9/11 Commission&rsquo;s recommendations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat report card said &quot;too many committees have concurrent and overlapping jurisdiction. This is a recipe for confusion.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKing, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, pledged in a Sept. 1 press release to continue working with House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and other House leaders to reform congressional oversight of Homeland Security.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs unbelievable as it may sound to his listeners, Kean accurately states that Homeland Security answers to about 100 congressional committees and subcommittees. It&rsquo;s a level of oversight that has attracted the criticism of various entities and the Homeland Security Secretary herself.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/09/politifact_homeland_security_d.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-09-02T18:04:01.291540", "ruling_date": "2011-09-08T05:15:00", "ruling_headline": "Former New Jersey Gov.
