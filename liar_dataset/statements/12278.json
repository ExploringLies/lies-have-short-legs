He said in a Fox News report on Syrian refugees (as shown in <a href=\"http://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=video&amp;id=943\">a video</a> is on Cruz&rsquo;s own Senate web page):</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have welcomed refugees &mdash; the tired, huddled masses &mdash; for centuries. That&rsquo;s been the history of the United States. We should continue to do so.&quot; He added: &quot;We have to continue to be vigilant to make sure those coming are not affiliated with the terrorists, but we can do that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fact Checker found in reviewing other Cruz statements in 2014 that he was not a particularly vocal advocate for accepting more refugees, but he supported the idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, <a href=\"https://www.tedcruz.org/news/cruz-condemns-the-isis-terrorist-attack-on-paris/\">Cruz changed course</a>, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/260317-cruz-to-offer-bill-banning-syrian-refugees\">seeking to ban</a> Syrian refugees who are Muslim from entering the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wanted to &lsquo;give amnesty to illegal immigrants&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some consider <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/07/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-most-gop-candidates-have-supported-amnest/\">amnesty</a> to be anything less than deporting all illegal immigrants, while others think of amnesty as letting immigrants stay with no punishment or additional requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the Fact Checker and FactCheck.org found it impossible to sort out Cruz&rsquo;s position on the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill from the so-called Gang of Eight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FactCheck.org <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2015/12/did-cruz-support-legalization/\">noted</a> that one Cruz amendment to the bill would have stripped out a proposal for a path to citizenship for those currently in the country illegally -- but, purposefully, also left intact provisions to provide legal status for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the Fact Checker pointed out that Cruz introduced five amendments to the bill, including one that expanded legal immigration, and gave passionate speeches in support of his amendments. Cruz now contends his amendments were meant as a &quot;poison pill&quot; to kill the bill, which ultimately fell apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as the Fact Checker observed, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/12/18/ted-cruzs-claim-that-he-has-never-supported-legalization-of-undocumented-immigrants/?tid=a_inl\">there&rsquo;s no way to prove</a> which version of the story is the truth; what we can say is that Cruz was being disingenuous then or disingenuous now.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for now, Cruz is adamantly <a href=\"https://www.tedcruz.org/cruz-immigration-plan/\">against amnesty</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Great America PAC says Cruz &quot;wanted to let in more Syrian refugees and give amnesty to illegal immigrants.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz in 2014 supported continuing to allow Syrian refugees into the United States and in 2013, he appeared to back measures to give legal status to illegal immigrants.
