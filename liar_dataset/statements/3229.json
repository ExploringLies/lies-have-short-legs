In response, we started two long, bloody wars and built a vast homeland-security apparatus -- all at a cost of trillions! Now consider this. During those same nine years, 270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home. Our response? We weakened our gun laws.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt that point, a whirring sound comes from off-panel. In the final panel, we see that his guest is a space alien, who says, &quot;Fail. Cannot Comprehend.&quot; To which Slackmeyer cracks, &quot;Well, you may be a little jet-lagged.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA reader asked us to fact-check it. So we&rsquo;ll look at whether since Sept. 11, 2001, &quot;270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe began by contacting Garry Trudeau, the cartoonist who has drawn Doonesbury for more than four decades. He got back immediately with a summary of his methodology.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The final figure lacks precision, because it&#39;s extrapolated,&quot; Trudeau wrote us, noting, correctly, that the most recent data for gun deaths from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is from 2007.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;What I had were six years -- 2002-2007 -- of a remarkably stable number, around 30,000&quot; gun deaths per year, Trudeau wrote. &quot;So in my judgment, multiplying 30,000 times nine yielded a figure reasonable and accurate enough for rhetorical purposes without using hyperbole. If anything, it may be slightly on the low side.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe found that Trudeau was basically right. We went to the same CDC database he used -- the <a href=\"http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/mortrate10_sy.html\">Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System</a> (or WISQARS for short) -- and got virtually identical numbers. Our number came out slightly higher -- 281,757 -- because we not only extrapolated out through the end of 2010 in our calculations but also included the final three months of 2001.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe should note the details of Trudeau&rsquo;s definition of gun deaths, which is also the definition we would have used if we&rsquo;d been starting from scratch. It includes the following categories:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Suicides: 102,002 between 2002 and 2007<br />\r\n\t&bull; Homicides: 73,148 between 2002 and 2007<br />\r\n\t&bull; Accidental: 4,185 between 2002 and 2007<br />\r\n\t&bull; Legal shootings: 1,999 between 2002 and 2007<br />\r\n\t&bull; Undetermined: 1,427 between 2002 and 2007<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t-- Total: 182,761 between 2002 and 2007<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo on the numbers, Trudeau&rsquo;s methodology was accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe only thing that threw us was how the strip had described where the deaths occurred -- &quot;270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire <em>at home</em>&quot; (our emphasis).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInitially, we took that to mean that 270,000 Americans were literally killed in or near their homes. And we knew that couldn&rsquo;t be right, because the number both we and Trudeau calculated included all gunfire deaths, wherever they had occurred.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked criminologists for guidance on what percentage of gun deaths occur at home, they said the statistics on that question are scattershot. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, provided data on Chicago homicides from an <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/08-1521_amicus-Criminal-Justice-Profs.pdf\">amicus brief</a> he wrote for a Supreme Court case. Since 1965, the ratio of outside-the-home handgun homicides in Chicago to those occurring at home has tended to bounce around from about two-to-one in the 1970s to about five-to-one in the 1990s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo if one interprets &quot;at home&quot; to mean in or near someone&rsquo;s home, the numbers Trudeau calculated wouldn&rsquo;t be correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we raised this point with Trudeau, he said that wasn&rsquo;t what he meant: &quot;I didn&#39;t say &lsquo;in the home,&rsquo; I said &lsquo;at home&rsquo; as opposed to abroad, where the wars are. Failure to communicate clearly, I guess. Rats.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReading through it again, we think Trudeau&rsquo;s explanation sounds reasonable. But we decided to mark Trudeau down slightly because we think it&rsquo;s also reasonable for people to make the same initial assumption we did, that &quot;at home&quot; means in or near one&rsquo;s home. So we&rsquo;ll rate the comment Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-14T13:03:07.918478", "ruling_date": "2011-02-14T15:41:08", "ruling_headline": "Doonesbury strip says 270,000 Americans have been killed by guns since 9/11", "ruling_headline_slug": "doonesbury-strip-says-270000-americans-have-been-k", "ruling_link_text": "Just about right, if homicides, suicides and accidents are counted", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tDoonesbury, <a href=\"http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/archive/2011/02/13\">comic strip</a>, Feb. 13, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href=\"http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/mortrate10_sy.html\">main search </a><a href=\"http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/mortrate10_sy.html\">page</a> for Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS), accessed Feb. 14, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProfessors of criminal justice <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/08-1521_amicus-Criminal-Justice-Profs.pdf\">amicus </a><a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/08-1521_amicus-Criminal-Justice-Profs.pdf\">brief</a> in McDonald v.
