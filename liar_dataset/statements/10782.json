The judge was&nbsp;told that Chiles cooperated in an unrelated homicide case that stemmed from an argument during a dice game, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/suspect-sought-in-double-slaying-is-felon-on-supervision-b99482300z1-300012711.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>reported</u></a>. The way a prosecutor put it, Chiles testified at the trial of &quot;a more dangerous offender&quot; and that man was convicted of first-degree reckless homicide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Time incarcerated: </strong>Chiles was credited for the time he spent in jail while his case was pending, which is common. So, of his two years behind bars, he served six months in jail and a year and a half in prison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Extended supervision:</strong> Chiles was <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/suspect-sought-in-double-slaying-is-felon-on-supervision-b99482300z1-300012711.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>released</u></a> from prison in August 2013 and was due to remain on extended supervision until August 2015. That meant he still had about four months to serve at the time of his death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clarke&rsquo;s position</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Clarke&rsquo;s claim, let&rsquo;s note that when people talk about sentencing in a felony case, they usually think about the time an offender is being sent to prison. But technically, the sentence includes both time in prison plus time on extended supervision after the offender is released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke&rsquo;s spokeswoman, Fran McLaughlin, told us the sheriff meant to say Chiles <em>could have</em> gotten a 13-year sentence. But she acknowledged the total maximum sentence was actually 15 years -- 10 years in prison, plus five years of extended supervision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McLaughlin said Clarke&rsquo;s point was that Chiles could have received a 15-year sentence but he served only two years in prison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Clarke&rsquo;s claim ignores the fact that Chiles would not have been given the maximum sentence, since he had been a cooperating witness in a homicide and a recommendation for a lesser sentence was part of the plea agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke said the man who killed a motorist who fatally struck a 2-year-old was &quot;back on the street&quot; because he had received a 13-year sentence for bank robbery but only &quot;served two years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chiles&rsquo; sentence was four years, not 13. Chiles did spend two years behind bars, as Clarke indicated, but he was also sentenced to two years of extended supervision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-04-30T11:36:09.326050", "ruling_date": "2015-04-30T11:38:15", "ruling_headline": "Killer was on street after serving 2 years of 13-year robbery sentence, Sheriff David Clarke says", "ruling_headline_slug": "killer-was-street-after-serving-2-years-13-year-ro", "ruling_link_text": "Total sentence was 4 years, not 13", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WISN-TV, &quot;Upfront with Mike Gousha&quot; <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/politics/upfront/clarke-judiciary-is-weak-link/32570928\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview</u></a> of Milwaukee County Sheriff David A.
