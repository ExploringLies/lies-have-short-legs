Reforms similar to those made in Wisconsin were <a href=\"http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2011/09/thompson-announ.php\">later adopted</a> at the federal level under President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, who had previously <a href=\"http://www.governing.com/topics/mgmt/Taking-Stock.html\">made welfare changes</a> as governor of Arkansas.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut reforming welfare isn&rsquo;t the same as ending it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs Thompson tries to burnish his conservative credentials against two other candidates for the GOP nomination in 2012, let&rsquo;s step back in time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBefore becoming President George W. Bush&rsquo;s health and human services secretary in 2001, Thompson served for 14 years as Wisconsin&rsquo;s governor. One of his signature accomplishments was <a href=\"http://dcf.wi.gov/w2/wisworks.htm\">&quot;Wisconsin Works -- W2,&quot;</a> a measure he signed in to law in 1996.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson&rsquo;s Senate campaign spokesman, <a href=\"http://www.persuasionpartners.com/darrin.html\">Darrin Schmitz</a>, cited W-2 as the primary evidence to back Thompson&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA <a href=\"http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/tp&amp;CISOPTR=49223&amp;CISOSHOW=49207\">booklet</a> on W-2 produced by the Thompson administration at the time hailed the law as &quot;the end of welfare,&quot; saying it eliminated &quot;automatic welfare checks&quot; provided by the <a href=\"http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/afdc/baseline/1history.pdf\">Aid to Families with Dependent Children</a> program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor decades, AFDC&rsquo;s cash entitlement to low-income families, which sometimes lasted for many years, was synonymous with &quot;welfare&quot; in America.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAFDC included virtually no work requirements, but W-2 not only requires recipients to work, or engage in work-related activity such as training, it puts a five-year limit on how long they can be in the program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are several types of W-2 assistance. Some recipients, for example, work in private-sector &quot;trial jobs&quot; that pay at least minimum wage and are intended to become permanent, while others earn up to $673 per month working in community service jobs. In October 2011, the number of people in W-2, which is budgeted <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/Informational-Papers/Documents/2011/46_W-2%20and%20other%20economic%20support%20programs.pdf\">to cost $626 million</a> in state and federal funds in 2010-2011, was <a href=\"http://dcf.wisconsin.gov/researchandstatistics/rsdata/pdf/critindicators2011_10.pdf\">nearly 16,000</a> -- up 15 percent from a year earlier.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Thompson replaced the AFDC entitlement with the work-required W-2 -- but does that mean he ended welfare, period?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe definition of welfare is key.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson &quot;had a leading role in ending welfare as we previously knew it,&quot; said <a href=\"http://www.wccf.org/about_staff.php\">Jon Peacock</a>, research director of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a liberal think tank. &quot;Whether he eliminated welfare altogether is a matter of semantics. &nbsp;If by welfare, one means an entitlement program that doesn&rsquo;t require work, then I think one can say that (Thompson) played a leading role in the effort to eliminate welfare. &nbsp;If one uses a more expansive definition, equating welfare with public assistance generally or with any form of cash assistance, then it&rsquo;s not accurate to say it was eliminated.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew York University professor of politics <a href=\"http://politics.as.nyu.edu/object/LawrenceMMead\">Lawrence Mead</a>, who has done a number of studies on W-2, agreed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If welfare means the old system, then he&rsquo;s right, he did indeed abolish it,&quot; Mead said of Thompson, noting Wisconsin was the first state to create an &quot;all-work-based&quot; aid system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut &quot;it&rsquo;s not true in a more literal sense,&quot; Mead said, because other forms of welfare -- such as food stamps -- still exist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor instance, in October 2011, <a href=\"http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/foodshare/pdf/ataglance/2011/Ataglance201110.pdf\">more than 800,000</a> low-income Wisconsin adults and children participated in <a href=\"http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/foodshare/\">FoodShare</a>, Wisconsin&rsquo;s version of what used to be known as the food stamps program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMoreover, despite its strict work requirements, W-2 arguably has its own welfare components. For example, the custodial parent of an infant who is 12 weeks old or less <a href=\"http://dcf.wi.gov/w2/wisworks.htm\">receives</a> $673 per month and is not required to work. That is, to be sure, a small group and a limited time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson declared that as governor, &quot;we ended welfare.&quot; His W-2 program didn&rsquo;t eliminate every program that might be considered a handout. But it did end the entitlement program most commonly known as welfare, replacing it with one that requires nearly all recipients to work for their benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Thompson&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-12-08T12:21:53.034174", "ruling_date": "2011-12-11T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Did GOP U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson end welfare in Wisconsin?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-gop-us-senate-candidate-tommy-thompson-end-wel", "ruling_link_text": "Not quite all of it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<div>\r\n\tTommy Thompson Senate candidacy announcement <a href=\"http://www.620wtmj.com/blogs/charliesykes/134794278.html\">video</a>, Dec. 1, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Tommy Thompson campaign spokesman <a href=\"http://www.persuasionpartners.com/darrin.html\">Darrin Schmitz</a>, Dec. 5, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Wisconsin Department of Health Services spokeswoman Stephanie Smiley, Dec. 6, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Wisconsin Department of Children and Family Services spokeswoman Sara Buschman, Dec. 7, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact.com, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/jun/01/tommy-thompson/thompson-was-a-leader-in-welfare-reform/\">&quot;Thompson was a leader in welfare reform,&quot;</a> June 1, 2007<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTommy Thompson for President 2008 <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2263552358\">Facebook page</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew York University professor of politics <a href=\"http://politics.as.nyu.edu/object/LawrenceMMead\">Lawrence Mead</a>,<a href=\"http://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/dps/pdfs/dp118499.pdf\">&quot;Statecraft: The politics of welfare reform in Wisconsin,&quot;</a> February 1999<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, New York University professor of politics <a href=\"http://politics.as.nyu.edu/object/LawrenceMMead\">Lawrence Mead</a>, Dec. 6, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Historical Society, <a href=\"http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/tp&amp;CISOPTR=49223&amp;CISOSHOW=49207\">&quot;W-2 -- Wisconsin Works&quot;</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Historical Society, <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-060/?action=more_essay\">&quot;Tommy Thompson and the conservative revolution&quot;</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Department of Health Services, <a href=\"http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/foodshare/pdf/ataglance/2011/Ataglance201110.pdf\">&quot;FoodShare Wisconsin program at a glance -- October 2011&quot;</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Department of Children and Family Services, <a href=\"http://dcf.wisconsin.gov/researchandstatistics/rsdata/pdf/critindicators2011_10.pdf\">&quot;Wisconsin Works (W-2) critical indicators,&quot;</a> October 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, <a href=\"http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/afdc/baseline/1history.pdf\">&quot;A brief history of the AFDC program&quot;</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview and email interview, Wisconsin Council on Children and Families research director <a href=\"http://www.wccf.org/about_staff.php\">Jon Peacock</a>, Dec. 5 and 6, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Journal, <a href=\"http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2011/09/thompson-announ.php\">&quot;Thompson announces Senate plans,&quot;</a> Sept. 19, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGoverning, <a href=\"http://www.governing.com/topics/mgmt/Taking-Stock.html\">&quot;Taking stock,&quot;</a> February 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/Informational-Papers/Documents/2011/46_W-2%20and%20other%20economic%20support%20programs.pdf\">&quot;Wisconsin Works (W-2) and other economic support programs,&quot;</a> January 2011</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "Tommy", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 14, "last_name": "Thompson", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "tommy-thompson", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-tommythompson.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/14/", "total_count": 29, "true_count": 3, "website": "https://www.tommyforwisconsin.com/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=2&gclid=CPiG95D88qwCFUJjTAodElamlg"}, "statement": "<div style=\"background-color: transparent;
