The son of a popular Democratic congresswoman  and a longtime party loyalist, Meek has run unopposed in every general  election since his foray into national politics in 2002. <br /><br />When  the Miami congressman aimed his ambition toward Florida's U.S. Senate  seat, the forecast was an easy primary win. Then along came Jeff Greene,  a real estate investor and Palm Beach billionaire whose TV ad blitz  helped carry him into a two-way tie with Meek only weeks after he  entered the race in April.<br /><br />Now Meek's hopes seem  pinned to exposing Greene's former Republican flirtation while  broadcasting his own Democratic lineage. In a June 22, 2010, <em>Palm Beach  Post</em> debate, Meek painted himself as the principal defender of public  education, the middle class and legal abortions.<br /><br />\"When  I become the nominee, the Democratic nominee, I will be the only  pro-choice candidate on the ballot,\" he said.<br /><br />If  Meek makes it to the general election, would he be the only <em>Roe v. Wade</em> defender in the race? We decided to check it out.<br /><br />Florida  has 22 candidates for U.S. Senate. Of those, seven are write-in  candidates who won't appear on the ballot.<br /><br />In the  Democratic primary, the 4-person field is expected to come down to Meek  and Greene, who also supports <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. \"I believe that abortion  should be safe, legal and rare,\" reads his campaign website.<br /><br /> But  Meek's statement envisions a November scenario where he is the  Democratic candidate. So, while Greene&rsquo;s stance provides useful context,  it isn&rsquo;t relevant to our ruling.  <br /><br /> Of the three  Republican candidates, former House Speaker Marco Rubio is expected to  secure his party&rsquo;s nomination. Rubio is fiercely anti-abortion. He  boasts on his campaign website: \"As a state legislator, I supported  various pieces of pro-life legislation that, among other things, would  require doctors to perform ultrasounds before performing abortions and  another bill that would ban the use of taxpayer dollars to fund stem  cell research.\"<br /><br /> There are also six candidates running as  independents and two third-party candidates:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Lewis  Jerome Armstrong, a contractor from Jacksonville, said he was pro-life,  but would support abortion in situations involving incest or rape.</li>\r\n<li>Sue  Askeland, a housewife from Stuart, said she was against all abortions.</li>\r\n<li>Bobbie  Bean, a farmer and printer from Sebring, said he would only support  abortions in situations involving incest, rape or life-threatening  pregnancies.</li>\r\n<li>Bernie DeCastro, the Constitution Party of Florida  candidate from Ocala, supports a federal law that would define  life as beginning at conception, said spokesman Donald Barber.</li>\r\n<li>Bruce Ray Riggs of Crystal River  didn&rsquo;t return our call.</li>\r\n<li>Libertarian Alexander Snitker, an office  supplies salesman from Spring Hill, identified himself as pro-life. He said  abortion should be a state issue, but added he wouldn't vote to  undermine <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. \"Government shouldn't decide for someone else,\"  he said.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Then there is Gov. Charlie  Crist, easily the best known independent candidate. His abortion views  are a tad complicated. Crist, who left the Republican party in April  2010 to secure his position on the general election ballot as an  independent, has maintained a flexible abortion stance during his  political career. He called himself \"pro-choice\" in 1998, then recast  himself as an anti-abortion candidate in his gubernatorial bid. In his  latest political rebirth, Crist insisted he was still personally  pro-life, but would not legislate according to his views. In June 2010,  he rejected a controversial abortion bill that would have required most  women seeking an abortion to view an ultrasound and listen to a doctor  describe the fetus unless they signed a form to opt out. The bill was  described as the most significant anti-abortion measure in Florida  history by proponents.<br /><br />Campaign spokesman Nick  Autiello said Tuesday that Crist is personally pro-life, but accepts  that abortion is legal. That's not a rousing pro-choice endorsement.<br /><br />Meek&rsquo;s  campaign insisted that Crist&rsquo;s gelatin-like abortion record does not  amount to a substantial pro-choice stance.<br /><br />\"On  Charlie Crist, it is almost impossible to PolitiFact him because he  doesn&rsquo;t hold a position,\" said Adam Sharon, Meek&rsquo;s spokesman.<br /><br />To  highlight Meek's credentials, his campaign pointed to an early  endorsement from the NARAL (National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League) Pro-Choice&rsquo;s political action committee.<br /><br />\"He brings a distinguished record of support for a woman's  right to choose to this race. Without question, voters in Florida will  have a clear choice, regardless of which anti-choice candidate Meek  faces in the general election,\" said the organization's president, Nancy  Keenan, in a press release.</p>\r\n<p>However, Keenan also  sent out a press release praising Crist after he vetoed the abortion  bill. The press release called the veto, \"a victory for Florida women,\"  and gave credit to both Crist and Meek for triumphing over the  Republican-led effort. <br /><br />Let&rsquo;s review. If Meek  were to trump Greene in the primary, he would undoubtedly be the most  passionate pro-choice candidate on the general election ballot. That  seems to be the point he wanted to make.<br /><br />But, that's  not what he said. He said he would be the only pro-choice candidate, and  that statement needs some clarification. While Crist may not harbor the  sharpest pro-choice views, he still has taken a seat in that tent both  in recent days and in the past. <br /><br />Given Meek's  solid pro-abortion stance and Crist's rotating views, we rule Meek&rsquo;s  statement Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-22T19:00:16.574197", "ruling_date": "2010-06-22T19:46:42", "ruling_headline": "Meek's pro-choice stance stands out", "ruling_headline_slug": "meeks-pro-choice-stance-stands-out", "ruling_link_text": "Meek stands out on abortion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Palm Beach Post, \"<a href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/special/topics/Senate_democratic_debate\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Palm Beach Hosts Debate Between Democratic Senate  Rivals Jeff Greene and Kendrick Meek,\">The Palm Beach Hosts Debate  Between Democratic Senate Rivals Jeff Greene and Kendrick Meek,</a>\"  June 22, 2010.</p>\r\n<p>NARAL press release, <a href=\"http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/elections/election-pr/pr12162009_meekendorse.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC Endorses Rep.
