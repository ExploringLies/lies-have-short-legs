Half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland. And tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China.</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSounds like a scandal and an outrage. Is that what happened?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor this fact-check, we&rsquo;re focusing on whether &quot;tax credits&quot; that &quot;went overseas&quot; included &quot;$1.2 billion to a solar company that&#39;s building a plant in Mexico.&quot; (In other fact-checks, we found the Finland claim&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/03/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-jobs-finland/\">False</a>, and the&nbsp;China&nbsp;claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/03/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-streetlights-c/\">Mostly False</a>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad listed two sources for its Mexico claim, the <a href=\"https://lpo.energy.gov/?p=5314\">Energy Department</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/sunpower-to-open-mexican-plant_100003821/8/\">PV Magazine</a>. We tracked those down, then chatted with the companies involved.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Two programs, two projects</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll start with what&rsquo;s true: An American solar company, SunPower, was <a href=\"https://lpo.energy.gov/?p=5314\">approved for federal stimulus money</a>. It also <a href=\"https://lpo.energy.gov/?p=5314\">opened a solar panel plant</a> in Mexico.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Or, rather, it moved its Mexican manufacturing from Chihuahua to a building it&rsquo;s leasing in Mexicali, said company spokeswoman Natalie Wymer.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s where the claim&rsquo;s relationship to the truth ends.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; The company didn&rsquo;t get tax credits, but a $1.2 billion <a href=\"https://lpo.energy.gov/?p=5314\">loan guarantee</a>. What&rsquo;s the difference? The Energy Department expects the loan to be paid back &mdash; with interest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; That loan guarantee wasn&rsquo;t for the Mexico plant &mdash; a <a href=\"http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/sunpower-to-open-mexican-plant_100003821/8/\">separate project</a> with its own funding &mdash; but to build the <a href=\"http://www.californiavalleysolarranch.com/\">California Valley Solar Ranch</a> in San Luis Obispo, Calif. Construction on the California project has already started, with the Energy Department projecting <a href=\"https://lpo.energy.gov/?projects=sunpower-corporation-systems-california-valley-solar-ranch\">350 construction jobs</a> and 15 permanent ones. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., the state&rsquo;s largest utility, will ultimately buy the power.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Most of the solar panels for the California project will come from SunPower&rsquo;s California manufacturing facility in Milpitas, though given the size of the project, they&rsquo;ll also come from the company&rsquo;s plants in Mexico and Asia, Wymer said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; SunPower no longer owns the California Valley Solar Ranch project. The solar project &mdash; and the loan guarantee &mdash; <a href=\"http://us.sunpowercorp.com/about/newsroom/press-releases/?relID=83434\">belong to New Jersey company NRG Energy</a>. That&rsquo;s the company that will <a href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=121544&amp;p=irol-SECText&amp;TEXT=aHR0cDovL2lyLmludC53ZXN0bGF3YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2RvY3VtZW50L3YxLzAwMDE0NDUzMDUtMTItMDAwNDkzL3htbA%3d%3d\">get the federal loan money</a>, and be responsible for repaying taxpayers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA TV ad from Americans for Prosperity says billions of tax dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. It claims that stimulus bill tax credits went overseas, such as &quot;$1.2 billion to a solar company that&#39;s building a plant in Mexico.&quot; The ad even cites sources for its claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut those same sources, plus a few phone calls, quickly bring down the ad&rsquo;s house of cards. Sure, taxpayer money was originally approved for a California solar company that also happened to open a plant in Mexico. But that loan &mdash; not tax credits, as the ad claims &mdash; will go to a New Jersey company for a solar project in California, employing construction workers in the state, using mostly California-built solar panels, to create solar power that&rsquo;ll be purchased by a California utility.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a completely different story. The ad strings together alarming-sounding tidbits about actual stimulus projects to create the impression of something else entirely &mdash; in a way that&rsquo;s ultimately ridiculous. And that earns our lowest rating, Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-02T10:12:42.458553", "ruling_date": "2012-05-02T11:31:30", "ruling_headline": "Ad says stimulus tax credits funded a solar company building a Mexico plant", "ruling_headline_slug": "ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-solar-company-", "ruling_link_text": "Nope \u2014 try loan for project in California", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAmericans for Prosperity, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=lUQdP6y0ArM\">AFP Wasteful Spending Ad</a>,&quot;
