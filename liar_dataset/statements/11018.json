Ted Cruz, R-Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cruz, who is running for president, is an outspoken critic of the court&rsquo;s 5-4 ruling in <em>Obergefell v. Hodges </em>that overturned the country&rsquo;s remaining same-sex marriage bans. In an interview on <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=418398912\"><em>Morning Edition</em>&nbsp;June 29</a>, NPR&rsquo;s Steve Inskeep talked with Cruz about how he and other Republicans will respond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;The concern of conservatives seems to be that the court was following public opinion,&quot; Inskeep said. &quot;Same-sex marriage, for example, is much more popular than it used to be.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cruz responded, &quot;Well, Steve, let me actually disagree with your premise. The court doesn&#39;t follow public opinion. The court&rsquo;s views are radically out of step with public opinion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;If the values had changed so much, there would be no need for the court to act because people would have acted democratically to change their marriage laws,&quot; Cruz added. &quot;That hadn&#39;t happened, which is why the court stepped in and (threw) out the laws that the people did adopt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Given the swelling support for same-sex marriage in recent years, we wanted to dig into Cruz&rsquo;s claim that &quot;the court&rsquo;s views are radically out of step with public opinion.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To be clear: The claim could be interpreted as speaking about the court&rsquo;s decisions generally. But given the context of the statement and our interaction with Cruz&rsquo;s campaign, it seems he was talking about same-sex marriage specifically, so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll focus on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There&rsquo;s a couple of different ways to look at this, but Cruz&rsquo;s characterization is an exaggeration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A look at the polls</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On whether the American public supports same-sex marriage, there is no question. <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/civil.htm\">Numerous 2015 polls</a> have found that a majority of the country -- around 60 percent -- favors same-sex marriage. The majority holds in <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-america/newsdesk/gay-marriage-polling-shows-american-support-across-demographic-groups-20150527\">most demographic groups</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Support for same-sex marriage has risen dramatically in the past few years, as demonstrated by this <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/183272/record-high-americans-support-sex-marriage.aspx\">Gallup</a> chart, spanning 20 years:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img height=\"275px;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Qu080-8ImdjlrOdNssGIDFEVIq_eOqHGGJduvnAxwtl6ht8qhraBJGBFhPiUSD32mpv02fekbB0bdznvyfQRMtcWuPdg_sQ0hQW-XUtGNo1yzB3_zaGK8S7neZK_6XxL-2oU5Bo\" style=\"border:none;\" width=\"541px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But there&rsquo;s another question that doesn&rsquo;t have a clear answer -- whether Americans think the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should have been left to the states, rather than having a decision made at the national level. This is essentially the question presented to the Supreme Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips said &quot;it is incontrovertible that a majority of Americans believe that the decision should be left to the states,&quot; pointing to a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/256340440?access_key=key-BrewSjGBCblTYVKI88UN&amp;allow_share=true&amp;escape=false&amp;view_mode=scroll\">February 2015 CBS News poll</a> that found 56 percent of Americans hold this position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, other polls show the opposite: that a majority of Americans think same-sex marriage should be decided nationally. A June 2015 poll by CBS News and the<em> </em><em>New York Times</em> found that just 41 percent of Americans think this is a state issue, while 54 percent think there should be a single federal law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Looking through <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/civil.htm\">a collection</a> of the latest polls on gay rights, neither side stands out as the obvious position of the American public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Given the mix of polling results on this question, &quot;it&#39;s not the case that the court&#39;s ruling was, as Cruz claimed, &lsquo;radically out of step with public opinion.&rsquo; Rather, Americans were less definitive on this aspect of the gay marriage issue than others,&quot; said New York University professor Patrick Egan, who studies public opinion and gay rights issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Phillips noted that a majority of <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2015/06/26/same-sex-marriage-state-by-state/\">states</a> had laws banning same-sex marriage prior to this year&rsquo;s Supreme Court and earlier lower court decisions -- more than 30 state bans in 2013, before the rulings started to roll out. Because state legislatures or the voters directly passed these laws, Phillips said they &quot;reflected the popular will of the people in those states.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But timing is important here. These same-sex marriage bans might have reflected popular opinion at the time they were passed -- nearly all came about before 2010 -- but public opinion on gay marriage has changed significantly since then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;If public opinion is changing -- and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/weekinreview/22gay.html\">the data show it was</a> -- it is possible for both the original legislative decisions and the subsequent court decisions to be consistent with public opinion,&quot; said Peter Enns, a professor of government at Cornell University who studies public opinion and government response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By 2014, at least 50 percent of residents in 32 states supported same-sex marriage -- including quite a few states that had gay marriage bans prior to court decisions, according to the <a href=\"https://ava.publicreligion.org/#lgbt/2014/States/lgbt_ssm/2\">Public Religion Research Institute</a>. A majority opposed same-sex marriage in only eight states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, most political scientists would say public opinion is best measured via representative surveys, not by the laws currently in place,&nbsp;Egan noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So it&rsquo;s not always fair to say that an existing same-sex marriage ban shows that the people of that state are currently opposed to same-sex marriage legalization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cruz said the Supreme Court&rsquo;s views &quot;are radically out of step with public opinion&quot; regarding its decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most polls say around 60 percent favor same-sex marriage -- a high point. At the state level, the majority holds in most cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cruz&rsquo;s staff said that Americans think legalizing same-sex marriage should be&nbsp;a state responsibility rather than something decided at the federal level. But different polls show different results on that point. There isn&rsquo;t an obvious majority one way or the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Certainly there is a good chunk of the population that opposes the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision, but it&rsquo;s definitely not a clear majority.
