Charlie Crist reminded listeners in a televised debate  Sunday that Ronald Reagan was once a Democrat.<br /><br />The line turned up  in a three-way chatter between<em> FOX News Sunday</em> moderator Chris Wallace  and the two Republican U.S. Senate candidates, in which Wallace asked  the governor whether he would support rival Marco Rubio or run as an  independent -- if he lost the GOP primary. For the record, Crist said  he&rsquo;d support the GOP nominee and that he wouldn&rsquo;t run as an unaffiliated  candidate.<br /><br />Here is an excerpt:<br /><br /> <em>WALLACE: Well, I'm going  to get -- I'm going to -- I'll give you an opportunity for a final  statement. I just want to say, though, you are saying you are going to  run in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. You will not run on  the no party affiliation line.<br /><br />CRIST: That's right. That's right.  That's what I'm saying. <br /><br />RUBIO: Chris, if I may, the governor  likes to call himself a Reagan Republican. I don't ever recall Reagan  being questioned about running as an independent. But Ronald Reagan  asked a very important question--<br /><br />CRIST: Actually, Reagan was a  Democrat before he was a Republican. </em></p>\r\n<p>We wanted to find out whether  the late Republican icon Ronald Reagan was actually a registered Democrat, or  whether he was an ideological one.<br /><br />We turned to the Ronald Reagan  Presidential Foundation &amp; Library, in Simi Valley, Calif. The  library's Web site notes Reagan registered as a Republican in the fall  of 1962, after stumping for Richard Nixon as a Democrat. <br /><br />It  tells the story of Reagan making a speech at a Democrats for Nixon event  and being interrupted and asked if he had registered as a Republican.  He responded no. That's when \"down the center aisle through the audience  came a woman who declared I'm a registrar and placed a registration  card in front of him. In front of his audience, Ronald Reagan officially  joined the Republican Party,'' according to Web site.<br /><br />Melissa  Giller, director of communications and programs at the Reagan library,  explained more in an e-mail to PolitiFact Florida.<br /><br />\"Yes, this is  true. He switched to Republican in 1962,'' Giller wrote, noting a quote  in which Reagan complained, \"I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The  party left me.''<br /><br />Giller said Reagan endorsed the presidential  candidacies of Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 as well as that of  Nixon in 1960 \"while remaining a Democrat.\"<br /><br />At the White House  Web site, the biography of Reagan makes a brief reference to the  ideological evolution in the fourth paragraph: \"As president of the  Screen Actors Guild, Reagan became embroiled in disputes over the issue  of Communism in the film industry; his political views shifted from  liberal to conservative.\" <br /><br />And then Reagan, noted for his quips,  said it himself in a Sept. 28, 1982, news conference exchange with ABC  White House correspondent Sam Donaldson over whether the White House was  to blame for the continuing U.S. recession.<br /><br />Donaldson: \"Mr.  President, in talking about the continuing recession tonight, you have  blamed mistakes in the past and you have blamed the Congress. Does any  of the blame belong to you?\" <br /><br />Reagan: \"Yes, because for many years  I was a Democrat.\"<br /><br />White House press corps: (Laughter.)<br /><br />Historian  Edward Yager, a government professor at Western Kentucky University and  author of the 2006 biography <em>Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s Journey: Democrat to  Republican</em>, said Reagan \"was registered Democrat from the time that he  voted for FDR in 1932, when he was 21.\"<br /><br />Yager said he&rsquo;s never  seen copies of the voter registration cards, but noted \"virtually all  the sources that refer to\" Reagan&rsquo;s party affiliation indicate that he  was registered as a Democrat and that \"he has two autobiographies in  which he refers to his voting for FDR four times, then for Truman.\"  Reagan was a Democrat, added Yager, even when he voted for Dwight D.  Eisenhower.<br /><br />Reagan had considered switching by 1960, said Yager,  but there were some in the Nixon camp who \"thought he might be more  effective (as a supporter) by maintaining his Democrat registration and  affiliation and cutting into Democratic voters.\" <br /><br />It may be among the great, forgotten  flip-flops in political history that evolved into a laugh line for a  man venerated for his ideological adherence to the principles of the  Grand Ole Party. But Crist was correct when he invoked it. We find his  claim to be True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-30T11:33:47.651527", "ruling_date": "2010-03-30T14:20:23", "ruling_headline": "Crist says Reagan was a Democrat before converting to GOP", "ruling_headline_slug": "crist-says-reagan-was-democrat-converting-gop", "ruling_link_text": "He was not a lifelong Republican", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation &amp; Library Web site, 1960: <a href=\"http://www.reaganlibrary.com/life-and-times.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Changing times  for Ronald Reagan</a>.<br /><br />E-mail interview with Melissa Giller,  director of communications, Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation &amp;  Library, March 30, 2010.<br /><br />YouTube video clip, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRUbwnkEPqc\" target=\"_blank\">Ronald Reagan's Funny  Answer</a>.
