Now we&#39;ve had job growth, I think, for 24 consecutive months,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&#39;ve heard a lot of chatter about the job numbers and whether they really indicate a recovery, so we decided to look further.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, a look at what the employment situation was like when Obama took office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that in January 2009, when the president was sworn in, the country lost 818,000 jobs. (The numbers do not include farm workers and are adjusted for seasonal shifts in employment, but that&#39;s the standard way of calculating employment and unemployment rates.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s 17 percent more than the 700,000 jobs Cicilline cited.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(To put the numbers in perspective, the losses for the first three full months that Obama was in office averaged 738,000 per month. The average job loss for the last three full months of the Bush administration was 651,000.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen it comes to the <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0000000001?output_view=net_1mth\">number of months</a> in which the United States has had job growth, Cicilline&#39;s timeframe was also somewhat off.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cesbtab1.htm\">BLS data</a> show that the last time the United States lost jobs was in September 2010, when 27,000 jobs were lost.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s 22 months ago, not 24. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow significant have the increases been?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/07/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-500000-net-jobs-month-historicall/\">told PolitiFact National</a> in May that the economy needs to create 90,000 to 100,000 jobs each month just to keep pace with the number of people coming into the work force.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring 7 of those 22 months, including as recently as April, May and June of this year, job growth was below 100,000. In 8 of the 22 months, it was over 200,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked his campaign for the source of Cicilline&#39;s statement, spokeswoman Nicole Kayner sent us <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/08/03/employment-situation-july\">a White House blog item</a> from Aug. 3 reporting: &quot;The economy has now added private sector jobs for 29 straight months.&quot; We confirmed that with the BLS database, but this is for non-government jobs, and Cicilline didn&#39;t make that distinction in his debate comment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the debate, U.S. Rep. David Cicilline said: &quot;When President Obama took office, we were losing 700,000 jobs a month. Now we&#39;ve had job growth, I think, for 24 consecutive months.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe want to note, as we repeatedly have, that even though there&#39;s been improvement in the job numbers during the Obama administration, a president&#39;s ability to influence the economy is severely limited.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for Cicilline&rsquo;s comment, he understated the job losses occurring when President Obama took office and, by the most commonly used measure, he overstated by two months the timespan of continued job growth. But his main point -- that there has been growth for nearly two years -- is sound. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause the statement is &quot;accurate but needs clarification or additional information,&quot; we rule it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">Mostly True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter:<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> @politifactri</a>.
