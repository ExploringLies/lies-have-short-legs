John Lehman of Racine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad makes a number of boasts about the Walker-Kleefisch administration, including this one: &quot;95 percent of job creators say Wisconsin is headed in the right direction.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s decidedly favorable; but, the way the group states it,<strong> </strong>also misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Previous claim</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker made a similar claim in February 2012, saying 94 percent of Wisconsin employers think the state &quot;is heading in the right direction&quot; and a majority say they will &quot;grow their companies in 2012.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rated his statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/11/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-94-percent-wisconsin-employe/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Half True</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both numbers were correct.
