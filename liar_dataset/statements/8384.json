We <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2013/oct/02/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-cuccinelli-tried-shut-down-va-gover/\"><u>rated</u></a> McAuliffe&rsquo;s claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time, we&rsquo;ll examine a Cuccinelli charge -- made in a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX7E9UFJbeA&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><u>radio ad</u></a> -- that it&rsquo;s McAuliffe who&rsquo;s gung-ho for government gridlock. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He&rsquo;s already threatened to shut down Virginia&rsquo;s government if his budget plan isn&rsquo;t supported,&quot; the narrator says of McAuliffe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anna Nix, a Cuccinelli campaign spokeswoman, told us the claim refers to McAuliffe&rsquo;s repeated vow that he won&rsquo;t sign a budget as governor unless it provides for Medicaid expansion. An additional 400,000 low-income Virginians would be eligible for the health care program next year under an Obamacare offering. &nbsp;In the first three years the federal government would pay 100 percent of the new cost. After that, the share gradually declines to 90 percent, with the state paying the rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Virginia lawmakers have not decided whether to expand the state&rsquo;s program, instead opting for a commission that will recommend efficiencies to Medicaid before a final choice is made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAuliffe says the state would be foolish to turn down the federal money. Cuccinelli and many Republican legislators oppose expanding Medicaid, saying Washington can&rsquo;t be trusted over the long term to pay its promised share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuccinelli&rsquo;s spokeswoman noted that McAuliffe said in a June 1 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HwDD41X4-M\"><u>dinner speech</u></a> to Loudoun County Democrats, &quot;No budget gets done unless the governor signs that legislation. I will not sign a budget in Virginia unless the Medicaid expansion is included. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAuliffe was <a href=\"http://states.aarp.org/va-gubernatorial-candidates-where-they-stand/\"><u>quoted </u></a>by the AARP on Aug. 29 saying he wouldn&rsquo;t sign budget that doesn&rsquo;t fund Medicaid expansion. During a Sept. 7 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twt3LTlpecU&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><u>speech </u></a>in Arlington, McAuliffe said, &quot;My opponent doesn&rsquo;t support the Medicaid expansion. I have asked the legislators `Please do not send me a bill&rsquo; -- because the governor has to sign the bill for the budget to come into effect -- &lsquo;please don&rsquo;t send me a bill unless the Medicaid expansion is included.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growing the program would certainly run into stiff opposition from Republicans in the General Assembly. But is McAuliffe&rsquo;s pledge not to sign a budget that excludes Medicaid expansion tantamount to a threat to shut down government?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s dig deeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a governor does not sign a budget bill that has been passed by the General Assembly, it automatically becomes law, according to A.E. Dick Howard, a University of Virginia law professor who helped draft a revised state constitution that voters adopted in 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Howard pointed to Article 5, Section 6 of the <a href=\"http://constitution.legis.virginia.gov/constitution.htm#5S6\"><u>state constitution</u></a>, which says if the governor receives a bill while the General Assembly is in session, he has seven days to sign, amend or veto the legislation, or it becomes law. If the governor receives a bill when the General Assembly is not in session, he has 30 days to act before the measure becomes law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any budget amendments offered by a governor can be defeated by a majority vote in either chamber. Should the governor veto a budget, the legislature can override it with a two-thirds vote of each house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McAuliffe says his budget-signing vow will never come into play if he becomes governor because he&rsquo;s certain he could convince a majority of legislators to approve Medicaid expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No budget will be shut down in Virginia over the Medicaid expansion,&quot; McAuliffe said during a Sept. 25 debate with Cuccinelli. &quot;I will work in a bipartisan way to get it done&hellip;so we won&rsquo;t have any government shutdown.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Our ruling</strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuccinelli says McAuliffe has threatened to shut down state government. He points to McAuliffe&rsquo;s repeated promise not to sign a state budget that does not allow for Medicaid expansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But McAuliffe&rsquo;s vow, if carried out, would not close Virginia&rsquo;s government. If a governor does not sign the budget, it automatically becomes law no more than 30 days after the General Assembly sent it to his desk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s striking that Cuccinelli, who has served almost four years as attorney general after an eight-year career in the state Senate, overlooked this constitutional provision. We rate his statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-10-11T10:17:40.713786", "ruling_date": "2013-10-11T10:17:37", "ruling_headline": "Cuccinelli says McAuliffe threatened to shut down state government over Medicaid", "ruling_headline_slug": "cuccinelli-says-mcauliffe-threatened-shut-down-sta", "ruling_link_text": "Constitutional problem with claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Cuccinelli for Governor, &quot;Cuccinelli unveils new radio ad, &lsquo;shutdown,&rsquo;&quot; Oct. 2, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cuccinelli for Governor, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX7E9UFJbeA&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><u>&quot;Shutdown,&quot;</u></a> Oct. 1, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-mail from Anna Nix, spokeswoman for the Cuccinelli campaign, Oct. 2, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E-mail from Josh Schwerin, spokesman for the McAuliffe campaign, Oct. 2, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interviews with A.E.
