That means we can probably expect more debates like the one that happened at the City Club of Portland in late March.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBack then, Mary Nolan closed up the debate by going after Fritz one last time with a pretty damning summation of her four years as a council member: &quot;By her own count, Amanda has initiated only 3 percent of City Council action items while she&#39;s been there. She manages less than 5 percent of city operations -- whether you measure it by number of employees or by operating budget.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth are interesting points. For now, we&rsquo;re looking at how much of the city Fritz really manages. Five percent seemed low to us -- even with five council members divvying up the work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder Portland&rsquo;s form of government, the mayor assigns commissioners to manage certain offices and bureaus. There are about 20 larger offices and other smaller ones. Sometimes the assignments are a reflection of skill -- sometimes they&rsquo;re a reflection of politics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCurrently, Fritz oversees the Bureau of Emergency Communications, the Office of Healthy Working Rivers, the Office of Equity and Human Rights and the Office of Neighborhood Involvement. She also has a budget and employee count specific to her own office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we checked the number of employees budgeted for those offices, we got a total of 208 full-time equivalent positions. The bulk of that comes from Emergency Communications, which has 145 spots. All told, the city of Portland has a little under 5,800 FTE positions. If you divide 208 by that, you get about 3.6 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJust to offer a little bit of perspective here, Mayor Sam Adams oversees about half the city&rsquo;s employees. Randy Leonard, the mayor&rsquo;s closest political ally, comes in second with about 23 percent, then there&rsquo;s Nick Fish with about 9 percent and Dan Saltzman with 13 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we looked at the budgets, we found much the same. For the current budget cycle, Fritz&rsquo;s bureaus have a combined budget of just over $28 million. That&rsquo;s 1 percent of all the cash that flows in and out of the city, which has a net budget of $2.8 billion. And it&rsquo;s just over 1.6 percent of the $1.7 billion bureau expenditures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter we had all the numbers straightened out, we called Nolan&rsquo;s campaign to make sure we were on the same page. We were. Our next call was to Amanda Fritz.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That&#39;s probably true -- I haven&rsquo;t run the numbers myself,&quot; she said. But &quot;the amount of work is not related to the number of employees or the budget of the bureau.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe also pointed out that she previously oversaw the city&rsquo;s Cable Communications and Franchise Office, which was the second highest revenue generator for the city during the recession. What&rsquo;s more, Fritz has been in charge of creating two new offices (Equity and Health Working Rivers) -- something that she said is particularly time intensive. &quot;Establishing a new bureau is a lot more difficult than taking over a bureau,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, she noted that the office of Neighborhood Involvement may have just 39 budgeted positions, but it works with a network of thousands of volunteers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe context -- and the fact that assignments are ultimately up to the mayor -- may take some of the bite out of Nolan&rsquo;s remark but it doesn&rsquo;t make it wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe numbers back Nolan up; if you look at budgets or staffing, Fritz manages less than 5 percent of city operations. We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-31T18:16:07.262006", "ruling_date": "2012-05-31T15:11:31", "ruling_headline": "How much of city government does Amanda Fritz manage by budget or employee count?", "ruling_headline_slug": "how-much-city-government-does-amanda-fritz-manage-", "ruling_link_text": "Nolan's right, though it's not Fritz's choice", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tInterview with Amanda Fritz, May 30, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail from Kristi Jo Lewis, spokeswoman for Mary Nolan, May 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCity of Portland,<a href=\"http://www.portlandonline.com/omf/index.cfm?c=55390&amp;a=358663\"> Adopted Budget</a>, fiscal year 2011-2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Represents Southwest Portland in Oregon House", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Mary", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Oregon", "id": 1358, "last_name": "Nolan", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "mary-nolan", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/nolan.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1358/", "total_count": 5, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://gov.oregonlive.com/legislators/Mary-Nolan/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Amanda Fritz &quot;manages less than 5 percent of city operations.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a debate.", "statement_date": "2012-03-30", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 203, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/203/", "subject": "City Government", "subject_slug": "city-government", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/2/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Portland city commissioner", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Amanda ", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 1489, "last_name": "Fritz", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "amanda-fritz", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AmandaFritz.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1489/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": ""}
