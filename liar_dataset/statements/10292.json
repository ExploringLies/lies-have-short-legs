Allen Peake, R-Macon serves as co-chair of a joint legislative committee that has studied whether and how to legalize the drug for certain conditions, including seizures in children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peake has revived a bill aimed at allowing cannabis oil made from marijuana plants for treatment of certain seizure disorders and other health problems. He is finalizing that proposal, pre-filed as House Bill 1 after a similar measure fell short last session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But another committee member, state Sen. Curt Thompson, D-Tucker, is proposing a competing bill that would allow vaporized, edible or smokable marijuana. Thompson also has filed a resolution, calling for a statewide referendum on whether to authorize recreational use of the drug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Confusion about the oil form versus a smokeable drug has prompted Peake, who said he does not support expanded use, to speak out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We believe that the medical cannabis oil &ndash; &nbsp;very low in THC, that doesn&rsquo;t have a psychoactive component to it, cannot get you high &ndash; is a better approach for our citizens,&quot; Peake said in a press conference before a committee meeting last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opponents of the oil have raised safety concerns. So PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a closer look at &nbsp;Peake&rsquo;s contention that the oil extracted from marijuana won&rsquo;t get users high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, a reminder that the federal government still classifies marijuana as a Schedule I substance, defined as &quot;the most dangerous&quot; drug &quot;with no currently accepted medical use.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite that designation, 23 states have legalized medical marijuana, allowing access to the drug for a variety of medical conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another 11 states &ndash; including neighboring Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee &nbsp;&ndash; have enacted laws allowing cannabis oil products for medical reasons in limited situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key difference in allowing the oil, supporters say, is that it is high in cannabidiol and low in tetrahydrocannabinol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both are compounds found in the marijuana plant that act on cell receptors that control neurotransmitters in the brain and the immune system from various organs, such as the spleen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cannabidiol, known as CBD, is an antioxidant and not psychoactive. Tetrahydrocannabinol or THC is the long-known mind-altering part of pot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cannabis oil is made from strains of marijuana already bred to be high in CBD and low in THC. For medical use, the oil is made with less than 3 percent THC and is orally ingested. Children&rsquo;s doses tend to be at 1 percent THC, or lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies are scarce on the medical benefits of such a product, given the Schedule I classification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But research does show that THC is what brings both it and CBD into the brain, where CBD&rsquo;s antioxidant properties are thought to protect the brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That evidence helped the federal Department of Health and Human Services earn a patent on medical marijuana in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anecdotally, parents of children with epilepsy and other seizure diseases back up the findings, reporting marked improvement from the cannabis oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A London drug company, GW Pharmaceuticals, has created a drug out of highly purified CBD that has shown in preclinical studies that it potentially reduce seizures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The firm is waiting on final approval from Georgia Regents University and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration to begin clinical trials in Georgia with children who have severe seizure disorders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of the existing studies or anecdotes from parents acknowledge or report any &quot;high&quot; from cannabis oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the National Institute on Drug Abuse, while acknowledging the federal government does not see marijuana as medicine, reports that CBD as a &quot;non-psychoactive cannabinoid&quot; that may prove useful in treating epilepsy as well as some inflamation disorders and mental illnesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, while the medical use of cannabis oil can be debated given the limited number of medical and clinic studies, there is some common ground on the product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marijuana remains officially a more dangerous drug than cocaine, according to the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the main component of the plant used to make cannabis oil doesn&rsquo;t have the mind-altering, munchies-inducing effect associated with street use of the plant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Peake&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-12-08T16:01:54.630561", "ruling_date": "2014-12-09T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Weeding out the different effects of cannabis oil and marijuana", "ruling_headline_slug": "weeding-out-different-effects-cannabis-oil-and-mar", "ruling_link_text": "Oil lacks enough THC to provide a high", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>State Rep.
