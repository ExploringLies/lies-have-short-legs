Almost overnight, the future of the popular attraction became a key issue in the April 5, 2016 election between Abele and challenger Chris Larson, a Democratic state senator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Larson calls the three-dome complex a county treasure and vows to keep the facility running. Abele has been more open to a change, even suggesting residents may prefer something else, such as an amphitheater, to replace them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/news/county-exec-candidates-weigh-in-on-fate-of-domes/38313926\">March 3, 2016 interview on WISN-TV</a>, Abele argued it is important to keep options open because the Domes are expensive to operate and not as popular as in past years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What most people don&#39;t know is that the Domes lose $1 million-plus each year,&quot; he said in the interview. &quot;The number of people going to the Domes has been going down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That doesn&rsquo;t sound good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the county&rsquo;s own <a href=\"http://county.milwaukee.gov/Domes\">web site</a> offers a different take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Domes run an annual operating deficit averaging $630,000 per year, even as attendance has increased,&quot; it says, crediting creative programming. Indeed, that programming has taken place under Abele&rsquo;s watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, which is right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Losing money</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike a freestanding business, the Domes don&rsquo;t report a &quot;loss&quot; when expenses exceed revenue. Rather, the difference falls to county taxpayers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The loss refers to how much in general property tax money it costs to keep the attraction open, above and beyond admissions and space rental fees (and after expenses).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>County figures show that going back five years, taxpayer support has ranged from a low of $386,803 in 2015 to a high of $1.11 million in 2014. That was the only year the loss topped $1 million, undermining the &quot;each year&quot; part of Abele&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The average amount spent by taxpayers in that five-year period was $628,000 &ndash; just about what the county&rsquo;s web site said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A memo provided by Abele spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said that &quot;spikes in expenses in recent years are due to engineering studies and significant remedial work completed on the structure.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The costs for 2016, of course, are likely to be higher. For instance, the county plans to spend $500,000 on netting and other measures so the facility can reopen while officials sort out its long-term future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, the numbers show the opposite of what Abele claimed when it comes to attendance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been a steady increase in the past five years, from 187,658 in 2011 &ndash; the first year that Abele was in office &ndash; to 240,179 in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baldauff acknowledged the recent growth in attendance, but noted: &quot;In the past the Domes saw annual attendance of more than 374,000 people.&quot; She added: &quot;We are far away from the attendance the Domes used to see.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked: When did the Domes last have 374,000 visitors?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer: 1988.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that was a generation ago. There have undoubtedly been ups and downs over the years since, but there&rsquo;s no question attendance has been on the rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abele says the Domes lose more than $1 million every year and that the number of people visiting the attraction has been declining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s wrong on both counts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past five years, the tab for county taxpayers exceeded $1 million once. On average it was $630,000. Meanwhile, attendance has actually increased 28 percent under his watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-03-16T17:49:28.324412", "ruling_date": "2016-03-18T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Abele says Mitchell Park Domes cost taxpayers 1 million a year, have fewer visitors", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-abele-says-mitchell-park-domes-cost-taxpayer", "ruling_link_text": "Just the opposite", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/news/county-exec-candidates-weigh-in-on-fate-of-domes/38313926\">WISN-TV interview with Chris Abele</a>, March 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/mitchell-park-domes-work-could-cost-up-to-75-million-b99666359z1-368082501.html\">&quot;Mitchell Parks Domes work could cost up to $75 million,&quot; </a>Feb. 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee County.gov</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails, Melissa Baldauff, spokeswoman, Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, March 3 and 11, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "Philanthropist", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "", "id": 959, "last_name": "Abele", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "chris-abele", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Abele_Chris_PFACT_2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/959/", "total_count": 22, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://chrisabele.com/"}, "statement": "<p>The Mitchell Park Domes &quot;lose about $1 million-plus every year&quot; and &quot;the number of people going to the Domes has been going down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview", "statement_date": "2016-03-03", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 171, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/171/", "subject": "County Budget", "subject_slug": "county-budget", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
