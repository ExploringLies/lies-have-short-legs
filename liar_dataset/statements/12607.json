contains many free trade provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>** This is a vote for &quot;fast track authority&quot; &mdash; allowing trade agreement to move through Congress without amendments or filibusters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*** The free trade agreement with Bahrain passed by unanimous consent, not a recorded roll call vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Employment impact unclear</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The jury is still out on the impact of trade deals on employment, even after decades of debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On one side, unions and some left-leaning think tanks often link American job losses to expanded trade. Labor advocates opposed the Chile and Singapore agreements, which they said in a <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/agreements/morocco/pdfs/LAC%20Report%20for%20Singapore.pdf\">2003 report</a> would kill an unspecified number of jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The liberal Economic Policy Institute, which Trump cited, has found that NAFTA has cost the United States over <a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/a/elg/rokejn/v2y2014i4p429-441.html\">800,000 jobs</a>, and the South Korean deal cost about <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/blog/korea-trade-deal-resulted-growing-trade/\">60,000</a>. In a 2014 report, the think tank reported that the United States has lost <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/china-trade-outsourcing-and-jobs/\">3.2 million jobs</a> between 2001 and 2013 to trade with China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business groups, on the other hand, argue that trade deals actually boost employment. For example, a <a href=\"https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/legacy/reports/100514_ftajobs_full_0.pdf\">2010 report</a> by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that the 14 trade deals in place in 2008 supported 5.4 million jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.uschina.org/media/press/uscbc-epi-study-us-jobs-trade-deficit-and-china-currency-wrong\">U.S-China Business Council</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d655ef5c-f1b8-11e5-a609-e9f2438ee05b.html#axzz45SK55GKR\">Financial Times</a> contend that the loss in manufacturing jobs were not due to trade with China so much as gains in technology and productivity, as well as the result of a more sophisticated economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/07/bernie-s/sanders-overshoots-nafta-job-losses/\">recent fact-check</a>, we found several nonpartisan reports demonstrating that NAFTA produced no significant job losses nor job gains. <a href=\"http://fordschool.umich.edu/rsie/workingpapers/Papers476-500/r490.pdf\">Analysis</a> by economists at Tufts University and the University of Michigan projected no net impact on employment from the Chile, Singapore and South Korea deals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton &lsquo;for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions of jobs.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He accurately recasted Sanders&rsquo; words, but that doesn&rsquo;t make the attack any more correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of the 10 trade deals Clinton could have voted on, she voted in favor of six and against two. On two other deals (with Peru and Jordan), she didn&rsquo;t vote but did vouch for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for subsequent job losses, independent research has shown the impact of NAFTA, for example, to not be significant one way or the other for jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s claim is partially accurate and needs additional information. We rate his statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-29T11:42:34.619832", "ruling_date": "2016-06-29T11:57:17", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump quotes Bernie Sanders' Half True claim about Clinton, free trade", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-quotes-bernie-sanders-half-true-claim", "ruling_link_text": "Accurate quote, not-so-accurate claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A55goJJKYE\">Full Speech: Donald Trump Delivers Economic Policy Speech in Monessen, Pennsylvania</a>,&quot; June 28, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/10/bernie-s/clinton-voted-virtually-every-trade-agreement-kill/\">Clinton voted for &#39;virtually every&#39; trade agreement, killing millions of jobs, Sanders says</a>,&quot; April 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton &lsquo;voted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions of jobs.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech in Monessen, Penn.", "statement_date": "2016-06-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 143, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/143/", "subject": "Trade", "subject_slug": "trade", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ".@realDonaldTrump borrows Half True attack on Clinton from Bernie Sanders"}
