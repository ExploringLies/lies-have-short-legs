It says, &quot;Semi-automatic weapons, whether pistol or rifle, were designed for use by the military on the battlefield.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is no doubt that some of the semi-automatic weapons sold to consumers these days are either very close to those used by soldiers or designed to have the characteristics of military weapons. It&#39;s one of their selling points. For example, <a href=\"http://www.bushmaster.com/electronic-documents/TechSheets/XM15%20Model%20PDFs/M4%20Type%20Carbines.pdf\">Bushmaster M4-type carbines</a> are advertised as having a &quot;distinctive military barrel profile.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.bushmaster.com/support/about.asp\">The company says</a> its products are used &quot;by the military of more than 50 countries worldwide.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut we also know that other weapons, such as many hunting rifles, meet the definition of semi-automatic. So we wondered whether it&rsquo;s accurate to say that all semi-automatics were really designed for military use.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe contacted the City Council&rsquo;s majority leader, Seth Yurdin,to see what evidence he had.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe wrote back in an e-mail that, &quot;Semi-automatic weapons as a class were designed for the battlefield. Why? Semi-automatic weapons are efficient at killing as many people as quickly as possible.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter listing several different types of weapons used in mass shootings, Yurdin said, &quot;Yes, there may be particular semi-automatic weapons that have not been designed to win military bids, but the point is that semi-automatic weapons are designed to be efficient killing machines.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe tried unsuccessfully to contact several manufacturers about the histories of their products, but they did not respond.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut four experts with whom we did speak said the statement in the City Council resolution is wrong because many semi-automatic weapons -- from the very first to those in use today -- were not designed for war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.northeastern.edu/history/faculty/william-m-fowler-jr/\">William Fowler</a>, distinguished professor of history at Northeastern University, in Boston, said semi-automatic weapons &quot;are not necessarily military. Shotguns, for example, can be gas operated,&quot; utilizing gas from the discharge of one round to push the next round into the chamber, ready for the trigger to be pulled again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGoing back to the beginning, the first design of a semi-automatic rifle was unveiled in 1885. American gunsmith John Moses Browning crafted the first semi-automatic shotgun in 1902. By 1910, Winchester, Remington and others were making semi-automatic sporting rifles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen they were first manufactured, &quot;a lot of time the semis were intended for use by the general public,&quot; said Frank Hanner, director of the National Infantry Museum in Fort Benning, Ga. &quot;These were pocket pistols and different things, what we would consider to be a Saturday night special today. A lot of these were intended for protection on the street.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The semi-automatic system was NOT specifically developed for the military,&quot; said Richard Colton, a historian at the Springfield Armory in Massachusetts, who cited the semi-automatic pistols that came out in the 1890s, many of them made in Germany, that were supposed to be for personal use.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDavid Stieghan, U.S. Army Infantry branch historian at Ft. Benning, said, &quot;Semi-automatic weapons such as shotguns and .22 caliber hunting rifles had already been in existence for 40 years&quot; before the U.S. military became the first to adopt them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The initial push was to manufacture them for hunting, and home defense and self-defense, because very few in the military cared about them until after World War I,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy didn&#39;t the military embrace them earlier?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;They were difficult to machine and manufacture in a way that was inexpensive, and they were not amenable to use in the trenches of World War I,&quot; said Stieghan. &quot;With all the mud, dirt, water and everything else, they were just not reliable enough.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd what about weapons for sale today?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStieghan said the vast majority of semi-automatic firearms available to the public were never designed for -- nor offered for sale to -- the military.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;There are all sorts of semi-automatic weapons that are unacceptable [to the military] because they&#39;re not rugged enough and they don&#39;t have the long-range and accuracy that the military would require,&quot; he said. &quot;They are designed specifically for consumers.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Providence City Council, in a resolution approved earlier this month, asserted: &quot;Semi-automatic weapons, whether pistol or rifle, were designed for use by the military on the battlefield.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe military and gun experts we consulted told us that history tells a very different story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe military did not embrace the weapons until decades after they were developed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven today, there are many semi-automatic weapons available to consumers that were not designed for battlefield use.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy bother with such distinctions? The contentious debate over gun control is consuming the nation.
