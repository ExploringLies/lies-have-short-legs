But this ad misleads by failing to tell the full picture. It doesn&rsquo;t tell viewers that all of Rubio&rsquo;s skipped votes pertain to one bill, and that Rubio voted for the overall bill, while Cruz actually voted against it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman said the PAC didn&rsquo;t have a plan yet regarding where the ad will run, but <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/cruz-super-pac-aims-to-take-out-rubio-in-florida-220355\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Politico</u></a> reported that it will air in Florida, where voting by mail and at early sites is already underway leading up to the March 15 primary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Defense votes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad cites a Feb. 17 article in <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/17/exclusive-team-cruz-fires-at-rubio-for-skipping-18-defense-bill-votes-in-2015-marco-was-nowhere-to-be-found/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Breitbart</u></a>, a conservative website, about Rubio skipping 18 defense votes in 2015. These votes relate to a single bill: the National Defense Authorization Act, which sets spending and policies for the Defense Department, for military construction and for security programs within the Energy Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eleven of the 18 skipped votes cited by Breitbart were on amendments before the bill passed. Other votes were procedural or largely after the Senate passed the bill, for example, working out differences between the two chambers or on the conference report before the bill went to President Barack Obama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio&rsquo;s skipped votes included amendments to revise the <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00203\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>definition of spouse for veterans benefits</u></a>, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00209\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>reaffirm the prohibition on torture</u></a> and to <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00207\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>improve cybersecurity</u></a>. (Cruz himself skipped three of the 18 votes that Rubio missed.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad emphasized that one of Rubio&rsquo;s missed votes was to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days before the Senate voted on the final bill, Rubio skipped a vote on an amendment to provide weapons and training for the <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00210\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Kurdistan Regional Government</u></a>. On June 16, the Senate voted 54-45 for the amendment, but that wasn&rsquo;t high enough to meet the 60 votes threshold for passage. Although Rubio skipped the vote, he was <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/amendment/114th-congress/senate-amendment/1549/cosponsors\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a co-sponsor</u></a> of the amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sen.
