The device solely fires steel BBs, Justin Biddle, a marketing manager at <a href=\"http://umarexusa.com/\">Umarex USA</a>, told us in an interview.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGonz&aacute;lez helped us isolate the <a href=\"http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/15/76/5001\">federal law</a> that regulates the appearance of imitation firearms, stipulating the 6-millimeter orange marking requirement for airsoft guns. Those guns shoot projectiles at a lower speed than pellet or BB guns, according to <a href=\"http://www.sog.unc.edu/user/102\">Jeffrey Welty</a>, an assistant professor of public law and government at the University of North Carolina School of Government, who specializes in criminal law and procedure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the marking requirement does not apply to &quot;traditional BB, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of air pressure,&quot; the law says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the gun used in Brownsville was exempt from federal marking requirements.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the wake of the shooting, the office of Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, also examined legal issues related to facsimile firearms, said J.J. Garza, Oliveira&rsquo;s chief of staff. Garza pointed us to another part of the <a href=\"http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/15/76/5001\">U.S. Code</a>, Section G, which states that federal provisions on imitation gun identification supersede such local or state laws and ordinances.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut are there state and local restrictions anyway? &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/press-room/ncsl-news-team.aspx\">Meagan Dorsch</a>, a spokeswoman for the <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/\">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>, emailed us the organization&rsquo;s July 2011 list showing states with imitation firearm statutes: &nbsp;Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee and Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered how any state statutes survive without conflicting with the superseding federal law.
