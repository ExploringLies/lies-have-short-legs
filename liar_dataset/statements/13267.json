At that time, Elfant said, another 11,000 applications had yet to be processed while more applications would come in before the <a href=\"http://www.votetexas.gov/register-to-vote/you-must-register-by/\">voter registration deadline of Oct. 11</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Elfant says he started from federal research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wondering about Elfant&rsquo;s 90-percent-plus figure, we asked him to share his math.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, Elfant replied that he started from a U.S. Census Bureau estimate indicating that in 2015, the county was home to 778,077 citizens of voting age and then adjusted that figure to get to an updated estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To reach the new estimate, Elfant said, he assumed the number of voting-age citizens in the county increased the same amount from 2015 to 2016 that it did, according to the bureau, from 2014 to 2015--or 18,551. But, he said, he reduced the 18,551 figure to cover just the stretch of 2016 preceding the mid-October registration deadline--getting an estimated gain of 16,232 voting-age citizens. Elfant said he then added the partial-year estimate to the bureau&rsquo;s 2015 estimate of 778,077 voting-age citizens, reaching his October 2016 estimate of 794,309 voting-age&nbsp;citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Elfant said, he divided the 713,871 people registered to vote in the county as of mid-October 2016 into his estimate of voting-age citizens, getting the 90 percent result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we&nbsp;heard back from Elfant a couple days later, he said the county&rsquo;s tally of registered residents had reached 717,694, or 90.4 percent of voting-eligible residents by his analysis. On Oct. 14, 2016, Elfant emailed: &quot;With at least 17,000 voter registrations still unprocessed, it is likely that 91% or even 92% are actually registered to vote but we won&rsquo;t have a final tally for another week.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Census Bureau surveys</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sought to check the census bureau figures, hearing back from a bureau spokeswoman, Jewel Jordan, who pointed us to a <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk\">bureau web page</a> containing Elfant&rsquo;s cited estimates of voting-age citizens in the county in 2014 and 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jordan said by email the bureau nationally estimates voting-age citizens through its American Community Survey, which in 2015 <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample-size-and-data-quality/sample-size/index.php\">entailed interviews of residents of more than 2 million U.S. households</a>. <a href=\"http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/questionnaires/2015/quest15.pdf\">Each person&rsquo;s survey</a> included a request for each resident&rsquo;s birth date and: &quot;Is the person a citizen of the U.S.?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Outside experts say&nbsp;estimates at play</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To our inquiries, experts called Elfant&rsquo;s methodology sound even though he depended on estimated counts of voting-age citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stedwards.edu/directory/employees/brian-w-smith\">Brian W. Smith</a>, a St. Edward&rsquo;s University political scientist, and <a href=\"https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/faculty/hensonjr\">James Henson </a>of the University of Texas each pointed out by email that the bureau figures employed by Elfant to reflect citizens eligible to vote are estimates, not to-the-person counts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith said that outside of the government&rsquo;s decennial census, &quot;population surveys are always estimates which include a margin of error. It is not a precise measure because the population is always changing because of deaths, migration, undercounts etc. For example, if Travis County grew at a much faster rate than the estimates, the results could be under 90%, but we cannot be certain,&quot; Smith said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, Smith wrote, it&rsquo;s reasonable to speculate that 90 percent of eligible residents has registered because some 86 percent appear to have done so in 2014 and that was a &quot;low salience mid-year election.&quot; Smith reached the 86 percent figure by comparing the <a href=\"http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist175_race833.htm\">county&rsquo;s 655,056 registered voters</a> as of Nov. 4, 2014 to the bureau&rsquo;s 2014 estimate of 759,526 county residents eligible to vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith elaborated: &quot;The county had two years to increase the voter registered rate by 3.8% and a lot of events in their favor&quot; such as competitive March 2016 party primaries including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as a candidate; an antic general-election campaign period; and a surge in voters registering statewide. Days after Elfant spoke, Texas Secretary of State Carlos Cascos said a record 15 million-plus Texas citizens had registered to vote--or 78 percent of the state&rsquo;s estimated voting age population of 19.3 million though that count included non-citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.austincc.edu/cppps/bios/young.html\">Peck Young</a>, who oversees the Austin Community College Center for Public Policy &amp; Political Studies, said: &quot;It is clear that this year 90+&quot; percent &quot;of the Citizen Voting Age Population &nbsp;of Travis County has been registered.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Texas state official</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also asked Alicia Pierce of the secretary of state&rsquo;s office to assess Elfant&rsquo;s claim; she emailed us a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n3vamyTdpx8OrJDWlrhcMm8tekHV7sj-yERGb2NsRw4/edit?usp=sharing\">spreadsheet</a> tallying registered Texas voters by county and showing Travis County with 720,186 registered voters. That count breaks out to 90.7 percent of the county&rsquo;s citizens eligible to vote as estimated by Elfant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, Pierce advised that the state sticks to calculating registration rates using only voting-age population estimates--rather than working from estimates of citizens of voting age. In part, she said, the agency relies on the less precise metric to ease historical comparisons. The voting-age population estimates, Pierce said, come from the <a href=\"http://osd.texas.gov/AboutUs\">Texas Demographic Center</a> located at the University of Texas at San Antonio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elfant said that over 90 percent of Travis County&rsquo;s eligible residents registered to vote in advance of the November 2016 elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comparing the more than 713,871 voters registered at the time Elfant spoke to the county&rsquo;s estimated 794,309 voting-age citizens--a figure rooted in 2015 household surveys--gets you to 90 percent. Folding in registrations tallied after Elfant spoke drives the result to a bit more than 90 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>TRUE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.&nbsp;Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"> more</a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2e803387-3a35-4bf7-9901-e8025335a28a\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2e803387-3a35-4bf7-9901-e8025335a28a</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-14T15:58:55.362070", "ruling_date": "2016-10-14T16:21:30", "ruling_headline": "Bruce Elfant says 90-plus percent of eligible Travis County residents have registered to vote", "ruling_headline_slug": "bruce-elfant-says-90-plus-percent-eligible-travis-", "ruling_link_text": "Estimates at work", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>News story, <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local/travis-county-registers-more-than-90-percent-of-el/nsn8h/\">&quot;Travis County registers more than 90 percent of eligible voters,&quot;</a> <em>Austin American-Statesman</em>, Oct. 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LRg7ClQSn4YK8RGf7jkHL949FObGku2pQJQsNQKltcY/pub\">Emails (excerpted)</a> and telephone interview, Bruce Elfant, Travis County tax assessor-collector and voter registrar, Oct. 12-14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Web pages, <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk\">&quot;SEX BY AGE BY NATIVITY AND CITIZENSHIP STATUS Universe: Total population 2015 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates, Travis County,&quot;</a> <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk\">&quot;SEX BY AGE BY NATIVITY AND CITIZENSHIP STATUS Universe: Total population 2014 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates, Travis County,&quot;</a> U.S. Census Bureau (accessed Oct. 13, 2016)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/questionnaires/2015/quest15.pdf\">American Community Survey for 2015</a>, U.S. Census Bureau (accessed Oct. 13, 2016)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chart and report, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/socdemo/voting/publications/p20/2014/Table04a.xls\">&quot;Reported Voting and Registration, for States: November 2014,&quot;</a> U.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p20-577.pdf\">&quot;Who Votes?
