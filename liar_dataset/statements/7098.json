Growth &quot;at a higher rate than all other groups doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that people are joining this particular faith at a faster rate than all others,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Other views</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo experts, <a href=\"http://experts.news.wisc.edu/experts/1225\">Robert Glenn Howard</a> of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and <a href=\"http://www.marquette.edu/theology/carey.shtml\">Patrick Carey</a> of Marquette University in Milwaukee, told us the terminology used by Pew more accurately reflects where Americans are.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHoward, a specialist in contemporary religious belief, said the Freedom From Religion Foundation&rsquo;s statement is basically on target in the sense that &quot;people are increasingly moving away from claiming a specific religious affiliation for themselves.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;However, the majority of those are not &lsquo;secular&rsquo; but instead see religion as important and describe themselves as either &lsquo;religious&rsquo; or &lsquo;spiritual,&rsquo;&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCarey, chairman of Catholic theology at Marquette, said that from the Pew study and others he follows, unaffiliated Americans are the fastest-growing segment in terms of religious identification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut aside from atheists and agnostics, who make up a small portion of that group, it&rsquo;s not correct to say that segment is secular or non-religious, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&#39;ll also note a <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/report-us-protestants-lose-majority-status-0\">news story</a> about the Pew study, in which &nbsp;the national religion writer for Associated Press observed:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Scholars have long debated whether people who say they no longer belong to a religious group should be considered secular. While the category as defined by Pew researchers includes atheists, it also encompasses majorities of people who say they believe in God, and a notable minority who pray daily or consider themselves &lsquo;spiritual&rsquo; but not &lsquo;religious.&rsquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Still, Pew found overall that most of the unaffiliated aren&#39;t actively seeking another religious home, indicating that their ties with organized religion are permanently broken.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Freedom From Religion Foundation said: &quot;Secular Americans are the fastest growing religious identification demographic in this country.&quot; It also used the term non-religious in place of secular.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statement is partially accurate, in that surveys identify unaffiliated Americans as the fastest-growing group.
