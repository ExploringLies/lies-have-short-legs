And his criticism has not relented since Walker survived an historic recall election in June 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeil took aim at Walker on July 19, 2012 in an <a href=\"http://www.slysoffice.com/\">interview</a> with John &quot;Sly&quot; Sylvester, a liberal radio talk show host on WTDY AM-FM in Madison.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker &quot;raises the pay of inmates,&quot; Beil complained, &quot;but we don&#39;t raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2011, Walker curbed state employees&rsquo; collective bargaining powers and cut their take-home pay by forcing them to pay more for their pensions and health insurance. He also put tighter restrictions on overtime for corrections workers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut has the Republican governor increased the pay of inmates who work in prisons, yet not given raises to the officers who work there?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Beil&#39;s evidence</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeil is executive director of the Madison-based <a href=\"http://www.wseu-24.org/\">Council </a><a href=\"http://www.wseu-24.org/\">24</a> of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, which represents corrections officers and a variety of other state employees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked for evidence to back his claim, he forwarded to us a May 2012 email from Lizzie Tegels, warden of the <a href=\"http://www.wi-doc.com/New_Lisbon.htm\">New Lisbon Correctional Institution</a>, a 500-cell, medium-security prison 80 miles northwest of Madison.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt says the prison would no longer pay a lower wage to inmates during their first 60 days of work. Paying new inmate workers a few pennies per hour less during their probationary period costs more -- in staff time to adjust pay rates -- than if the inmates received the regular wage, the email said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, this isn&rsquo;t giving any working inmates a pay raise. Rather, inmates new to working would get a higher starting wage than they would have previously, but only during their first two months on the job.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeil told us the change wasn&#39;t occurring only at New Lisbon, but suggested we contact the Department of Corrections for details.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince Beil&#39;s claim was aimed at Walker, we contacted the governor&#39;s office, as well as the Department of Corrections. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie and DOC spokeswoman Linda Eggert confirmed that corrections employees have not received a general raise since Walker took office in January 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, lawmakers in November 2011 imposed a two-year <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/lawmakers-to-hear-testimony-on-compensation-plan-for-state-workers-u933il5-134049798.html\">pay </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/lawmakers-to-hear-testimony-on-compensation-plan-for-state-workers-u933il5-134049798.html\">freeze</a> on state employees, although merit raises can be given.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the second part of Beil&rsquo;s claim, that corrections workers haven&rsquo;t gotten any raises under Walker, is correct.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>DOC response</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs for inmate pay, the governor&rsquo;s spokesman provided a response written by the office of Corrections Secretary Gary Hamblin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the memo:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin prisons can pay working inmates a lower wage during their probation period, but most don&#39;t; neither does Badger State Industries, which oversees the manufacturing of license plates and other goods made by inmates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEliminating the lower pay rate at New Lisbon means that current and future workers now start at the regular pay grade. That ranges from 9 to 42 cents an hour (and 1 to 20 cents through Badger State Industries). About 1,000 inmates work at New Lisbon, with about 20 to 25 on probationary status at any given time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEggert said DOC surveyed all prisons after we contacted her and found that none had given inmates any raises or eliminated lower probationary rates like New Lisbon did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the higher pay rate is limited to the relatively few working inmates at one prison, and only applies to their first two months on the job.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeil said Walker has raised the pay of working inmates, &quot;but we don&#39;t raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions.&quot; Neither group, however, has received a pay raise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe pay rate at one prison is now higher for new workers during their two-month probation period, but that was done not to give inmates raises but to save money for taxpayers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince Beil&rsquo;s statement has only an element of truth, and leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-16T15:29:07.177123", "ruling_date": "2012-08-19T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin Gov.
