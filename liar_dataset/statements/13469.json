Many presidents in the past have put their assets in a <a href=\"http://congressionalresearch.com/RS21656/document.php\">blind trust</a>, which is when an independent trustee manages another person&rsquo;s assets without the person&rsquo;s input.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Trump doesn&rsquo;t actually have to do any of this because the financial conflict-of-interest laws don&rsquo;t apply to him as president, said former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is reportedly on the short list for a seat on Trump&rsquo;s cabinet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, first of all, you realize that those laws don&#39;t apply to the president, right?&quot; Giuliani told <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1611/13/sotu.01.html\">CNN&rsquo;s Jake Tapper Nov. 13</a>. &quot;So, the president doesn&#39;t have to have a blind trust. For some reason, when the law was written, the president was exempt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giuliani has the law pretty much right. Trump, as president, has no legal obligation to detach himself from his businesses and financial interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law at issue is <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/208\">Title 18 Section 208</a> of the U.S. code. It <a href=\"https://www.oge.gov/Web/oge.nsf/Resources/18+U.S.C.+%C2%A7+208:+Acts+affecting+a+personal+financial+interest\">says</a> federal executive branch employees can&rsquo;t participate in government matters in which they or their immediate family has a financial interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of this law, some federal employees put their investments in a blind trust. This allows them to sidestep the regulation and participate in a matter that might otherwise pose a conflict of interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the president and the vice president, despite being executive branch employees, are exempt. According to <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/202\">the law&rsquo;s definitions</a>, Title 18 Section 208 does not apply to them, nor does it apply to members of Congress or federal judges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It appears that presidents have mostly escaped the normal web of ethics and conflict-of-interest laws,&quot; said Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government accountability watchdog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amey added that presidents are allowed to accept gifts in many cases, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been this way since at least 1974, when the <a href=\"http://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/olc/092074.pdf\">Justice Department issued a letter</a> saying Title 18 Section 208 did not apply to the president. Congress expressly codified the exemptions in 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1974 letter, the Justice Department said the legislative history of this conflict-of-interest provision indicated that it was never intended to apply to the president. Additionally, the Justice Department said placing conflict-of-interest laws on the president could constrain him in a potentially unconstitutional manner, though it did not give specific examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As the head of the executive branch, the president may not be able to &mdash; and arguably under the Constitution it might not be possible to require the president to &mdash; recuse from government decisions,&quot; said Richard Briffault, a professor of legislation at Columbia Law School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Title 18 Section 208 is the primary conflict-of-interest provision, there are other relevant rules, including a couple that don&rsquo;t exempt the president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will have to disclose their finances, which is required of all high-level federal employees, Briffault said. But the disclosures are not as detailed as federal tax returns, which Trump has not released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the Constitution&rsquo;s Emoluments Clause, which bans U.S. government employees from accepting presents or compensation from foreign governments, noted Kathleen Clark, an expert on legal ethics and a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump Organization has numerous foreign ties, including <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-foreign-business-entanglements-would-create-unparalleled-conflicts-1478083150\">several overseas</a> real estate deals with possible foreign government connections. <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/pm-erdogan-heralds-new-istanbul-airport.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=18877&amp;NewsCatID=345\">In 2012</a>, for example, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended a ribbon cutting ceremony for Trump Towers Mall in Istanbul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If any of Trump&rsquo;s business arrangements involve the receipt of payments from foreign governments, I believe that he, or his entities from which he receives money, would have to forgo those payments, or he would have to detach from those entities,&quot; Clark said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&#39;s not fully clear that presidents are&nbsp;bound by the Emoluments Clause, and no court has weighed into answer this question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way the clause is constructred &mdash; &nbsp;that it&nbsp;doesn&#39;t specify the president,&nbsp;unlike other provisions in&nbsp;the Constitution, for example&nbsp;&mdash; and the fact that President George Washington himself took gifts from the French government without asking Congress for permission, together make a good case that it doesn&#39;t apply to presidents,&nbsp;said <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/11/17/would-trumps-foreign-business-ties-be-constitutional/constitutional-restrictions-on-foreign-gifts-dont-apply-to-presidents\">Seth Barrett Tillman</a>, a professor at Maynooth University in Ireland who has studied the clause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giuliani said financial conflict-of-interest &quot;laws don&#39;t apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn&#39;t have to have a blind trust.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The president is, in fact, exempt from the primary conflict-of-interest provision in the U.S. code. So presidents do not have any legal obligation to put their financial holdings in a blind trust or to detach themselves from their financial interests in any way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As president, Trump will have to comply with financial disclosure requirements, however, and it&#39;s possible he is constrained by a clause in the Constitution regarding income from foreign governments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Giuliani&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Update&nbsp;Jan. 12, 2017: We have updated this story to add more information about the Emoluments Clause.
