Wisconsin Democrat Herb Kohl voted yes.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold&rsquo;s campaign responded to the ad the same day, issuing <a href=\"http://russfeingold.com/press-releases/rfw-statement-latest-attack-ad-pro-johnson-super-pac/\">a statement saying</a> Feingold voted no because the bill contained &quot;unrelated riders.&quot; The statement included this excerpt from his book, &quot;While America Sleeps&quot;:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Using the same tactics as the drafters of the Patriot Act, the backers knew they could grab a victory on some unrelated agenda because the overall bill was what was known in Washington as a must-pass. Such bills, which Congress has almost no choice but to pass, often attract riders like the one that restricted employees&rsquo; rights. The Bush administration and the Republicans in the Senate, hungry to regain the majority, pounced with some gusto on the political opportunities this new climate of fear provided.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let America Work didn&rsquo;t respond to our requests for information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let America Work says Feingold was the &quot;only senator to vote against Homeland Security.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold was one of nine senators who voted against the 2002 law that created the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.&nbsp;</p> <a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2c31c975-5786-4d07-9306-44d8e26f327f\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2c31c975-5786-4d07-9306-44d8e26f327f</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-19T21:32:12.214837", "ruling_date": "2016-09-21T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "PAC wrongly claims Russ Feingold was only vote against Homeland Security Department", "ruling_headline_slug": "pac-wrongly-claims-russ-feingold-was-only-vote-aga", "ruling_link_text": "Except for the eight other senators ...", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, Let America Work &quot;Senator Tough Guy&quot; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6u1rNLXmN8&amp;feature=youtu.be\">TV ad</a>, Sept. 1, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Senate, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00249\">roll call vote</a> on H.R. 5005 (Homeland Security Act of 2002 )</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/20/politics/20HOME.html\">&quot;Senate Votes, 90-9, to Set Up Homeland Security Department Geared to Fight Terrorism,&quot;</a> Nov. 20, 2002</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russ Feingold campaign, statement, Sept. 1, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Russ Feingold campaign spokesman Michael Tyler, Sept. 8, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 3696, "last_name": "Let America Work", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "let-america-work", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mugs_mug-independentgroup__________________.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3696/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://letamericawork.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Russ Feingold was the &quot;only senator to vote against Homeland Security.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a TV ad", "statement_date": "2016-09-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 132, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/132/", "subject": "Homeland Security", "subject_slug": "homeland-security", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "Russ ", "half_true_count": 7, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 528, "last_name": "Feingold", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "russ-feingold", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Russ_Feingold_Pfact_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/528/", "total_count": 23, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://www.progressivesunited.org/about/russ-feingold"}], "twitter_headline": "PAC wrongly claims Russ Feingold was only vote against Homeland Security Department."}
