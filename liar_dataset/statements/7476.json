Rick Scott has tried to portray himself as a pal of teachers and families who rely on public education. He talks often about how he boosted education spending in 2012 and this year proposed giving teachers a $2,500 pay raise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot surprisingly, his Democratic foes emphasize different facts and figures about education spending -- including how Scott oversaw a spending cut in 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs Scott prepared to deliver his State of the State speech March 5, the Democrats &quot;pre-butted&quot; him with a<a href=\"http://www.floridadems.org/newsroom/pressrelease/fl-dems-rick-scott-state-state-nothing-more-state-denial\"> press release</a> the day before attacking his record on jobs, tax cuts and education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Scott, the hardcore tea party conservative who spent <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-young/florida-medicaid_b_2439605.html\">$5 million of his own money</a> to defeat the Affordable Care Act and who slashed education funding by<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/gubernatorial/gov-rick-scott-signs-70-billion-state-budget-after-1427-million-in-vetoes/1225440\"> $1.3 billion</a>, calling it not a &lsquo;<a href=\"http://jacksonville.com/news/florida/2011-02-07/story/rick-scotts-budget-plan-calls-deep-cuts\">core function</a>&rsquo; of the state, is now arguing for investments in education and the expansion of Medicaid under the President&rsquo;s health care law,&quot; wrote the Florida Democratic Party.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEducation sounds like a fairly basic government service or a &quot;core function.&quot; Did Scott call education not a &quot;core function&quot; of the state? &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Scott and the use of the word &quot;core&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo support their claim, Democrats pointed to a February 2011 article in Jacksonville&rsquo;s<a href=\"http://jacksonville.com/news/florida/2011-02-07/story/rick-scotts-budget-plan-calls-deep-cuts\"> <em>Florida Times-Union</em></a> about Scott&rsquo;s first budget proposal, which called for steep cuts to much of the budget, including education, benefits for state workers, and state jobs. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe article quoted Scott at a Tallahassee press conference: &quot;The public expects us to get back to what the core functions of the state are, not things that would be nice but we don&#39;t have the money for.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida Democratic Party spokesman Eric Conrad told PolitiFact Florida that Scott was talking about returning to the &quot;core functions&quot; of the state while also broadly cutting education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s kind of hard to think he considers education to be a core function if he was cutting that much money from it,&quot; Conrad said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we found no place where Scott specifically mentioned education and said it was not a &quot;core function&quot; of government. Instead, Scott talked about the core functions of government in a much more general way, saying only core functions should receive funding.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere are some excerpts from Scott&rsquo;s comments on core functions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile unveiling his proposed budget at a<a href=\"http://www.flgov.com/governor-scott-unveils-floridas-first-jobs-budget-before-a-capacity-crowd-in-eustis/\"> tea party rally</a> in Eustis on Feb. 7, 2011, Scott said, &quot;The fact is that government has to get back to its core functions. But only its core functions.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLater in the speech, when talking about streamlining state agencies, Scott said: &quot;And, by eliminating programs that are not core government functions, remember we are going to go back to what the core function is, not a lot of &lsquo;it would be nice to have,&rsquo; just like, that&rsquo;s not what you get to do right now, we are going to go back to core functions, it will save us another $150 million over two years.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott did mention education in another part of his speech, saying that he would cut &quot;over $4 billion in taxes over the next two years without any cuts out of state general revenue for education, zero cuts out of state general revenue for education.&quot; Actually, state funding for education shrank that year, as we noted in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/feb/08/rick-scott/education-cuts-show-rick-scotts-budget/\">2011 fact-check</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Scott called for selling the state airplane in February 2011, he <a href=\"http://www.flgov.com/2011/02/11/governor-rick-scott-accepts-bids-for-state-airplanes-saving-floridians-millions-of-dollars/\">said</a>: &quot;Burdening taxpayers with these ongoing expenses is irresponsible and not a core function for government to meet the state&#39;s critical needs.&quot; (Scott earned a<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/promises/scott-o-meter/promise/729/sell-the-state-plane/\"> Promise Kept</a> on PolitiFact Florida&rsquo;s Scott-O-Meter which keeps track of his promises.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn April 2011, Scott was interviewed on Fox Business News and talked about eliminating teacher tenure and watching how we spend every dollar. Then he said: &quot;We go back to core functions. All of these things are important and we&#39;re going to get them -- we&#39;re going to get them done.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA spokesperson for Scott did not directly address our questions about Scott&rsquo;s views on what is a &quot;core function.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The governor has always said he is focused on three things: jobs, education and cost of living,&quot; said Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz in an email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Florida Democratic Party said in a press release that Scott called education &quot;not a &lsquo;core function&rsquo; of the state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Democrats point to Scott&rsquo;s 2011 comments about his budget proposal that included massive and wide-ranging cuts -- including to education. Scott called for focusing on &quot;core functions&quot; of the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott cut the education budget in a year when he talked about funding for &quot;core functions.&quot; But he never specifically said education was not a &quot;core function.&quot; It&rsquo;s a stretch and a leap of logic for Florida Democrats to claim otherwise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-05T14:15:00.066312", "ruling_date": "2013-03-05T16:32:25", "ruling_headline": "Florida Democrats say Rick Scott says education is not a 'core function' of state government", "ruling_headline_slug": "florida-democrats-say-rick-scott-says-education-no", "ruling_link_text": "Evidence by omission", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tFlorida Democratic Party, <a href=\"http://www.floridadems.org/newsroom/pressrelease/fl-dems-rick-scott-state-state-nothing-more-state-denial\">&quot;FL Dems: Rick Scott&rsquo;s State of the State Nothing more than a State of Denial,&quot;</a> March 4, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGov.
