In other words we&#39;re reducing your taxes from 35 percent to 15 percent. Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. Hillary Clinton&#39;s plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I&#39;m proposing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether a Clinton presidency meant that small businesses would be paying nearly half their income to the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first, a word about small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of us think of small businesses as businesses with a handful of employees, such as the corner grocery store, the local gasoline station or a nearby restaurant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet according to the government&#39;s definition, about <a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40860.pdf\">97 percent</a> of all United States companies are classified as small by the Small Business Administration. In some sectors, you can have 1,500 employees or <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2015-title13-vol1/pdf/CFR-2015-title13-vol1-sec121-104.pdf\">gross income</a> of up to $38.5 million and still be <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/Size_Standards_Table.pdf\">considered a small business</a>. (<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/080515/are-you-considered-small-business.asp\">The IRS</a> has its own set of rules.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked the Trump campaign about the &quot;almost 50 percent&quot; claim, spokesman Dan Kowalski sent us a breakdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently the top tax rate is 39.6 percent. Add 3.8 percent that a business owner could potentially be paying in Medicare taxes and you get 43.4 percent. That&#39;s under the current system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton is proposing a 4 percent surcharge on high earners. That would bring the total tax rate to 47.4 percent, which is where the Trump campaign gets its &quot;almost 50 percent&quot; claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This rate would apply to virtually any small business with substantial income, regardless of industry,&quot; Kowalski said, and he referred us to <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/2000638-an-analysis-of-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals.pdf\">an analysis</a> by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted the center, where senior fellow Roberton Williams said Trump&#39;s percentages were correct, but there&#39;s more to the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That 4 percent tax only applies to taxpayers who have an adjusted gross income of over $5 million. That could be individuals or small business owners who report their business income on their individual tax returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, it would not apply to that first $5 million. Only income in excess of $5 million would be taxed at an extra 4 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surcharge &quot;is not targeted to small business. It&#39;s a wealthy person&#39;s tax,&quot; Williams told us. &quot;To the extent that those people are small business people, you can argue it&#39;s hitting small businessmen. But the bulk of small businesses are not at those income levels.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Robert McIntyre, director of the progressive group Citizens for Tax Justice, said only 34,251 of the 150 million tax returns filed in 2013 reported income of more than $5 million. That&#39;s about 0.02 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And because, in some industries, you are no longer considered a small business when you have more than 100 employees or more than $750,000 in revenue, it&#39;s not known how many of the people in that 0.02 percent would meet the definition of a small business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, in August 2011 the Office of Tax Analysis at the U.S. Treasury Department <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/tax-analysis/Documents/TP-4.pdf\">estimated</a> that only 0.5 percent of small businesses report a profit in excess of $1 million, another indication that the surcharge would only affect a tiny fraction of small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surcharge would not affect corporate tax returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said Clinton&#39;s plan &quot;would tax many small businesses by almost 50 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&#39;s proposal isn&#39;t directed at small businesses. Her surtax is intended to apply to rich individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top tax rate (plus Medicare taxes) would go from the current 43.4 percent to 47.4 percent, but it would only be applied to amounts over $5 million. A mere 0.02 percent of tax returns fall into that category and some of those payers will not be small business owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement has an element of truth but leaves out important details that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.</p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9ad8726d-efef-4ad9-9025-782afbe3a33e\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9ad8726d-efef-4ad9-9025-782afbe3a33e</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-10T17:48:14.468512", "ruling_date": "2016-08-10T17:59:49", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton plan would tax small businesses at nearly 50 percent", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-plan-would-tax-s", "ruling_link_text": "'Many' is fewer than 0.02%", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube.com, &quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Y_aXfUet-Hg?t=13m40s\">Full Event: Donald Trump Full Economic Plan Speech in Detroit, Michigan (August 8, 2016)</a>, Donald Trump Speeches &amp; Events channel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forbes, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevecooper/2012/09/20/the-government-definition-of-small-business-is-b-s/#d65cebc5ef82\">The Government Definition of Small Business is B.S.</a>&quot; Sept. 20, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Research Service, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40860.pdf\">Small Business Size Standards: A Historical Analysis of Contemporary Issues</a>,&quot; Jan. 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Small Business Administration, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/Size_Standards_Table.pdf\">Table of Small Business Size Standards</a>,&quot; effective Feb. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Dan Kowalski, spokesman, Donald Trump campaign, Aug. 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax Policy Center, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/2000638-an-analysis-of-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals.pdf\">An Analysis of Hillary Clinton&#39;s Tax Proposals</a>,&quot; March 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview and email, Roberton C.
