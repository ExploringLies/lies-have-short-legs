Capitalism &amp; competition creates higher wages &amp; better working conditions. #HappyLaborDay.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether it was correct that Henry Ford, rather than unions, should get credit for creating the eight-hour work day and the 40-hour work week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A long struggle</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the United States, a few limited eight-hour-day laws were on the books shortly after the Civil War. One, in Illinois, was passed in 1867, followed in 1868 by a law covering certain classes of federal workers. But neither law was well-enforced, and in most sectors, working hours of 10 to 12 hours were common. So a reduction in the work week became a leading issue for the nascent labor movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The issue came to a head in 1884, after the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions -- a predecessor of today&rsquo;s AFL-CIO -- called for all workers to have eight-hour days by May 1, 1886. When that deadline wasn&rsquo;t met, labor leaders upped the ante by calling for demonstrations. In Chicago, peaceful marches morphed into violence, with an explosion marring a rally at Haymarket Square on May 4, 1886, leaving seven police officers and four workers dead. Subsequent trials, executions and clemencies for the accused made the eight-hour week a top issue nationally and internationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this occurred decades before Ford founded his company in 1903.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ford&rsquo;s move</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1914, at a time when most workers still lacked a guarantee of eight-hour days, the Ford Motor Co. attracted notice for instituting eight-hour shifts and raising wages in the manner the graphic indicates. (For many Ford workers, the work week remained six days.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company&rsquo;s move -- made a dozen years earlier than the graphic said -- was significant, labor historians say. But they add that it&rsquo;s worth noting some caveats. For instance, Ford&rsquo;s &quot; &lsquo;sociological department&rsquo; had to inspect a worker&rsquo;s home to make sure they &lsquo;deserved&rsquo; the $5 first,&quot; said Ileen A. DeVault, a professor of labor relations, law and history at Cornell University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, Ford&rsquo;s policy wasn&rsquo;t law, so it wasn&rsquo;t guaranteed to last indefinitely, even for those who qualified for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It was a unilaterally provided benefit at the discretion of the employer and could be yanked away whenever the cost exceeded profits,&quot; said Robert Bruno, a professor with the University of Illinois School of Labor and Employment Relations. Companies that operated this way, Bruno said, often revoked these policies when the Great Depression hit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The endgame</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ford&rsquo;s initiative was not widely copied overnight. In 1916, the federal government passed an act to require an eight-hour day and overtime pay for railroad workers, but most workers still didn&rsquo;t have those protections, and working hours remained a hotly contested issue. &quot;Demands for the five-day week began to proliferate in 1919, a year in which 4 million American&nbsp;workers went out on strike,&quot; said Priscilla Murolo, a professor of history at Sarah Lawrence College. &quot;That was about 20 percent of the industrial labor force.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took President Franklin D. Roosevelt&rsquo;s signing of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 for all workers to see limits on working hours -- initially 44 hours a week, then phased to 42 and eventually 40 by 1940. &quot;When the FLSA was passed in 1938, Saturday working hours were still common,&quot; DeVault said. &quot;Saturday noon was the most frequent &lsquo;payday&rsquo; time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given this history, Ford is best described as an early adopter of today&rsquo;s familiar working hours, experts said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That happened more than 60 years after workers, through their unions, began organizing for an eight-hour day in the 1860s,&quot; said David Bensman, a professor at Rutgers University&#39;s School of Management and Labor Relations. &quot;When Ford adopted the eight-hour day for his factory, he was responding to a working force that had been demanding the eight-hour day for a long time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other experts agreed that labor unions, rather than Ford, deserve the primary credit for today&rsquo;s working-hour schedule -- including Matt Anderson, curator of transportation at the Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, Mich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Henry Ford was an early proponent of the five-day week, but the American Federation of Labor fought for it to be adopted more widely via contract negotiations,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;Unions absolutely deserve much credit for the reform.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A viral image said that Henry Ford, not unions, created the eight-hour work day and the five-day work week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ford does deserve credit for adopting shorter working shifts, but he was hardly the first employer to do this, and the now-standard working schedule did not become federal law -- and thus a right for all workers -- until almost a quarter-century after Ford&rsquo;s move. Meanwhile, experts said, unions do deserve credit for keeping the working-hours issue alive, at significant personal sacrifice, for 70 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-09-09T12:13:33.457330", "ruling_date": "2015-09-09T15:54:27", "ruling_headline": "Does the 8-hour day and the 40-hour week come from Henry Ford, or labor unions?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-8-hour-day-and-40-hour-come-henry-ford-or-lab", "ruling_link_text": "Unions played a much bigger role", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Shareable graphic, received by PolitiFact Sept. 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Labor, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/history/flsa1938.htm\">Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938: Maximum Struggle for a Minimum Wage</a>,&quot; accessed Sept. 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/where-did-40-hour-workweek-come-n192276\">Where Did the 40-Hour Workweek Come From?</a>&quot; Sept. 1, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Illinois Labor History Society, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.illinoislaborhistory.org/haymarket/the-story-of-the-haymarket-affair.html\">The Haymarket Affair</a>,&quot; accessed Sept. 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>History.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ford-factory-workers-get-40-hour-week\">Ford factory workers get 40-hour week</a>,&quot; accessed Sept. 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California-Santa Barbara, Sept. 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with David Bensman, professor at Rutgers University&#39;s School of Management and Labor Relations, Sept. 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Robert Bruno, professor with the University of Illinois School of Labor and Employment Relations, Sept. 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Priscilla Murolo, professor of history at Sarah Lawrence College, Sept. 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Ileen A.
