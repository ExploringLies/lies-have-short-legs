Crossing the waterway sets motorists paying cash back $12.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor some New Jerseyans, commuting to work in New York costs more than they pay in New Jersey income taxes, according to Assemblyman John Wisniewski, a Democrat from Middlesex County.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There&#39;s one statistic that says if you&#39;re earning under $100,000 a year and you commute to New York every day you pay more to the Port Authority in tolls than you pay to the state of New Jersey in income tax,&quot; Wisniewski, the chairman of the state Democratic Party, said in a YouTube video posted on April 13. &quot;That&#39;s outrageous and that&#39;s got to be changed.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey found Wisniewski&rsquo;s statement is accurate because people who earn all of their income from wages in New York won&rsquo;t pay New Jersey income taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisniewski said his statement refers to a married couple with children. When the assemblyman&rsquo;s office initially calculated the statistic it was based on a couple who earned $80,000 a year and had two children and one partner commuted to work in New York, using E-ZPass and taking two weeks of vacation, according to Tim O&rsquo;Donovan, Wisniewski&rsquo;s communication director.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut a broad group of commuters pay more tolls than New Jersey income taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey residents who work in New York file tax returns with both states. New Jersey provides a credit that varies depending on income to residents for taxes paid to New York.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAny resident who only has income from wages in New York &quot;will always get a full credit,&quot; said Neil Becourtney, a certified public accountant and tax partner at J.H. Cohn LLP&rsquo;s Roseland office. &quot;They will end up with no New Jersey income tax.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRon West, professor of taxation and law at Fairleigh Dickinson University, noted that if income is earned in New Jersey and New York, there &quot;could be a situation where the credit will not fully offset the New Jersey tax and there would be something owed.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, even if residents owe nothing to New Jersey, West said, &quot;they&rsquo;re paying tax, but New Jersey is not getting their hands on it.&quot; &nbsp;Instead, New York is.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor example, a married couple who earns $100,000 combined would owe New York more than $5,000 in income taxes, factoring in personal exemptions but no other deductions. Had that income been earned in New Jersey, the couple would owe roughly $2,600.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe credit offsets the couple&rsquo;s New Jersey taxes. So, they owe nothing to their home state, but they still pay New York taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tO&rsquo;Donovan said Wisniewski&rsquo;s office also looked at what residents would owe New Jersey without the credit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy that measure, a married couple with a taxable income of less than $94,950 would pay more in tolls than taxes if one partner commuted every weekday using E-ZPass. The same applies for an individual with a taxable income of less than $71,750.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDriving to New York five days a week, 52 weeks a year, would cost an E-ZPass user $2,470 in tolls annually. Cash users would pay $3,120. Annual toll costs drop about $100 with two weeks&rsquo; vacation taken.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you&#39;re earning under $100,000 a year and you commute to New York every day you pay more to the Port Authority in tolls than you pay to the state of New Jersey in income tax,&quot; Wisniewski said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf New Jersey residents earn all their income from wages in New York, they would owe New Jersey nothing because a credit offsets their tax liability.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey&rsquo;d still pay income taxes to New York, but Wisniewski specifically said taxes paid to New Jersey.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this story, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/politifact_nj_john_wisniewski.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-19T16:44:39.801663", "ruling_date": "2012-04-23T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "John Wisniewski claims some New Jersey commuters pay more in tolls than state income taxes", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-wisniewski-claims-some-new-jersey-commuters-p", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, but still paying to New York", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNew Jersey Assembly Democrats&rsquo; YouTube Account, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7Rb_lbVZuQ&amp;feature=digest_sun\">Assembly Transportation Committee Members on Authorizing Use of Subpoena Powers on Port Authority</a>, April 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPort Authority of New York and New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.panynj.gov/bridges-tunnels/tolls.html\">Bridges &amp; Tunnels: Tolls</a>, accessed April 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Tim O&rsquo;Donovan, communications director for <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/members/bio.asp?Leg=160\">Assemblyman John Wisniewski</a>, April 17 and 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/members/bio.asp?Leg=160\">Assemblyman John Wisniewski</a>, April 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Ron West, professor of taxation and law at <a href=\"http://inside.fdu.edu/profile/ron_west.html\">Fairleigh Dickinson University</a>, April 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Neil Becourtney, certified public accountant with and tax partner at <a href=\"http://www.jhcohn.com/Default.aspx\">J.H.
