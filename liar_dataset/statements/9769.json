One of those, Sierra Guyton, who was wounded in a playground shooting, later died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flynn said getting firearms off the streets is a focus of his department&rsquo;s efforts and then offered a statement that you don&rsquo;t hear often when it comes to crime -- how efforts in Milwaukee compare favorably to New York City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As of July 6th, the New York City Police Department had confiscated approximately 1,350 firearms from the streets of a city of 9 million,&quot; the chief said. &quot;So far this year, the Milwaukee Police Department in a city of 600,000 -- 15 times smaller than New York -- has seized 1,340 firearms from the streets of this city.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are Milwaukee cops keeping pace with the NYPD when it comes to gun seizures?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A visit from NYC brass</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Flynn made the claim, New York&rsquo;s numbers were top-of-mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Several NYPD executive level commanders were sent to Milwaukee by Commissioner (William) Bratton to study a variety of topics, including our methods of crime control, community relations, and accountability systems,&quot; said Lt. Mark Stanmeyer, Milwaukee Police Department spokesman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the visit coincided with the day of the shooting and Flynn&rsquo;s next-day news conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the topic of gun seizures was discussed at the get-together, New York officials said they had seized 1,350 firearms as of July 6, 2014, according to Stanmeyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MPD officials saw that figure nearly matched theirs -- 1,347 seizures as of July 24, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, the MIlwaukee figure included an extra two-plus weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Flynn had a talking point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked New York Police Department officials about guns seized, they were not able to provide the number for July 6, 2014 that was used by Flynn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But their data tracked with the figure Flynn used &nbsp;-- 1,289 firearms had been seized as of June 8, 2014 and 1,881 had been seized as of Aug. 10, 2014, according to department spokeswoman Sophia Mason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get the comparison on the same time frame, the Milwaukee figure was 1,460 as of Aug. 10, 2014. In 2013, the department seized 1,921 guns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&rsquo;t believe the point the Chief was making about the population/gun recovery ratio is lost,&quot; Stanmeyer said in an email. &quot;Even using the August 10 data, they only have 421 more guns with 7.7 million more people.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also noted that the Milwaukee figure does not include 353 firearms turned in during a <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/milwaukee-gun-buyback-brings-in-steady-flow-of-firearms-b99272528z1-259668531.html\">&nbsp;gun buyback program last spring</a> that was led by faith leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what&rsquo;s the explanation for the similar numbers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, in New York the number of guns seized is down compared with last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bratton said in a June 10, 2014 report on <a href=\"http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/06/8546897/bratton-explains-temporary-increase-shootings\">Capitalnewyork.com</a> that the number &quot;in some respects is reflective of the fact that crime is continuing to go down.&quot; The numbers of murders, rapes and robberies also are lower than a year ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;ve had an increase, a temporary increase, in shootings. ... Crime goes up, it goes down,&quot; Bratton said in the article. &quot;It&rsquo;s always going to go up at some point in time. We&rsquo;ll always have the ability to push it down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another factor could be at work in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Mayor Bill de Blasio <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/nyregion/de-blasio-stop-and-frisk.html\">promised to reform</a> the department&rsquo;s long-standing and controversial stop-and-frisk policy where cops can detain, question and search people suspected of crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even before de Blasio took office in January 2014, the number of stop and frisk stops had <a href=\"http://bigapplewonk.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/chart_3-3.png\">dropped sharply in the past two years.</a> Law enforcement officials told the <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2014/01/28/nyc-sees-33-percent-spike-in-murders/\">New York Post </a>that such stops can be effective in obtaining illegal firearms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flynn said his department&rsquo;s gun seizures, through a mid-year point, were about to those of &nbsp;much-larger New York City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York&rsquo;s numbers may be down a bit this year, so other factors may be at work. But Flynn&rsquo;s claim didn&rsquo;t get into the reasons why.
