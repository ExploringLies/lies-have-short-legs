They&rsquo;re all made in China,&quot; Perez said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No doubt, many Trump products are made overseas, a point the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has acknowledged in debates and interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perez went a few leaps beyond that in saying all Trump products are made in China. So we checked to see whether the secretary is right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Perez&rsquo;s office for the source of his information. Mattie Munoz, his press secretary at the Department of Labor, said that since his comments were made on private time during a political event, she couldn&rsquo;t comment. She suggested contacting Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s presidential campaign, which in turn forwarded our request to the Democratic Party of Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emily Bolton, a state Democratic Party spokeswoman, said she couldn&rsquo;t comment on Perez&rsquo;s statement but sent us links to a series of articles about Trump products that are made overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we set out on our own window-shopping spree, eying items listed on The Trump Organization&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.trump.com\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>website</u></a> and searching for where they are manufactured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that many Trump items are made in China, including cuff links, sport coats, shirts, eyeglasses, lamps and mirrors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to get an exact read on what percentage of items are from China, because many items don&rsquo;t disclose their exact origin. Some listed on Amazon.com and other shopping websites merely say that they&rsquo;re &quot;imported.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We emailed the Trump campaign twice to see what percentage of his products are made in China but didn&rsquo;t get a response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China isn&rsquo;t the only country that makes Trump products. The billionaire candidate acknowledged during a June 21 <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-responds-hillary-clintons-charges-outsourcing-products/story?id=40020692\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview</u></a> on ABC that his company manufactures neckties in China, suits in Mexico, furniture in Turkey, and barware in Slovenia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that some Trump ties were made in Indonesia and Vietnam in addition to China. Many Trump shirts were made in Bangladesh, and some sport coats were made in India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering, some Trump products also are made in the U.S., including the candidate&rsquo;s iconic &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; baseball cap, which is manufactured in California. PunditFact gave a Pants on Fire rating in October to a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/07/tweets/tweets-say-donald-trumps-make-america-great-again-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>claim</u></a> made by Twitter users that the hats were made in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some other Trump products that we found are manufactured in the U.S.:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;bedding comforters, advertised as being &quot;master suite worthy&quot;;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;cologne, called &quot;Success by Trump&quot;;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Trump Natural Spring Water, served at Trump facilities. It&rsquo;s bottled in Willington, Conn. by the Village Springs water company; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;Trump Wine, made on a 1,300-acre estate near Charlottesville. A <a href=\"http://www.trumpwinery.com/legal/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>disclaimer</u></a> on the winery website says the GOP presidential candidate doesn&rsquo;t personally own the winery, which is run by his son, Eric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also found a few Trump suits online that were made in the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has said he&rsquo;d like to make more products domestically, but the U.S. &nbsp;can&rsquo;t compete with foreign countries that &quot;manipulate their currencies&quot; to reduce manufacturing costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s overseas product lines have become a central campaign issue for Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. In a June 21 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-_C3X8Nf70\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>speech</u></a>, she accused the GOP candidate of hypocrisy for outsourcing his own products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perez said Trump&rsquo;s products are &quot;all made in China.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s an element of truth to his statement in that Trump clearly relies on China to produce many products -- ties, shirts, cuff links, sport coats, jackets, lamps, eyeglasses and mirrors. That buttresses the labor secretary&rsquo;s broader point that Trump relies on foreign labor to produce much of his product line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Perez goes too far in saying all of Trump&rsquo;s products are made in China. They come from a lot of other places as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his hyperbolic claim statement Mostly False.</p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/53f7cb21-360f-4c93-873a-a05fbad270f5\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/53f7cb21-360f-4c93-873a-a05fbad270f5</a> \r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-26T22:46:46.465558", "ruling_date": "2016-06-27T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tom Perez erroneously tags all Trump products with 'Made in China' label", "ruling_headline_slug": "tom-perez-erroneously-tags-all-trump-products-made", "ruling_link_text": "An overstatement", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Labor Secretary Thomas Perez&rsquo;s comments to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, June 18, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-_C3X8Nf70\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>speech</u></a> in Columbus, Ohio, June 21, 2016.
