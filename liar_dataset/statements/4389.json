Rick Perry&rsquo;s years-ago switch from the Democratic to the Republican party Puts him in the same company as the nation&rsquo;s 40th president.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;You&rsquo;re sort of like Ronald Reagan, you feel the Democratic Party left you?&quot; Hannity asked.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry replied that he&rsquo;d had a conversation with Reagan&rsquo;s son Michael, a political consultant and former radio host. &quot;I told Michael Reagan the other day &hellip; &lsquo;You know, I love your dad, and he was part of the reason I became a Republican,&rsquo; but I said, &lsquo;I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry and Hannity shared a laugh over that. But that light moment left unresolved how old each leader was when he made his D-to-R leap. Did Perry beat Reagan to the flip point?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll take a look at Reagan first. In March 2010, PolitiFact Florida rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/mar/30/charlie-crist/crist-says-reagan-was-democrat-converting-gop/\">True</a> the claim that &quot;Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHistorian Edward Yager, author of the 2006 biography <em>Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s Journey: Democrat to Republican</em>, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan, who was born Feb. 6, 1911, &quot;was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for (Democrat Franklin Roosevelt) in 1932, when he was 21.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYager said that he hadn&rsquo;t seen copies of Reagan&rsquo;s voter registration cards but that &quot;virtually all the sources that refer to&quot; Reagan&rsquo;s party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat. Yager also noted that Reagan &quot;has two autobiographies in which he refers to his voting for (Roosevelt) four times&quot; and then for President Harry Truman, a Democrat, in 1948.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLater, while still a Democrat, Reagan began supporting Republican presidential candidates. Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at Reagan&rsquo;s presidential library, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan endorsed the presidential candidacies of Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 &mdash; at ages 41 and 45, respectively &mdash; and Republican Richard Nixon in 1960 &quot;while remaining a Democrat.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry and other Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to debate at the Reagan library, in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 7.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe library&rsquo;s website says Reagan registered as a Republican in the fall of 1962, when he was 51. According to the site, a woman interrupted Reagan while he was speaking in favor of Nixon&rsquo;s unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in California to ask him whether he had yet to register as a Republican. &quot;When he said, &lsquo;Well, no, I haven&rsquo;t yet, but I intend to,&rsquo; down the center aisle through the audience came a woman who declared, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a registrar,&rsquo; and placed a registration card in front of him,&quot; the site says. &quot;In front of his audience, Ronald Reagan officially joined the Republican Party.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn her 2010 email to PolitiFact Florida, Giller pointed to the famous Reagan quip that Hannity echoed on his show: &quot;I didn&#39;t leave the Democratic Party. The party left me.&#39;&#39;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOther studies of Reagan also trace his party switch to 1962, including Yager&rsquo;s book and a 1982 Reagan biography by Lou Cannon, which says Reagan &quot;was an active Democrat&quot; in 1952, when he married Nancy Davis, &quot;and would remain a registered Democrat for another decade.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 1962, Cannon writes, when Reagan was approached by California Republicans to help campaign on their behalf, he told them that he &quot;didn&rsquo;t want to be a professional Democrat campaigning for the Republicans&quot; and would re-register as a Republican. &quot;He did so, at a subsequent political meeting where he spoke on behalf of the ill-fated Nixon campaign against Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown,&quot; Cannon writes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, by several accounts, Reagan was 51 when he became a Republican, although he began backing GOP presidential candidates a decade earlier.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHow old was Perry, born March 4, 1950, when he made his move?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve looked at Perry&rsquo;s political past in <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/jan/16/debra-medina/debra-medina-claims-rick-perry-was-democrat-and-al/\">previous</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/aug/15/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-rick-perry-was-al-gores-campaign-cha/\">fact-checks</a>, reporting that Perry won his first election as a Democrat, taking a West Texas House district seat in 1984, when Democrats controlled the Legislature and the state had had just one Republican governor since Reconstruction.
