Ted Cruz<a href=\"http://therightscoop.com/watch-online-ted-cruz-speaks-at-the-texas-gop-convention-now/\"> declared at the Republican Party of Texas convention</a> as he took fierce issue with an Obama administration<a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf\"> letter to public schools</a> distributed the day before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the May 13, 2016, letter, federal agencies cited a decades-old federal law barring discrimination in educational settings as the basis for telling school superintendents nationally to let transgender students use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz, fresh off his bid for president, told delegates: &quot;The president issued a decree to every public school in America demanding that they change their bathroom policies, demanding that every public school now allow grown men and boys into little girls&rsquo; bathrooms. We have entered the world of politically correct lunacy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Cruz accurately sum up the Obama directive?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To our emailed request for the basis of Cruz&rsquo;s statement, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack said only: &quot;By the very text of the directive you linked, anyone in a public school, whether they are students or adults (which includes adult 18-year old students), would be able to enter any restroom.&quot; Novack also accurately noted the guidance <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-administration-to-instruct-schools-to-accommodate-transgender-students/2016/05/12/0ed1c50e-18ab-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html\">also applies to colleges</a> that accept federal aid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Obama administration letter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked a Department of Education spokeswoman, Dorie Nolt, if the directive, particularly the portion on access to restrooms and locker rooms, would also apply to adults in schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, Nolt replied: &quot;Our guidance is related to students.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For our part, we noticed that the letter in question doesn&rsquo;t tell schools to let men into girls&rsquo; restrooms; it doesn&rsquo;t say anything about adults in public schools. And its language about students is focused on transgender boys and girls whose gender identity doesn&rsquo;t match their sex assignment at birth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The eight-page letter from the U.S. departments of Justice and Education tells school districts to be compliant with <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/overview-title-ix-education-amendments-1972-20-usc-1681-et-seq\">Title IX</a> protections against sex discrimination by allowing students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms of the gender they identify with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The letter, also affecting says the agencies are offering &quot;significant guidance&quot; on policies related to transgender students in relation to athletics, housing and overnight accommodations and education records, among areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In regard to restrooms and locker rooms, the letter states:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:45pt\">&quot;A school may provide separate facilities on the basis of sex, but must allow transgender students access to such facilities consistent with their gender identity. A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so. A school may, however, make individual-user options available to all students who voluntarily seek additional privacy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Defining transgender</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what qualifies as &quot;transgender&quot;? Here&rsquo;s how the Obama administration letter defines it: &quot;Transgender describes those individuals whose gender identity is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. A transgender male is someone who identifies as male but was assigned the sex of female at birth; a transgender female is someone who identifies as female but was assigned the sex of male at birth.&quot; The letter defines gender identity as &quot;an individual&rsquo;s internal sense of gender. A person&rsquo;s gender identity may be different from or the same as the person&rsquo;s sex assigned at birth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The<a href=\"http://www.transequality.org/about\"> National Center for Transgender Equality</a>, a social justice advocacy organization for transgender people, says a transgender individual<a href=\"http://transequality.org/issues/resources/transgender-terminology\"> is a</a> person whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth. Otherwise, the<a href=\"http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx\"> American Psychological Association</a> defines transgender as &quot;an umbrella term for persons whose gender identity, gender expression or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then again, there are professionals who dispute such definitions. For instance, Paul McHugh, a psychiatrist formerly at Johns Hopkins University, said in a June 12, 2014, Wall Street Journal<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/paul-mchugh-transgender-surgery-isnt-the-solution-1402615120\"> commentary</a>: &quot;At the heart of the problem is confusion over the nature of the transgendered. &lsquo;Sex change&rsquo; is biologically impossible,&quot; McHugh said. &quot;People who undergo sex-reassignment surgery do not change from men to women or vice versa. Rather, they become feminized men or masculinized women. Claiming that this is civil-rights matter and encouraging surgical intervention is in reality to collaborate with and promote a mental disorder.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bathroom debate</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Debate over whether a transgender person should use the bathroom aligning with his or her gender identity or gender assigned at birth picked up steam after North Carolina lawmakers in March 2016 passed a measure into<a href=\"http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015E2/Bills/House/PDF/H2v4.pdf\"> law</a> requiring people to use the bathroom corresponding with the gender on their birth certificate in public multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Texas in April 2016, the superintendent of the Fort Worth Independent School District, Kent Scribner, approved bathroom policy guidelines Scribner described as a call to meet the needs of the district&rsquo;s transgender students. Then on May 9, 2016, Lt. Gov Dan Patrick<a href=\"https://www.ltgov.state.tx.us/2016/05/09/lt-gov-patrick-asks-fort-worth-isd-parents-to-speak-out-against-unilateral-action-of-superintendent/\"> called for</a> the superintendent to resign. Less than a week later, the Education and Justice departments sent their letter, which was met with a <a href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/files/epress/files/2016/complaint_FM.pdf\">lawsuit</a>, filed May 25, 2016, against the administration by Texas and 10 other states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz said Obama issued a decree &quot;demanding that every public school now allow grown men and boys into the little girls&rsquo; bathroom.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal agencies told schools to let transgender students use the restrooms corresponding to their gender identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet that letter of guidance says nothing about grown men or other adults, leaving this claim with just an element of truth provided you believe, as Cruz apparently does, that a transgender person born a boy remains a boy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY FALSE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"> more</a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-24T19:20:40.006835", "ruling_date": "2016-06-26T12:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ted Cruz makes Mostly False claim about Obama directing men and boys into girls' bathrooms", "ruling_headline_slug": "ted-cruz-makes-mostly-false-claim-about-obama-dire", "ruling_link_text": "Is a boy always a boy?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Video,<a href=\"http://therightscoop.com/watch-online-ted-cruz-speaks-at-the-texas-gop-convention-now/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>Ted Cruz Speaks at the Texas GOP Convention</u>!</a>, The Right Scoop, May 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Letter,<a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students</u></a>, U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Education, May 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1knlw1Cn2SjoZcoPd3p4GO1vOAHty9tRwmyA5aVhm0to/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Emails</u></a>, Phil Novack, press secretary for U.S. Sen.
