According to Meleca&rsquo;s figures, the bills with bipartisan support represent just over 79 percent of the total bills passed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeleca said the Senate clerk&rsquo;s office provided the figures and Vincent Keeran, the Senate clerk, confirmed the figures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBills were considered to have bipartisan support if the majority of Senate Democrats supported the legislation, Keeran said. With 10 Democratic senators, that means bills must have received at least six Democratic votes to be considered bipartisan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSenate Democratic Leader Eric Kearney&rsquo;s office did not dispute the figures. But a spokesman for Kearney said Democrats were not always included in shaping high-profile bills, such as Senate Bill 5, the attempt to restrict public employees&rsquo; collective bargaining power.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;A lot of the really important ones they push through probably didn&rsquo;t&quot; have bipartisan support, said Kearney spokesman Mike Rowe.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRowe&rsquo;s point is well taken &ndash; SB 5, for example, received zero Democratic votes &ndash; but Niehaus did not claim bipartisanship on specific bills.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNiehaus&rsquo; claim was that more than 80 percent of the bills the Senate passed had bipartisan support. The actual numbers showed about 79 percent had bipartisan support. But while Niehaus didn&rsquo;t hit the number on the nose, the driving point behind his claim certainly is accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe senator&rsquo;s point was that the two parties worked together and avoided gridlock.And since the threshold for bipartisanship is that a majority of Democrats support the bill, there clearly was bipartisan support for a significant amount of legislation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, Niehaus&rsquo; claim rates True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-01-16T18:43:51.093159", "ruling_date": "2013-01-17T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tom Niehaus says 80 percent of the bills passed last Ohio Senate session were carried by bipartisan votes", "ruling_headline_slug": "tom-niehaus-says-80-percent-bills-passed-last-ohio", "ruling_link_text": "Figure off a smidge, but point carries the day", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Ohio Channel, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ohiochannel.org/MediaLibrary/Media.aspx?fileId=137627\">Special Message from Outgoing Ohio Senate President Tom Niehaus</a>,&quot; Dec. 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail correspondence with Niehaus spokeswoman Angela Meleca, Jan. 3, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail and telephone correspondence with the Ohio Senate clerk&rsquo;s office, Jan. 4, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview with Mike Rowe, spokesman for Senate Democrats, Jan. 9, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "President of the Ohio Senate", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Tom", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 1055, "last_name": "Niehaus", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "tom-niehaus", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-tom-niehaus2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1055/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.tomniehaus.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Unlike the gridlock in Washington, more than 80 percent of the bills we passed during this General Assembly had bipartisan support.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an online video", "statement_date": "2013-01-03", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 149, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/149/", "subject": "Bipartisanship", "subject_slug": "bipartisanship", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
