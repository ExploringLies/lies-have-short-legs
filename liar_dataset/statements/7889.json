Rick Perry said, &quot;Current law already requires state agencies to give preference to goods produced and grown in Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry said in a <a href=\"http://governor.state.tx.us/news/press-release/18567/\">press release</a> May 25, 2013, the day of the veto, that &quot;HB 535 requires state agencies, when purchasing goods, to give preference to goods &lsquo;manufactured&rsquo; in Texas. &hellip; This bill simply does not change current law.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSoon after, a reader emailed us to ask: &quot;Is this truly in current law&quot;?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe law that the bill would have modified is in <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.2155.htm#2155.444\">Section 2155.444</a> of the state&#39;s Government Code, which says that when &quot;making purchases of goods, including agricultural products,&quot; the comptroller and state agencies &quot;shall give preference to those produced or grown in this state or offered by Texas bidders.&quot; Next, the law says, goods from elsewhere in the United States must be considered.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tState law has contained Texas-first purchasing preferences for more than 50 years. According to a May 4, 1981, state attorney general <a href=\"https://www.oag.state.tx.us/opinions/opinions/46white/op/1981/htm/mw0332.htm\">opinion</a>, the Legislature created &quot;Texas preferences&quot; with a 1957 law which replaced an older statute favoring &quot;bidders who have an established local business.&quot; The <a href=\"http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/LASDOCS/55R/SB150/SB150_55R.pdf#page=8\">1957 law</a>, according to the opinion, &quot;created a preference for products produced in Texas as well as one for products offered by Texas citizens.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHB 535, as <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/83R/billtext/pdf/HB00535I.pdf#navpanes=0\">filed</a> Jan. 15, 2013, <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Authors.aspx?LegSess=83R&amp;Bill=HB535\">by</a> Rep. Yvonne Davis, D-Dallas, added &quot;manufactured&quot; to &quot;produced or grown&quot; and included a definition: &quot;&lsquo;Manufactured&rsquo; means, with respect to assembled goods, the final assembly, processing, packaging, testing, or other process that adds value, quality, or reliability.&quot; It added a requirement that the state comptroller shall &quot;promote the purchase of&quot; such Texas-grown or otherwise Texas-created goods.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the legislation&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/83R/billtext/pdf/HB00535F.pdf#navpanes=0\">final version</a>, that definition encompassed items &quot;produced as a result of a manufacturing process that alters the form or function of components&quot; in a way that adds value and transforms the parts into something different from what simply assembling the parts would have produced.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBoth versions also added a requirement that the state comptroller and state agencies &quot;promote the purchase of&quot; Texas goods.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEd Sills, spokesman for the Texas AFL-CIO labor federation, which supported the vetoed proposal, told us by phone that the combined effect of requiring such promotion, emphasizing manufactured goods and encouraging agencies to &quot;buy Texan, buy American&quot; could have been powerful. &quot;Current law does have preferences. It doesn&rsquo;t have as robust a preference as it would have if this bill had passed,&quot; Sills said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA spokesman for the state comptroller&rsquo;s office -- which <a href=\"http://www.window.state.tx.us/procurement/pub/manual/1-0.pdf\">counsels</a> state agencies on purchasing -- said by email that the state interprets the current law to cover goods manufactured in Texas. R.J. DeSilva said, &quot;Texas agencies have always considered the term &lsquo;produced&rsquo; to include manufactured goods. Therefore, the preference for manufactured goods was already being provided.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDeSilva sent us a link to <a href=\"http://info.sos.state.tx.us/pls/pub/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&amp;app=9&amp;p_dir=&amp;p_rloc=&amp;p_tloc=&amp;p_ploc=&amp;pg=1&amp;p_tac=&amp;ti=34&amp;pt=1&amp;ch=20&amp;rl=38\">comptroller procurement rules</a> in the Texas Administrative Code stating, &quot;Supplies, materials, and equipment are considered to be produced in Texas if they are manufactured in Texas; &lsquo;manufactured&rsquo; does not include the work of packaging or repackaging.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry said, &quot;Current law already requires state agencies to give preference to goods produced and grown in Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat holds up.
