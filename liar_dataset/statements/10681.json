Janet Adkins, R-Fernandina Beach, sponsored a bill that would give districts $10 per child to <a href=\"http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=54521&amp;SessionId=76\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>adopt standard attire policies</u></a> in kindergarten through eighth grade. The state would set aside $10 million in all from the general revenue fund. Similar provisions have been amended to a <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/gradebook/should-florida-schools-require-uniforms/2223524\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>school bill in the Senate</u></a>, although without the cash incentive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adkins said that school uniforms help create a positive learning environment, because it removes distractions. She cited testimony from officials from five Florida school districts that raved about their uniform policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They were all saying the same thing, and that is when they implemented a school uniform policy in their schools, the climate, the culture at their schools improved,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.news4jax.com/news/florida-legislation-encourages-school-uniforms/32032930\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Adkins said</u></a>. &quot;It&#39;s an issue of school safety, helps with school truancy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The House passed the bill 102-8 on March 27, but we were curious whether requiring students to dress the same really did improve school safety and truancy records. Turns out the research is anything but uniform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dressing up stats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adkins&rsquo; bill would not make uniforms mandatory in any district, although there are already five counties that do have at least a district-wide K-8 standard student attire policy, according to <a href=\"http://myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=h7043c.EDC.DOCX&amp;DocumentType=Analysis&amp;BillNumber=7043&amp;Session=2015\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a House analysis</u></a>. Those five are Alachua, Bay, Madison, Osceola and Polk counties. Otherwise the decision to require uniforms filters down to varying degrees at the local level, even school by school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether or not the practice makes students safer or fosters better attendance really comes down to what study you read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 1996 study of Long Beach, Calif., schools found a <a href=\"http://eus.sagepub.com/content/28/4/424.refs\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>marked decrease</u></a> in fights, sexual violence and weapons possession two years after adopting school uniforms. A different take on the issue from 2007 using national data found average assaults had actually gone up by an <a href=\"http://swacj.org/swjcj/archives/4.1/School_Violence.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>average of 14 incidents</u></a> in violent schools that required standard attire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One researcher we spoke with said that a big part of uniform policies is the perception they make schools safer. Jafeth Sanchez, a research assistant professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, said <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15388220.2012.706873#abstract\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>surveys she gave students</u></a> at three middle schools showed the kids felt like uniforms curbed violence, although that feeling dropped in the second year students were asked. (Adkins&rsquo; office directed us to this study as proof of her statement, but said she used a couple of others, as well.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those results could be because the students got used to wearing uniforms. Or, it could be because the initial answers weren&rsquo;t honest, but Sanchez thought that was unlikely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Generally, students do respond honestly to such things &ndash; particularly considering that the majority indicated they didn&rsquo;t like wearing uniforms, even though they actually agreed or strongly agreed with their various benefits,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other experts we interviewed said there was a kind of &quot;halo effect&quot; in which students and teachers <em>felt </em>things had improved, even if they hadn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research into attendance is another matter, and often the two subjects aren&rsquo;t studied at the same time. A Youngstown State University study from 2006 looked at Ohio secondary schools and found <a href=\"http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED497409.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>attendance and graduation rates clearly went up</u></a>. University of Houston researchers checked into attendance in 2010 and found <a href=\"https://www.utdallas.edu/research/tsp-erc/pdf/seminar_paper_imberman.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the difference was slight</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Specifically attendance rates in middle and high schools increased by approximately &frac12; to 1 day per year. There was no impact on elementary attendance,&quot; according to Scott Imberman, who worked on the University of Houston research and now teaches economics at Michigan State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added it is<strong> </strong>difficult to measure discipline stats along with uniform implementation because discipline standards may have changed along with the dress code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And some argue school uniforms are an all-around boondoggle. David Brunsma, a sociology professor at Virginia Tech, has studied the issue and wrote a 2004 book called <em>The School Uniform Movement and What It Tells Us about American Education: A Symbolic Crusade</em>. His research from national samples found no significant effects on behavior, absenteeism or student attitudes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is classic,&quot; he told PolitiFact Florida via email. &quot;However, it is based on misinformation, common (non)sense, and, of course, pressure from the children&rsquo;s clothier industry.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adkins said school uniforms improve school safety and truancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some studies that say there are changes for the better and worse for both school violence and attendance statistics once uniforms are adopted, but there&rsquo;s hardly a consensus. Even if there is improvement, research suggests the positives are slight -- not exactly the evidence Adkins says overwhelmingly supports the benefits of these policies. Some experts think the actual impact on students is negligible or even negative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-04-01T17:39:10.431210", "ruling_date": "2015-04-02T10:44:15", "ruling_headline": "School uniforms improve school safety and truancy, Rep.
