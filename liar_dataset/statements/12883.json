Debbie Wasserman Schultz pointed blame at Republicans -- namely Gov. Rick Scott -- for not doing more to dish out dollars to prevent the spread of the Zika virus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While he seems to be saying out loud that he wants Congress and the president to provide more funding, he conveniently leaves out that he cut nearly $1 million dollars from mosquito control and closed down the state&rsquo;s mosquito research lab a few years ago,&quot; Wasserman Schultz said at a <a href=\"http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2016/08/debbie-wasserman-schultz-bashes-rick-scott-paul-ryan-at-zika-town-hall.html\">town hall</a> in Broward County on Aug. 8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wasserman Schultz is running for re-election in the Aug. 30 Democratic primary against first-time candidate Tim Canova.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Scott cut funding and close the state&rsquo;s mosquito research lab? There&rsquo;s a lot more nuance to this story than Wasserman Schultz lets on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mosquito control budget</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current Zika pandemic took off in May 2015, when Brazil reported cases in connection with more babies being born with abnormally small heads, a condition called microcephaly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Wasserman Schultz spoke, there had been a total of 422 Zika cases in South Florida, the majority acquired while traveling and 16 locally acquired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wasserman Schultz told reporters that she was referring to Scott&rsquo;s budget decisions in 2011. Her spokesman pointed to an article in <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2016/08/scott-boasts-about-states-zika-fight-but-slashed-mosquito-control-funding-to-save-money-104539#ixzz4GTupUPme\">Politico </a>that explained cuts to state aid to local mosquito control programs. That was Scott&rsquo;s first budget year after he ran on a platform to slash spending amid the recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State budget records show that while Florida under Scott cut money to mosquito control his first two years, the state later raised it substantially:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://floridafiscalportal.state.fl.us/Document.aspx?ID=2928&amp;DocType=PDF\">2010-11: </a>$2.2 million (Gov. Charlie Crist&#39;s last budget)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://floridafiscalportal.state.fl.us/Document.aspx?ID=14436&amp;DocType=PDF\">2011-12:</a> $1.3 million (Scott&rsquo;s first budget)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://floridafiscalportal.state.fl.us/Document.aspx?ID=6236&amp;DocType=PDF\">2012-13:</a> $1 million</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://floridafiscalportal.state.fl.us/Document.aspx?ID=8401&amp;DocType=PDF\">2013-14:</a> $2.7 million</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://floridafiscalportal.state.fl.us/Document.aspx?ID=11929&amp;DocType=PDF\">2014-15:</a> $2.8 million</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://floridafiscalportal.state.fl.us/Document.aspx?ID=11931&amp;DocType=PDF\">2015-16:</a> $2.7 million</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://floridafiscalportal.state.fl.us/Document.aspx?ID=14435&amp;DocType=PDF\">2016-17:</a> $2.8 million</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jackie Schutz, a spokeswoman for Scott, said that he has invested more than $13.2 million in funding for mosquito prevention and control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, &quot;Gov. Scott has allocated more than $26 million to combat Zika and will continue to allocate more if necessary,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mosquito lab</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wasserman Schultz&rsquo;s claim about the closed lab relates to the Florida A&amp;M University Public Health Entomology Research and Education Center in Panama City Beach. In 2011, Scott <a href=\"http://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/05.26.2011-Veto-List.pdf\">vetoed </a>a one-time $500,000 appropriation for the center intended to keep it open after it had faced threats of closure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The center, first opened in 1964, was referred to as the &quot;mosquito lab&quot; or PHEREC, and came up with ways to combat mosquitoes. It was once a part of a state department, but in the 1990s it became part of Florida A&amp;M while still receiving state health department dollars and other grants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2010 as Florida A&amp;M was cutting millions of dollars from the university amid state cuts, it announced that PHEREC was on the chopping block.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provost Cynthia Hughes Harris said at the time that the university decided to eliminate non-teaching units such as the mosquito lab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a last-ditch attempt to save the lab, researchers sought a one-time appropriation from the 2011 Legislature for $500,000 late in the budget process. Florida TaxWatch labeled it a <a href=\"http://www.floridataxwatch.org/resources/pdf/201112FloridaTaxWatchTurkeyList.pdf\">&quot;turkey,&quot;</a> and Scott vetoed it as part of his $615 million in vetoes as the state was climbing out of the recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lab still had $1.4 million -- enough to keep it open -- but the university chose to shutter it anyway, wrote Dr. John Smith, the center&rsquo;s former director, in a Florida Mosquito Control Association <a href=\"http://mosquito.ifas.ufl.edu/Documents/Buzzwords/Vol11No4.pdf\">newsletter</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In fact, there were sufficient reserve funds to continue PHEREC for as much as two or three years without the legislative appropriation,&quot; Smith wrote. &quot;Why FAMU did not allow this remains unclear.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walter J. Tabachnick, at the time director of the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory at the University of Florida&rsquo;s site near Vero Beach, warned about the loss of dollars in a <a href=\"http://fmel.ifas.ufl.edu/buzz/wtresearchfunds.shtml\">blog</a> after the cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How can one quantify the loss of future opportunities to make progress and improvements in Florida mosquito control?&quot; he wrote. &quot;There will be future problems for which we will not have solutions, there will be lost opportunities to make mosquito control more effective, efficient, and environmentally proper.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Tabachnick who remains a professor at UF, told PolitiFact Florida that the decision to close the lab wasn&rsquo;t by Scott.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The decision to close PHEREC, to withdraw all funding, was made by Florida A&amp;M, not the governor,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the state has funded research at a different university center. The <a href=\"http://fmel.ifas.ufl.edu/\">Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory</a> at UF has received $500,000 annually from the state since 2013-14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That money is for research to develop and test formulations, application techniques, and procedures of pesticides and biological control agents to control mosquitoes that can cause public health or a nuisance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking to reporters after her town hall, Wasserman Schultz pointed the finger at Scott for the spread of Zika.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He bears some responsibility in this problem that we are facing now since we are not as fully prepared as we could be if those cuts had not come down,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tabachnick says it&rsquo;s not so simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are no promises in investment in research,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&rsquo;t know what information we may have had or not. It&rsquo;s like saying if we had more money in cancer, we would find a cure. I can&rsquo;t say that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wasserman Schultz said that Scott &quot;cut nearly $1 million dollars from mosquito control and closed down the state&rsquo;s mosquito research lab a few years ago.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, the Legislature under Scott did cut about $1 million for mosquito control dropping the total to about $1.3 million and cut it again by about $300,000 the following year. But the state then increased the budget to about $2.7 million the next year and it has remained in that ballpark for four years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott also vetoed a one-time appropriation of $500,000 in 2011 for a mosquito lab at FAMU, and the university then shut it down. But the center was already on the university&rsquo;s chopping block, and the state has since funded another university&rsquo;s lab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dc020bc4-ac97-44c4-942a-89399198ed1e\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dc020bc4-ac97-44c4-942a-89399198ed1e</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-09T17:00:28.211571", "ruling_date": "2016-08-09T17:25:14", "ruling_headline": "Debbie Wasserman Schultz misleads in attack on Rick Scott about mosquito funding", "ruling_headline_slug": "debbie-wasserman-schultz-misleads-attack-rick-scot", "ruling_link_text": "A biting claim that omits full picture", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://floridafiscalportal.state.fl.us/Publications.aspx?DT=16\">Florida Fiscal Portal</a>, 2010-2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gov.
