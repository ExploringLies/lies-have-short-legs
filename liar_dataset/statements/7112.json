We decided that taking one on Thanksgiving would give all of us something to be thankful for.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut fact-checking doesn&#39;t take a holiday.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we received a Thanksgiving news release from Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, our attention was immediately seized. In addition to holiday greetings, the release included three recipes DeWine credited to his wife, Fran.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said the recipes -- for crescent rolls, broccoli salad and &quot;Fran&#39;s carrot cake with lemon cream cheese icing&quot; -- are family favorites and part of a delicious and traditional Thanksgiving meal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHoping it didn&#39;t look too obviously like we were pitching for samples, PolitiFact Ohio asked the attorney general how he backs up his claim of deliciousness.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I think I would start with the rolls,&quot; he told us. &quot;Fran&#39;s been making these rolls for, well, we&#39;ve been married for 45 years, and she&#39;s been making the rolls for probably 40. She took it from a recipe in one of her first cookbooks, and she modified it mainly by adding honey.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe also adds cracked wheat flour from the family farm because &quot;it embodies the spirit of the harvest,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The strongest evidence (of deliciousness) I would give,&quot; he continued, &quot;is if you would be there on Thanksgiving, or any other meal, to watch our grandkids wait for the turkey to come out of the oven.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Fran takes the turkey out and puts the rolls in. Before they can actually get served, kids are taking rolls off the pan, burning their fingers to get them. I&#39;ve seen them put as many as five on a plate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe DeWines have 18 grandchildren, with a 19th on the way next month. They host 75 people for Thanksgiving.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo feed them all, Mrs. DeWine makes 12 dozen rolls.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;They&#39;re to die for,&quot; her husband said. &quot;The best evidence is to watch people eat them. Even people who say they don&#39;t eat rolls like them. At any family gathering, really, people expect Fran to have them.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeWine sometimes spreads them with red raspberry jam from his son, an organic farmer. To be really decadent, he said, he adds both jam and butter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe questioned whether that wouldn&#39;t be so good it&#39;s illegal. Exercising his prosecutorial discretion as the state&#39;s chief law enforcement officer, he assured us we would be on safe legal ground.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said the broccoli salad was a relatively new addition to the holiday menu that was added by a daughter-in-law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&#39;m not a great fan of broccoli per se, but in that combination it&#39;s very, very tasty,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s a healthy, interesting mixture.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked him about the cake. At PolitiFact Ohio, we are well known as carrot cake fiends.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The carrot cake is also a favorite of mine,&quot; he said. &quot;The frosting is very similar to a frosting my mother used to make on chocolate cake, a cream cheese with lemon frosting. When it comes out of the oven &hellip;&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio didn&rsquo;t press him to finish the description. We had heard enough to begin pondering how we could slip in for dinner.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA family recipe in use four decades certainly is a tradition. And DeWine&rsquo;s descriptions left us craving his wife&rsquo;s cooking. We rate his claim of deliciousness as True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;re sharing the recipe for Fran DeWine&rsquo;s Favorite Rolls above. They would certainly enhance any holiday leftovers.
