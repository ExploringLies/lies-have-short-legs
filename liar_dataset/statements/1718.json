Chet Edwards, D-Waco, seeking re-election, lashed out at his GOP foe  shortly after Bill Flores captured his party&rsquo;s nomination in an April 13  primary runoff.</p>\r\n<p>In an \"Opening Statement\" campaign video posted  online April 14, Edwards says the race will focus on his championing of  veterans and his work for jobs and economic development. Edwards goes  on to say Flores &ldquo;has been recruited by Washington, D.C., insiders to  try to buy our district's congressional seat with millions of dollars he  has made as a Houston oil executive even though he has never once voted  in a general election in our district &mdash; not even once.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The  charge that a wealthy candidate is trying to \"buy\" elective office is  common in politics; for this article, we're looking at whether Edwards  accurately depicts Flores&rsquo; voting history as a resident of the  conservative-leaning 17th Congressional District. It covers more than  7,700 square miles in 12 counties, stretching from the suburbs of Fort  Worth, south through Waco and east to Bryan/College Station.</p>\r\n<p>To  back Edwards&rsquo; claim that Flores has never voted in a general election in  the district, Edwards&rsquo; campaign pointed us to a Washington blog post  and an article in the Dallas Morning News. Those reports and  others published by the Waco Tribune-Herald and online Texas Tribune  don't spell out all of Flores&rsquo; voting history. But they touch on Flores  voting in the 2008 Democratic primary. At that time, Rob Curnock was  running unopposed in the GOP primary to challenge Edwards. In this  year's primary runoff in April, Flores defeated Curnock to win his  party's nod for the House seat.</p>\r\n<p>The Tribune's March 29 article  quotes Matt Mackowiak, Flores&rsquo; campaign manager, saying Flores voted in  that Democratic primary in order to oppose then-Sen. Barack Obama for  president, fearing Obama &ldquo;would take our country far to the left.&rdquo;  Mackowiak is also quoted saying he doesn&rsquo;t know which Democratic  presidential candidate Flores voted for. Later that year, Mackowiak  said, Flores phone-banked for GOP nominee John McCain on the day of the  November election, got stuck in business meetings and was unable to  leave in time to vote in the general election.</p>\r\n<p>To independently  gauge Flores&rsquo; voting history, we contacted Brazos County. Flores, who  lives in Bryan, has said his wife moved to the county in 2006, according  to a voter guide posted online by the Dallas Morning News. Mackowiak said Flores lived in College Station while the couple's house was being built in nearby Bryan.</p>\r\n<p>Kathy  Schuetze, the county&rsquo;s voter registration coordinator, told us records  show Flores voting five times there: the 2010 GOP primary and runoffs,  fall 2009 elections related to the Bryan Independent School District and  proposed state constitutional amendments, plus the 2008 Democratic  primary <br /><br />Trying another source, we contacted Democratic  pollster Jeff Smith of Austin, who maintains a statewide voter database.  Smith said his database indicates that Flores registered to vote in  Brazos County in December 2006. He said that while Flores missed the  2008 general election, Flores' wife, Gina Bass Flores, did vote then.</p>\r\n<p>So, there's no indication Flores has voted in a general election in the district. Then again, we wondered if the  2009 balloting on proposed constitutional amendments also was a general  election because it occurred on a date that state law defines as the  possible date of a special or general election -- the first Tuesday  after the first Monday of November.</p>\r\n<p>Randall Dillard, spokesman  for the Texas Secretary of State, which oversees elections, said many voters  might have thought they were voting in a general election. However,  Dillard noted, the Texas Election Code defines a general election as an  election, other than a primary, that regularly recurs at fixed dates. In contrast, state legislators pick the dates of elections on proposed  constitutional amendments.</p>\r\n<p>Flores' voting record drew  questions earlier this year. Flores said at a February debate that he  voted for Curnock in the 2008 general election -- then later said he'd  been joking, according to an online post by the Lone Star Project, a  pro-Democratic group.</p>\r\n<p>We sought to interview Flores. Mackowiak  declined our request. He also confirmed that Flores has yet to vote in a  general election in the district.</p>\r\n<p>We rate Edwards&rsquo; statement as  True.<br /><br /><br /></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-04-21T23:16:43.647774", "ruling_date": "2010-04-26T23:22:21", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Rep.
