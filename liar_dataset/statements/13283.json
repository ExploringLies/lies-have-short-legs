She said she would change them as president, a move that has become known as the &quot;Buffett rule.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Warren Buffett is the one who&#39;s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary,&quot; Clinton said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/warren-buffett/\">Warren Buffett</a> is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Forbes estimates him to be worth $64.3 billion and one of the<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/\"> richest men in the world.</a> He is also a Hillary Clinton supporter and has sparred with Donald Trump over Trump&rsquo;s refusal to release his tax returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Urging major tax changes, Buffett has repeatedly said he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary and other employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu5B-2LoC4s\">In 2007</a>, Buffett told NBC Nightly News that he pays a smaller tax rate than multiple employees in his office.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>In 2011, Buffett wrote an op-ed in the New York Times called <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/stop-coddling-the-super-rich.html?_r=0\">&quot;Stop Coddling the Super-Rich.&quot;</a> In the article, Buffett said that his taxes amounted to &quot;only 17.4 percent of my taxable income &mdash; and that&rsquo;s actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/04/news/economy/buffett-secretary-taxes/\">In 2013,</a> he told CNBC that while his tax rate rose 8 to 9 points more that year, &quot;The differential between me and the rest of the office, not just my secretary but the rest of the office, was greater than that. It&#39;ll be closer, but I&#39;ll probably be the lowest-paying taxpayer in the office.&quot;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A quick phone call to Buffett&rsquo;s office confirmed this fact-check. Buffett&rsquo;s assistant Debbie Bosanek -- the secretary Buffett mentions -- confirmed her boss pays a lower tax rate than she does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how can this be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buffett&rsquo;s op-ed says his tax rate is lower than his employees&rsquo; because money made off investments is taxed at a lower rate than wage income</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine &mdash; most likely by a lot,&quot; Buffett said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal income is taxed based on how much a person makes each year. In 2016, the brackets range from 10 percent for those making $9,275 or less, to a top marginal rate of 39.6 percent for those making $415,051 or more. Meanwhile, the tax rate on long-term capital gains -- the profits from investments -- is <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409.html\">15 percent.</a> However, if the taxpayer&#39;s taxable income is greater than $415,051, their long term capital gains are taxed at 20 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the current rates for a single taxpayer.</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Taxable Income</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Tax Rate</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$0 to $9,275</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>10%</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$9,276 to $37,650</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$927.50 plus 15% of the amount over $9,275</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$37,651 to $91,150</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$5,183.75 plus 25% of the amount over $37,650</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$91,151 to $190,150</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$18,558.75 plus 28% of the amount over $91,150</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$190,151 to $413,350</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$46,278.75 plus 33% of the amount over $190,150</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$413,351 to $415,050</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$119,934.75 plus 35% of the amount over $413,350</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$415,051 or more</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$120,529.75 plus 39.6% of the amount over $415,050</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>On Oct. 10, 2016, Buffett released details about his personal tax data in a statement titled, <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161010005859/en/Tax-Facts-Donald-Trump\">&quot;Some Tax Facts for Donald Trump.&quot;</a> He says he paid $1.85 million in federal taxes in 2015, and his adjusted gross income was $11.6 million. That means he paid 15.9 percent in effective federal income tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lawrence Zelenak, a Duke University law professor, said in an email most taxpayers with incomes in the low six figures have a higher rate than 16 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s true even if you consider only federal income tax. Add in payroll tax and Buffet&#39;s rate becomes even lower compared with his secretary,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes, and are deducted by your employer before you get your paycheck. These taxes pay for <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/understanding-employment-taxes\">Medicare and Social Security.</a> The employee tax rate for Social Security is typically 6.2 percent of your gross income, up to $113,700, and 1.45 percent on all income for Medicare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These two rates are not progressive or applied to all income, so as income increases, they make up a smaller percentage of the total income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Buffett makes the majority of his money from investments, his wage income -- and therefore his payroll taxes -- are low. But those who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. We don&rsquo;t know what salary Buffett&rsquo;s secretary earns, but it&rsquo;s likely much higher than the median pay for secretaries. (Remember that Buffett is one of the richest men in the world.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A study from the nonpartisan <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/baseline-distribution-tables-under-current-law/baseline-tables-distribution-income\">The Tax Policy Center </a>says that people making between $100,000 and $200,000 pay an average 19.6 percent in taxes, including payroll and income taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said Buffett claimed to pay a smaller tax rate than his secretary. Buffett&rsquo;s secretary confirmed she pays a higher rate than her boss. Buffett said he pays about 16 percent in income taxes, while any employee making between $100,000 and $200,000 typically pays about 20 percent in taxes.
