To put this in perspective, that&rsquo;s equivalent of the population of Tulsa, Okla.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether there really were 400,000 &quot;anchor babies&quot; born in the United States every year (and yes, that <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml\">is</a> the population size of Tulsa). Are the undocumented mothers specifically coming here to give birth in hopes of some kind of legal status?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t hear back from Lewandowski or the Trump campaign. We did, however, find the number in congressional testimony from the Center for Immigration Studies, a research organization that supports lower immigration levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Every year, 350,000 to 400,000 children are born to illegal immigrants in the United States,&quot; the center&rsquo;s Jon Feere <a href=\"http://judiciary.house.gov/_cache/files/9504b34f-9f28-4e49-b31d-7d5a4e86d6c9/feere-testimony.pdf\">said on April 29, 2015</a>. &quot;To put it another way, as many as one out of 10 births in the United States is now to an illegal immigrant mother.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those figures may have been accurate several years ago, but they are outdated when compared to current estimates, said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center. Passel is the author of a widely cited <a href=\"http://pewhispanic.org/2010/08/11/unauthorized-immigrants-and-their-us-born-children/\">2010 Pew Hispanic Center report</a> that pins the number of children born to undocumented immigrants at 340,000 in 2008 (about 8 percent of all births that year).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Figures as high as 400,000 per year are plausible for the mid 2000s, but our current estimates are around 300,000 per year,&quot; he told us. &quot;The numbers were higher in the mid 2000s than now &mdash; in part because there were more unauthorized immigrants then and overall birth rates, for natives and immigrants alike, were higher before the recession.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Lewandowski&rsquo;s number is slightly exaggerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His characterization of these births as &quot;anchor babies&quot; is also problematic, however, as the metaphor implies intent that the numbers don&rsquo;t back up. Based on <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/06/lindsey-graham/illegal-immigrants-anchor-babies-birthright/\">past reporting</a>, it&rsquo;s not clear whether every birth to an undocumented mother was for the purpose of tethering the family to American soil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are a million hardworking Hispanic people in San Diego who came here to work and then happened to have a baby,&quot; midwife Lauren Weber said in the&nbsp;2010 fact-check. &quot;Then, there are people who come over in order to have a baby.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weber also described a practice known as &quot;birth tourism,&quot; in which middle- and upper-class visitors on tourist visas travel to the United States specifically to have a baby. The numbers for these types of births are much lower, at around 8,600, or 0.2 percent of all births, in 2013, according to the <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/natality/2013/natl2013.pdf\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for undocummented immigrants, experts don&#39;t think they have the same motivations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I believe that most migrants come for economic reasons and opportunity,&quot; said Theresa Brown, the director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Institute. &quot;The idea that their child may be able to sponsor them for a green card in 21 years is probably too long term to be a primary driver of immigration.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roberto Suro, a communications and journalism professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in Hispanic issues, had also&nbsp;pointed that&nbsp;if undocumented immigration was spurred by &quot;anchor babies,&quot; more undocumented immigrants would be women of childbearing age. The data shows the exact opposite: Adult immigrant men vastly <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2009/04/14/iii-demographic-and-family-characteristics/\">outnumber</a> women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lewandowski said that 400,000 &quot;anchor babies&quot; are born in the U.S. every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim is not as straight-forward as it seems. First, the figure is outdated &mdash; a more accurate number for the amount of births to undocumented immigrants is 300,000. Lewandowski also makes a blanket statement when he says all of these births occurred specifically to anchor the undocumented families to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the practice occurs, it&rsquo;s not safe to draw a single broad conclusion from the data and apply it to the intentions of every pregnant undocumented woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-08-23T11:59:59.871849", "ruling_date": "2015-08-23T18:16:44", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump's campaign manager: 400,000 'anchor babies' born in U.S. every year", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trumps-campaign-manager-says-there-are-4000", "ruling_link_text": "Outdated number and a broad conclusion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CNN, <em><a href=\"http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2015/08/23/trumps-2016-presidential-camgaign-manager-on-whether-jeb-bushs-campaign-is-taking-donald-trump-seriously-i-think-what-they-say-and-what-they-do-are-two-different-things/\">State of the Union</a>,</em> Aug. 23, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. House Judiciary Committee, <a href=\"http://judiciary.house.gov/_cache/files/9504b34f-9f28-4e49-b31d-7d5a4e86d6c9/feere-testimony.pdf\">Statement of Jon Feere</a>, April 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew Hispanic Center, <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2010/08/11/unauthorized-immigrants-and-their-us-born-children/\">Unauthorized Immigrants and Their U.S.-Born Children</a>, Aug. 11, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/06/lindsey-graham/illegal-immigrants-anchor-babies-birthright/\">Fact-checking the claims about &#39;anchor babies&#39; and whether illegal immigrants &#39;drop and leave&#39;</a>, Aug. 6, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/natality/2013/natl2013.pdf\">User Guide to the 2013 Natality Public File</a>, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Chicago Tribune,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chapman/ct-birthright-citizenship-donald-trump-perspec-0823-20150821-column.html\">Why citizenship should remain a birthright</a>, Aug. 21, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Research Center, Aug. 23, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Steve Chapman, <em>Chicago Tribune</em> columnist, Aug. 23, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with&nbsp;Theresa Brown, director of immigration poicy at th Bipartisan Policy Institute, Aug. 23,&nbsp;2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Campaign manager for Donald Trump", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Corey", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3273, "last_name": "Lewandowski", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "corey-lewandowski", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/coreylewmug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3273/", "total_count": 7, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says&nbsp;&quot;there&rsquo;s 400,000&quot; anchor babies born in the United States a year, which are&nbsp;&quot;individuals coming to our country and having their children so their children can be U.S. citizens.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\"", "statement_date": "2015-08-23", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>Amnesty,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">self-deportation</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/donald-trump-mexico-immigration-presidential-campaign\">wall</a>.
