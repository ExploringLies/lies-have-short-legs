The paper reported that a $916 million loss could have enabled Trump to cancel out earned income in other years, enough to legally pay no personal federal income tax for up to 18 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump campaign&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/trump-campaign-statement1\">unsigned statement</a> argued in part that Trump had an obligation to pay the lowest amount of taxes possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mr. Trump is a highly&nbsp;skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,&rsquo; the statement said in part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But does Trump have a &quot;fiduciary responsibility&quot; to pay as little as possible in personal income taxes? Most experts agreed that no such responsibility exists. (Trump&rsquo;s campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with defining what &quot;fiduciary responsibility&quot; means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most basic <a href=\"http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/fiduciary-duty.html\">definition</a> of fiduciary responsibility is a legal obligation of one party to act in the best interests of another. (There are <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fiduciary_duty\">other types of fiduciary relationships</a> than economic ones -- such as attorneys to their clients, priests to their parishioners and doctors to their patients -- but we&rsquo;ll set those aside here.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a business setting, fiduciary obligation most often refers to the principle that a company&rsquo;s management has a responsibility to act in the best interests of those who own the company -- its stockholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s some disagreement about how this principle should be put into practice -- for instance, should a company maximize its short-term income regardless of the risks that doing so could carry for the long-term success of the company?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, though, the overarching principle is considered fairly straightforward: A company&rsquo;s manager is under an obligation to put shareholders&rsquo; interests ahead of his or her own personal financial interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This principle is commonly followed in the business world. But most experts we contacted said that while the fiduciary principle would govern how a company pays its taxes, it would not apply to Trump&rsquo;s personal tax return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The general view is that corporate law imposes a fiduciary responsibility on company managers to maximize company profits on behalf of the company&rsquo;s owners,&quot; said Dennis Caplan, associate professor of accounting at the University at Albany. That means that if Trump managed a company owned by others, he&rsquo;d have an obligation to minimize corporate taxes in order to maximize profits, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s not the case for personal income tax returns -- and it is those returns that were leaked to the <em>New York Times</em> and that were the subject of the speculation about 18 tax-free years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I do not see how the taxes on his personal tax return would be relevant with respect to this particular fiduciary responsibility,&quot; Caplan said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other experts agreed. Richard W. Painter, a University of Minnesota corporate law professor who was previously chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, told PolitiFact that &quot;one does not have fiduciary duty to other people, except perhaps a joint-filing spouse, when filing personal tax returns.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Painter added that there is also &quot;no such thing&quot; as a fiduciary duty to oneself. &quot;That&rsquo;s called greed,&quot; he put it in an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/business/donald-trump-taxes-fiduciary-duty.html?_r=0\">interview</a> with the <em>New York Times</em>. &quot;And greed is not a component of the law of fiduciary duty anywhere.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fiduciary responsibility argument is something that Trump is &quot;making up,&quot; said Daniel Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University Law School. &quot;No such responsibility would extend to his personal taxes, even if he were the CEO of a publicly traded company,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between tax evasion, which is illegal, and tax avoidance, which is legal, said Charles Elson, director of the University of Delaware&#39;s John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. He suspects that Trump was trying to echo this old piece of wisdom, but not successfully. The statement was not done in the &quot;most artfully crafted&quot; way, Elson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At most, Trump might be able to argue that he has some fiduciary obligations to his employees, suggested Lawrence White, a professor at New York University&rsquo;s Stern School of Business. That would be arguable &quot;to the extent that any bankruptcy -- which might have arisen if he had not availed himself of these loss carry-forward/carry-back opportunities -- would have converted them into unsecured claimants for any delayed wages or other benefits,&quot; White said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, that&rsquo;s a &quot;novel&quot; argument untested in the courts, said University of Chicago Law School professor Daniel Hemel, writing in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/whatever-source-derived/trumps-fictitious-fiduciary-duties-8af769a5c1c0#.wwfegbmeg\">Medium</a> post. &quot;Employers generally have no fiduciary duties to their employees,&quot; Hemel wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement from Trump&rsquo;s campaign said he has &quot;a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That might have been a credible argument if he were referring to his companies&rsquo; tax returns. But the statement was in response to controversy surrounding Trump&rsquo;s personal tax returns. Experts we contacted said there is no generally accepted fiduciary obligation keep one&rsquo;s own taxes low. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is not accurate. We rate it False.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3108538b-63c9-4643-a6b3-4833eaa0441c\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3108538b-63c9-4643-a6b3-4833eaa0441c</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-07T13:58:32.735995", "ruling_date": "2016-10-09T20:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump has no 'fiduciary responsibility' on his personal tax returns, experts say", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-has-no-fiduciary-responsibility-his-p", "ruling_link_text": "No such duty exists, experts say", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump campaign, <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/trump-campaign-statement1\">statement</a>, Oct. 1, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legal Information Institute, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fiduciary_duty\">definition of &quot;fiduciary duty,</a>&quot; accessed Oct. 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/business/donald-trump-taxes-fiduciary-duty.html?_r=0\">The Trump Campaign&rsquo;s Questionable Tax Return Justifica</a>tion,&quot; Oct. 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-money/2016/10/fiduciary-duty-nonsense-216629\">Fiduciary Duty Nonsense</a>,&quot; Oct. 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel Hemel, &quot;<a href=\"https://medium.com/whatever-source-derived/trumps-fictitious-fiduciary-duties-8af769a5c1c0#.pj7798136\">Trump&rsquo;s Fictitious Fiduciary Duties</a>&quot; (Medium post), Oct. 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with&nbsp;Charles Elson, director of the University of Delaware&#39;s John L.
