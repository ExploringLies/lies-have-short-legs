Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., is clearly no fan of President Barack Obama. In recent weeks, like most weeks, she skewered his administration&rsquo;s handling of the Benghazi attack, the IRS scrutiny of tea party groups and the health care law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Facebook meme suggests she also took to the airwaves to sort of blame Obama for the <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/incoming/4-killed-in-shootings-at-fort-hood/2173318\"><u>shootings by an Iraq War veteran at Fort Hood, Texas</u></a>, that resulted in four deaths and 16 injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m not saying Obama is responsible for the Fort Wood<strong> </strong>(sic) shooting. I&rsquo;m just saying that we have zero proof that he isn&rsquo;t,&quot; Bachmann is quoted as saying on Sean Hannity&rsquo;s Fox News show April 2, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reader asked us if this post, which he said he saw on Facebook, is real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first clue that something is fishy: The post refers to Fort Wood, not Fort Hood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second: The screenshot that serves as the backdrop for the quote is from <a href=\"http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2013/06/michele_bachmann_on_fox_news_i_may_run_for_another_public_office_video.php\"><u>Bachmann&rsquo;s June 2013 interview</u></a> on Fox News&rsquo; <em>Hannity </em>when she discussed her decision to leave Congress at the end of her term in January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bachmann was not on Hannity&rsquo;s show on April 2, 2014, the date attributed to the quote. She did appear on <em><a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/oreilly/2014/04/04/former-cia-director-grilled-over-benghazi\"><u>The O&rsquo;Reilly Factor</u></a></em> on April 3, but it was to talk about her questioning of a former CIA official over the Benghazi attacks. She didn&rsquo;t say the quote in question there either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Lexis Nexis review of recent transcripts shows she has not commented about the attacks on the army base beyond this tweet saying she was praying for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MicheleBachmann/status/451510826365894656\"><u>Fort Hood community</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Congresswoman Bachmann never said that quote, and didn&rsquo;t even appear on Hannity that day. It&rsquo;s 100 percent fake,&quot; said her spokesman Dan Kotman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He pointed out that the same Facebook group where this <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10202631456526704&amp;set=o.724454217579735&amp;type=1\"><u>meme was shared</u></a>, the satirical Christians for Michele Bachmann, was also behind a widely shared and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/feb/12/facebook-posts/bachmann-didnt-say-bible-was-written-english-and-n/\"><u>debunked post</u></a> alleging Bachmann said Jesus wrote the Bible in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bachmann may not blame Obama for the shooting, but conservative blog Gateway Pundit did, writing, &quot;The Obama administration is responsible for this mass shooting. They witnessed this before. They didn&rsquo;t learn a thing. Gun free zones are death zones.&quot; The post was referenced by hosts of <a href=\"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2014/04/fox-friends-quotes-gateway-pundit-gunfree-zones-are-death-zones-its-time-to-stand-up-to-the-lunacy-video/\"><em><u>Fox &amp; Friends</u></em><u> on April 3.</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t Bachmann. We can&rsquo;t find a trace of her saying, &quot;I&rsquo;m not saying Obama is responsible for the Fort Wood shooting. I&rsquo;m just saying that we have zero proof that he isn&rsquo;t.&quot; And she wasn&rsquo;t on <em>Hannity </em>on the night the posts says she was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post appears to be satire, but not everyone has taken it that way -- all you have to do is read the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10202631456526704&amp;set=o.724454217579735&amp;type=1\">comments on the original photo.</a> That&#39;s why we&#39;re stepping in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-04-10T14:35:05.805496", "ruling_date": "2014-04-10T15:20:00", "ruling_headline": "Facebook post says Michele Bachmann said 'we have zero proof' Obama is not behind Fort Hood shootings", "ruling_headline_slug": "facebook-post-says-michele-bachmann-said-we-have-z", "ruling_link_text": "She said what?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10202631456526704&amp;set=o.724454217579735&amp;type=1\"><u>Meme</u></a> posted to Facebook by Christians for Michele Bachmann</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://static.politifact.com.s3.amazonaws.com/politifact%2Fphotos%2FFacebookC4MicheleBachmann.png\"><u>Meme</u></a> posted to Facebook by Christians for Michele Bachmann, Feb. 3, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Dan Kotman, spokesman, U.S. Rep.
