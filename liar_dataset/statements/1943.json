He dedicated a blog post to his position on his campaign Web page. <br /><br />\"Predictably, liberal activists call the Gulf disaster a warning of things to come if we expand drilling, but this incident is an unfortunate exception to the rule. The last major oil spill from a drilling accident in America happened over 40 years ago in 1969. In fact, oil spills from tankers are far more common than the very rare leaks from rigs or pipelines.\"<br /><br />An earlier PolitiFact item ruled that Johnson's claim that the last major oil spill from a drilling accident in America took place in 1969 was False. <br /><br />This one deals with whether oil spills from tankers are far more common than \"very rare leaks\" from rigs or pipelines. <br /><br />We looked at a 2009 report produced by the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, that catalogs oil spills. Indeed, the number of spills from tankers in U.S. waters is nearly two-and-a-half times higher than those of offshore oil pipelines and oil platforms combined. Tankers also dump more than three times more oil. <br /><br />Two scientists who study the ocean and environment also confirmed that tankers are responsible for more spills. <br /><br />Here's how the numbers from the American Petroleum Institute break down:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>U.S. offshore pipelines, 1969 to 2007</strong>: 506 spills, 182,355 barrels&nbsp; <span><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">p24</span></span><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>U.S. platforms, 1969 to 2007</strong>: 1,035 spills, 277,033 barrels <span><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">p24</span></span><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Oil tankers in U.S. waters</strong>: 3,774 spills, 1962 through 2007; 1,596,638 barrels <span><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">p31</span></span><br /><br />U.S. Coast Guard figures on spills differ from API data but back up the overall point that tanker spills are far worse polluters than offshore oil pipelines or platforms. <br /><br />But are leaks from rigs or pipelines \"very rare\"?&nbsp; <br /><br />The petroleum industry's own figures indicate the U.S. has averaged more than 13 pipeline spills and 27 platform spills a year. <br /><br />They're certainly less common than tanker spills, as Johnson stated. <br /><br />But platform and pipeline spills still take place roughly 40 times annually. That's a little more than three times per month. <br /><br />That's not rare at all. That's chronic. <br /><br />We rule this claim Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-23T17:05:33.995710", "ruling_date": "2010-06-24T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Candidate: Oil spills from tankers more common than \"very rare leaks\" from rigs or pipelines", "ruling_headline_slug": "candidate-oil-spills-tankers-more-common-very-rare", "ruling_link_text": "\"Very rare\"?
