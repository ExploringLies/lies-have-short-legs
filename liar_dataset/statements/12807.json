It doesn&rsquo;t matter to him that illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they&rsquo;ve been in decades, because he&rsquo;s not offering any real solutions to those issues. He&rsquo;s just offering slogans, and he&rsquo;s offering fear. He&rsquo;s betting that if he scares enough people, he might score just enough votes to win this election.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump did, in fact, call the United States &quot;a divided crime scene&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/754789482621243392\">in a tweet</a>. But for this fact-check, we&#39;re going to focus on Obama&#39;s claim about illegal immigration and crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Immigration rates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no reliable count of illegal immigration. Obviously, people coming into the United States illegally are trying to avoid detection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best indicator available is the number of people apprehended by the U.S. Border Patrol, an imperfect metric because some people can be double-counted if they are apprehended twice, for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those data show a <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/BP%20Total%20Apps%20FY1925-FY2015.pdf\">mostly steady decline</a> to 337,117 apprehensions in the 2015 fiscal year. In contrast, apprehensions peaked in 2000, when more than 1.6 million were logged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To see a lower nationwide apprehension rate you would have to go back 44 years, to 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The vast majority of those apprehensions in 2015 &mdash; 98 percent &mdash; were along the southwest border.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important caveat to note is that rates don&#39;t necessarily equate to enforcement, which has gotten stricter in recent years. Also, the number of people attempting to cross is tied to economic conditions, which aren&#39;t always under control of a president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Crime rates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrary to what <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-said-crime-rising-its-not-and-hasnt-b/\">Trump has repeatedly contended</a>, the crime rate in the United States has been on the decline for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s been some preliminary data from early 2015 and partial comparisons as late as early 2016 indicating an uptick, but the overall trend through 2014 from annual <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-1\">data compiled by the FBI</a> &mdash; using reports submitted by local law enforcement agencies &mdash; show that violent crime has been falling steadily since the early 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nLPZa2hX5rVGanxW9YbkPGkmB83WeAR9RAiHlcMTKLWQxkczrq7l6duG9KI_QxJjEBrkq0MuiofFwByfMDqqosyY18sZvUb_gJ-TBT5BiN3eM9VyreP3HHZ73rkkcN49icFkM1Y\" style=\"height:328px; width:534px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trend for property crime is similar. In addition, annual statistics collected by the Justice Department for the <a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv14.pdf\">National Crime Victimization Survey</a> shows the same trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama said, &quot;Illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they&rsquo;ve been in decades.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data generally support his claim, but the numbers aren&#39;t perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s a hint of a recent uptick in crime based on partial and preliminary data from 2015 and 2016, and estimates of illegal immigration have to rely on border patrol apprehensions because it&#39;s impossible to directly count the number of people sneaking into the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With those words of caution in mind, we rate Obama&#39;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7b8d1f60-5715-4cd5-9bf2-999919183a31\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7b8d1f60-5715-4cd5-9bf2-999919183a31</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-28T00:41:25.419449", "ruling_date": "2016-07-28T01:08:40", "ruling_headline": "Crime and illegal immigration are at decades-long lows, says Barack Obama", "ruling_headline_slug": "crime-and-illegal-immigration-are-decades-long-low", "ruling_link_text": "Numbers aren't perfect but trends are there", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/mar/17/barack-obama/barack-obama-austin-says-illegal-immigration-40-ye/\">Barack Obama, in Austin, says illegal immigration at 40-year low</a>,&quot; March 17, 2016 &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-said-crime-rising-its-not-and-hasnt-b/\">Donald Trump said, &#39;Crime is rising.&#39; It&#39;s not (and hasn&#39;t been for decades)</a>,&quot; June 7, 2016; &nbsp;&quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/26/luis-gutierrez/rep-gutierrez-says-fewer-people-crossing-border-la/\">Rep.
