Scott Walker before the end of June 2015. Walker has not stated a position on the teacher proposal but does have the power to veto individual provisions out of the budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GOP proposal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it stands now, public school teachers in Wisconsin must be licensed by the state Department of Public Instruction. A bachelor&rsquo;s degree from an accredited university is one of the minimum requirements. Teachers must also pass state tests that assess their knowledge of a subject as well as their skills in teaching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the GOP proposal, the Department of Instruction would be required to issue teaching licenses to individuals who are deemed qualified by a local school board to teach in middle or high school (sixth through 12th grade), though the license would be good only for that school district.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There would be two major changes under this alternative form of licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Anyone with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree -- in any subject, and from an accredited or non-accredited university -- could be licensed to teach the so-called core subjects of English, math, social studies or science. The only requirement would be that a school board would have to determine that the person is &quot;proficient in the subject&quot; and has &quot;relevant experience&quot; in the subject. Unlike the standard licensing system, the teacher would not have to pass any state tests to prove his or her subject knowledge or teaching knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Council on Teacher Quality, an independent research <a href=\"http://www.nctq.org/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>group</u></a>, and the Education Commission on the States said they did not know how many states have teacher standards like that one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. </strong>For non-core subjects -- such as health or foreign language -- &nbsp;no college degree, or even a high school diploma, would be required. Again, no state tests would be required, only that a school board determine that a person is &quot;proficient in the subject&quot; and has &quot;relevant experience&quot; in the subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thewheelerreport.com/wheeler_docs/files/0528popelegcouncil.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>A memo</u></a> on the GOP proposal from the Wisconsin Legislative Council, a nonpartisan research agency that serves the Legislature, says that every state requires a minimum of a bachelor&#39;s degree for all grades. The only exception is for technical education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, a spokeswoman for the National Council on Teacher Quality told us it knows of no state that doesn&#39;t require at least a bachelor&#39;s degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The only evidence the Democratic Party cited to us to back Tate&rsquo;s claim was an Associated Press <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/wisconsin-may-be-first-to-license-teachers-without-degree/305380021/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>news article</u></a> saying Wisconsin may be the first state in the country to certify teachers who don&#39;t have bachelor&#39;s degrees.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The changes were proposed by state<strong> </strong>Rep. <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2015/legislators/assembly/1268\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mary Czaja</u></a>, R-Irma. She told us she wants schools to be able to hire teachers who can &quot;fill a niche&quot; -- for example, hiring a nurse with a two-year degree to teach health, or a local mechanic to teach auto mechanics -- without having to hire a permanent teacher at a higher salary plus benefits. She said she trusts schools to hire people who are competent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sungti Hsu, of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, said the Wisconsin changes would be significant. Across the country, requiring a bachelor&rsquo;s degree to teach &quot;is pretty much a minimum requirement,&quot; he said. It&rsquo;s also important for teachers to be trained in both the subject they will teach and as teachers, Hsu said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If Wisconsin changes their requirements,&quot; he said, referring to the Republican proposal, &quot;I&rsquo;m not sure about the weakest, but it certainly would be one of the lowest requirements.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tate declared that a Republican budget proposal &quot;would have Wisconsin have the weakest standards for who can be a teacher in the classroom in the country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the proposal becomes law, Wisconsin apparently would become the only state not to have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree as a minimum requirement for teaching some subjects,<strong> </strong>including health and<strong> </strong>foreign languages. But that applies only to sixth through 12th grades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there isn&rsquo;t evidence to show that Wisconsin&rsquo;s teacher standards overall would be the weakest in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Tate&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-06-10T14:28:19.214329", "ruling_date": "2015-06-11T12:00:00", "ruling_headline": "GOP plan would give Wisconsin weakest standards in U.S. for hiring teachers, Democrat Mike Tate says", "ruling_headline_slug": "gop-plan-would-give-wisconsin-weakest-standards-us", "ruling_link_text": "Eliminating bachelor's degree requirement key change", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>WisPolitics.com, <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/1006/150528TateLuncheon.mp3\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mike Tate remarks</u></a> (quote at 26:00), May 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joint Finance Committee, <a href=\"http://pb.dpi.wi.gov/sites/default/files/imce/pb/pdf/Motion%20457%20Rep%20Ed%20Omnibus.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;K-12 Omnibus Motion&quot;</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin Legislative Council, K-12 omnibus motion <a href=\"http://www.thewheelerreport.com/wheeler_docs/files/0528popelegcouncil.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>memo</u></a>, May 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange, Wisconsin Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff, June 2, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, state Rep.
