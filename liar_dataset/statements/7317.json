PolitiFact looked at the bureau&rsquo;s annual report on <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/ucr\">&quot;Crime in the United States,&quot;</a> a collection of data from local agencies on several categories of crimes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Facebook post earned a &quot;True&quot; rating because it reflected the FBI&rsquo;s statistics from <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011\">2011</a>, the most recent year available, for murders with knives (1,694), personal weapons (728, typed on Facebook as 726), blunt objects (496) and rifles (323).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Facebook post did not include homicides the FBI attributed to handguns (6,220), firearms whose type was not stated (1,587) and &quot;other guns&quot; (97). Those numbers mean handguns were used in 72 percent of all firearm murders in 2011 and slightly under half of all murders using any kind of weapon that year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbbott&rsquo;s tweet, similarly, did not include some FBI-tracked categories by referring solely to rifles and blunt objects and leaving out other significant firearm categories. Still, according to the FBI&rsquo;s data covering <a href=\"http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/offenses/expanded_information/data/shrtable_08.html\">2005</a> through <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8\">2011</a>, blunt objects such as clubs and hammers were consistently used to murder more people than rifles alone.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFBI homicide data <a href=\"http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/offenses/expanded_information/data/shrtable_08.html\">2005</a>-<a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8\">2011</a>, ranked in order of weapons used most often in 2011:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<img height=\"447px;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/rCeEzIOT7jQtEgCODV1CoRmltBwyFyQzMUvMghgyeu1Um3GduaZzFfKpeLH-H31-nlJ9cKpwZjwJl7yo9QnzS-GgM2ptq0_I63_5os5fnDRvRQwXa6-6c4W6kA\" width=\"561px;\" /><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLike an older Facebook item, Abbott&rsquo;s tweet uses data selectively, ignoring the significant role of handguns in gun violence. That said, it is correct that FBI data indicates that in 2011, more people were killed with &quot;clubs and hammers&quot; than with any type of rifle.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his statement as True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Clarification: This story originally posted with the &quot;speaker&quot; identified as &quot;Facebook posts&quot; instead of Greg Abbott.
