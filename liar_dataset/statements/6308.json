New Hampshire is one of n<a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/efile/article/0,,id=130684,00.html\">ine states in the country without an income tax</a>. The Granite State is one of <a href=\"http://www.salestaxinstitute.com/rates.html\">five without a statewide sales tax</a>, and it&rsquo;s one of only two, along with Alaska, without either.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis leaves New Hampshire legislators leaning heavily -- too heavily, according to some -- on property taxes as a revenue source. But are the Granite State&rsquo;s property taxes really the nation&rsquo;s third highest? We decided to look at the numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCurrently, New Hampshire is one of 37 states to charge property taxes at both the state and local level.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause the local taxes vary from town to town or county to county, it&rsquo;s difficult to identify a total state property tax rate. Instead, tax analysts determine property tax rankings based on the average amounts collected from each taxpayer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd, based on 2009 data -- the most recent available -- New Hampshire property taxes do rank among the country&rsquo;s highest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2009, the U.S. Census reported the state raised about $3.2 billion in total state and local property taxes, which ranked 42nd among the 50 states. But when you spread that among all New Hampshire residents, <a href=\"http://slfdqs.taxpolicycenter.org/pages.cfm\">it works out to $2,424 per person</a>, according to calculations by the <a href=\"http://taxpolicycenter.org/index.cfm\">Tax Policy Center</a>, a collaboration between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat figure places the state third on the list -- behind only Connecticut, which averaged $2,498 per person in 2009, and New Jersey, which averaged $2,671 per person, according to the policy center.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNumbers reported by the <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/\">Tax Foundation</a> differed slightly, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/state-and-local-property-tax-collections-capita-state-fiscal-year-2009\">showing New Hampshire&rsquo;s average property tax bills at $2,440</a>. However, that figure also ranked the Granite State&rsquo;s property taxes as the third highest in the nation, also behind Connecticut and New Jersey.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese rankings may show Cilley&rsquo;s claim to be on track, but they don&rsquo;t tell the whole story behind New Hampshire&rsquo;s tax structure, analysts said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo paint a fuller picture of the Granite State&rsquo;s tax climate, voters should consider all the state and local taxes, according to Kim Rueben, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBased on the same 2009 Census data, New Hampshire ranked 23rd that year among states in terms of total local and state taxes, charging taxpayers an average of $3,765 per person, according to the center.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tComparing that average to per capita income, state taxpayers pay about 8 percent of their income in taxes, according to the Tax Foundation ranks the Granite State <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/map-state-local-tax-burdens-and-ranks-state-2009\">44th in the country in percent of income paid</a>, meaning people in 43 states pay more of their earnings in taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Property tax may be high (in New Hampshire), but there aren&rsquo;t many other taxes, so the overall tax burden is pretty low,&quot; said Nick Kasprak, a Tax Foundation analyst.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I generally find it misleading to just rank based on a specific tax,&quot; added Rueben, of the Tax Policy Center. &quot;New Hampshire will have high per capita property tax because it doesn&#39;t really have sales or income taxes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling:</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCilley&rsquo;s claim that New Hampshire has the nation&rsquo;s third highest-property taxes is spot on. Using Census data, the leading tax advocacy organizations show that New Hampshire ranks third, behind only Connecticut and New Jersey, in property tax charges. It&rsquo;s worth noting, though, that Cilley does not paint a full picture of the Granite State&rsquo;s overall tax landscape. Looking at overall tax burden, New Hampshire residents fund the government with a relatively low percentage of their incomes in comparison to other states.
