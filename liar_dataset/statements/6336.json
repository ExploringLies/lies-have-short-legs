My fear is that Mr. Gemma wants to hop on the pro-choice bandwagon as the anti-choice agenda unfolding in the House is becoming more and more unpopular.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe thought readers might want to know whether Gemma really has done a major turnaround in two years. So we took a trip back in time (actually we checked our news archive), to when Gemma announced his original candidacy June 15, 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;How would you describe a Democrat who supports gay marriage, a Democrat who is pro-life, except in cases of rape, incest and the health of the mother, a Democrat who opposes the death penalty, a Democrat who is pro-business when business is pro-Rhode Island, who is pro-labor when labor is pro-Rhode Island?&quot; he said during a speech at Providence Place mall.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe would repeat those views throughout the 2010 campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFast forward to April 16, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.920whjj.com/cc-common/podcast/single_page.html?more_page=1&amp;podcast=helenglover&amp;selected_podcast=Gemma_4_16_1334579266_11034.mp3\">On WHJJ</a>, Gemma told talk-radio host Helen Glover, &quot;I&#39;m a pro-life Democrat.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut he also made it clear that he objected to Republican efforts to put limits on what women could choose for birth control and said that his personal pro-life beliefs would not affect how he voted on the issue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&#39;m not in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade. I&#39;m not even going near there,&quot; he said. &quot;My beliefs will not affect where everyone&#39;s going here. Women have their own right to choose.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd in <a href=\"http://www.anthonygemmaforcongress.com/newsroom_view.php?id=93\">a July 5 news release</a> with the headline &quot;Anthony Gemma Outlines Women&rsquo;s Health Care Position/States He Will Defend a Woman&rsquo;s Right to Choose,&quot; Gemma said the issue of family planning choices &quot;is something I personally wrestle with everyday.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;But I know I must put my personal religious beliefs aside, and defend a women&#39;s (sic) right to choose. The actions of Republicans in Congress and state legislatures are horrifying. I could never vote for an anti-choice bill. Women must be able to make this personal decision for themselves.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statement never used the word abortion but it seemed clear he was talking about abortion rights.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSpokesman Alex Morash <a href=\"http://news.providencejournal.com/politics/2012/07/if-theres-any-doubt-ris-gemma-wants-to-make-it-clear-he-supports-a-womans-r.html\">acknowledged</a> that Gemma&#39;s position had evolved because the candidate has become &quot;more understanding of other people&#39;s beliefs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we inquired further for this story, Gemma e-mailed us a statement that said, in part: &quot;My commitments to defend a woman&rsquo;s right to choose and to preserve and strengthen Roe v. Wade are born of deep contemplation. To an appreciable degree my change was spurred by Republicans&rsquo; ongoing efforts -- supported by the likes of Brendan Doherty [the Republican running for the seat] -- to return America to a dark age when women were second-class citizens whose most intimate health choices were made by men.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, we asked NARAL Pro-Choice America about the organization&#39;s assessment of whether Gemma belonged in the &quot;pro-choice&quot; category, given his pledge and his personal feelings. Part of their response: &quot;We remain skeptical of Anthony Gemma&#39;s sudden jump to support a woman&#39;s right to choose while labeling himself as a &#39;pro-life&#39; candidate. His position contradicts how he frames his values.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNARAL Pro-Choice America said: &quot;In 2010, [Anthony] Gemma described himself as a &#39;pro-life&#39; candidate. Now he claims to be pro-choice.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&#39;s clear that Gemma&#39;s position on abortion rights has changed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe went from saying that he supported a woman&rsquo;s right to abortion only in cases of rape, incest and the health of the mother, to saying he would defend a woman&#39;s right to choose when it comes to health care and family planning options, although his statement doesn&#39;t specifically mention abortion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe may be calling himself a &quot;pro-life Democrat&quot; in the same breath, but when the candidate says, &quot;I vow to protect a woman&#39;s right to choose,&quot; he&#39;s trying to put himself in the &quot;pro-choice&quot; camp.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNARAL says Gemma changed his position after his appearance on WHJJ. Clearly it predates that. But that&#39;s a side issue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen NARAL says Gemma has gone from being a &quot;pro-life&quot; candidate to calling himself a &quot;pro-choice&quot; one, we judge that statement to be <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
