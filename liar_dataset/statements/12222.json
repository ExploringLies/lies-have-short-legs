About three dozen states have their own payday laws, including Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Barack Obama took a step toward regulating payday lenders when he signed a bill in 2010 that included the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bureau released an <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/cfpb-considers-proposal-to-end-payday-debt-traps/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>outline of payday loan rules</u></a> in 2015 and will release a more complete proposal this year. The bureau&rsquo;s goal is to make sure consumers have the ability to repay their loans -- something experts say Florida&rsquo;s law fails to do. (The bureau <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/cfpb-rules-to-rein-in-payday-lenders-wont-cap-rates-official-says-1455234595\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>can&rsquo;t cap rates</u></a> -- something only Congress or states have the authority to do.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly all of Florida&rsquo;s congressional delegation, including Murphy, signed a <a href=\"http://alceehastings.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398411\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>letter</u></a> in April 2015 asking the bureau to use Florida&rsquo;s law as a model.&nbsp;U.S. Rep.

But the loans leave consumers stuck on a debt treadmill in Florida, where they have racked up $2.5 billion in fees since 2005, according to the <a href=\"http://www.responsiblelending.org/sites/default/files/nodes/files/research-publication/crl_perfect_storm_florida_mar2016.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Center for Responsible Lending</u></a>. The center obtained data from the state Office of Financial Regulation to examine payday transaction data for a 10-year period. The average Florida payday loan had an annual rate of 278 percent in 2014-15, the center found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew Charitable Trusts, an independent organization, has researched payday laws for five years, including interviews with borrower focus groups. Borrowers consistently say they want small&nbsp;installment payments, lower prices and certainty of quick approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida has quick approval, but otherwise doesn&rsquo;t meet those benchmarks, said Alex Horowitz, senior officer with the small-dollar loans project. Colorado is the only state that achieves all three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Colorado has by far the best model for payday loans in the country,&quot; Horowitz said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Florida, loans are due back in a lump sum by the borrower&rsquo;s next payday that take up on average 35 percent of a borrower&rsquo;s paycheck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That is much more than they can afford,&quot; Horowitz said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colorado&rsquo;s 2010 law led to more affordable loan payments, fewer defaults, and lower prices, according to <a href=\"http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2014/12/trial-error-and-success-in-colorados-payday-lending-reforms\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Pew</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokesman for Murphy, Joshua Karp, pointed to a 2014 <a href=\"http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/multimedia/data-visualizations/2014/state-payday-loan-regulation-and-usage-rates\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>analysis by Pew</u></a> that placed states into three categories: 15 states have no payday laws, 27 states have permissive laws and nine states are &quot;hybrids,&quot; with requirements such as lower limits on fees or longer repayment periods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Florida&#39;s law is stronger than 27 of 35 states that allow payday lending,&quot; Karp said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Horowitz said that in most cases there is insufficient research to know if the restrictions in the nine states improve consumer welfare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Center for Responsible Lending doesn&rsquo;t consider Colorado to be a national model because it allows high interest rates, said Diane Standaert, the center&rsquo;s director of state policy. The best practice is a rate cap of 36 percent, which exists in 14 states but not Florida, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The data from Florida is it has some of weakest provisions in the country,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray, disagreed with Ross, a Florida congressman, when Ross called Florida&rsquo;s law the &quot;gold standard&quot; during a congressional hearing on March 16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Florida, &quot;these loans are still being made above the 300 percent, and they are being rolled over on average nine times,&quot; Cordray <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imfCKtAzLxA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3h7m44s\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>said</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, Florida&rsquo;s law could always be worse. For example, eight states including Wisconsin and Texas have no fee limits, while in Florida it is $35 to borrow $300 for two weeks. However, no academic or consumer expert we interviewed argued that Florida&rsquo;s law should be considered any sort of national model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One can&rsquo;t say across the board Florida is a state that has somehow reined in payday lenders in comparison with other states,&quot; said Auburn University professor James Barth who wrote a paper on payday lending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy said Florida&rsquo;s regulations on the payday lending industry are &quot;stronger than almost any other state.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consumer advocates, Pew researchers and the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have several criticisms of Florida&rsquo;s&nbsp;law, including the high interest rate. Pew, an independent organization, says that Colorado has the best model law in the country. The Center for Responsible Lending points to 14 states -- not including Florida -- that cap interest rates at 36 percent as a better practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are ways in which Florida&rsquo;s payday law is better than some other states, but there is not evidence that it&rsquo;s stronger than almost any other state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/94d22922-2180-41a8-aba1-7b81e25f833f\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/94d22922-2180-41a8-aba1-7b81e25f833f</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-04-11T15:55:11.870036", "ruling_date": "2016-04-12T14:18:07", "ruling_headline": "Patrick Murphy praises Florida's payday law as 'stronger than almost any other state'", "ruling_headline_slug": "patrick-murphy-praises-floridas-payday-law-stronge", "ruling_link_text": "Colorado beats Florida's weak law, advocates say", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Govtrack, <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr4018/summary\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Consumer Choice and Protection Act</u></a>, Referred to a House committee Nov. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida Alliance for Consumer Protection,<a href=\"http://stopthedebttrap.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/15.05.06-FL-Payday-2-Pager-Final-21.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> Press release</u></a>, May 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=f1420&amp;cycle=All&amp;recipdetail=H&amp;mem=Y\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Payday lenders</u></a>, Accessed March 28, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsible Lending, <a href=\"http://www.responsiblelending.org/sites/default/files/nodes/files/research-publication/crl_perfect_storm_florida_mar2016.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Perfect storm: Payday lenders harm Florida consumers despite state law,&quot;</u></a> March 16, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsible Lending, <a href=\"http://www.responsiblelending.org/sites/default/files/uploads/10-payday-loans.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Payday lending abuses and predatory practices,&quot; </u></a>September 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Journal of Economics and Business,<a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2581622\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> &quot;Do state regulations affect payday lender concentration?&quot; </u></a>2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/cfpb-considers-proposal-to-end-payday-debt-traps/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;CFPB Considers Proposal to End Payday Debt Traps,&quot; </u></a>March 26, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, <a href=\"http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201603_cfpb_monthly-complaint-report-vol-8.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Monthly complaint report</u></a>, March 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida Office of Financial Regulation, <a href=\"http://www.flofr.com/StaticPages/PaydayLenders.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Payday lenders</u></a>, Accessed April 11, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Rep.
