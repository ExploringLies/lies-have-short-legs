The 11-member City Council accepted her recommendation in May 2015 and Alter was eligible to begin her service a couple months later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Gallo made her motion to remove Alter from the board, Gallo <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local/gallo-seeks-to-remove-political-opponent-from-aust/nr9dh/\">said she was acting after Alter refused to resign</a>. On Aug. 4, 2016, Gallo&rsquo;s colleagues approved Gallo&rsquo;s request without discussion as part of the meeting&rsquo;s consent agenda, which typically consists of uncontroversial items that are passed in a single council vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I asked Ms. Alter to resign from the Parks and Recreation Board because of her inherent conflict of interest due to her intention to run against me for City Council,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local/gallo-seeks-to-remove-political-opponent-from-aust/nr9dh/\">Gallo said in an Aug. 4, 2016, statement.</a> &quot;It would be difficult for her to represent both me and the District 10 office in good faith while actively campaigning against me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallo made no mention then of Alter&rsquo;s attendance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this fact check, we reached out to Gallo&rsquo;s campaign &nbsp;by phone and email, seeking the factual basis for her claim that Alter&rsquo;s &quot;F&quot; for attendance preceded her removal from the board. Gallo&rsquo;s campaign cited those two missed 2016 board meetings in an email to PolitiFact, defending the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, we checked on Alter&rsquo;s attendance history by reviewing meeting minutes for the 11-member parks board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From January to July 2016, the period claimed by Gallo, the minutes indicate the board had six meetings, and a subcommittee Alter served on also had six meetings. Alter missed two of each--meaning she missed one-third of the year&rsquo;s meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s an incomplete accounting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The year before, Alter was absent from her initial full board meeting on July 28, 2015, according to <a href=\"http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=237206\">that meeting&rsquo;s minutes</a>. Yet she was present at each of her next eight meetings of the year--from Aug. 25 through Dec. 8, 2015--including three committee meetings, according to respective meeting minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All told then, Alter was present at 16 of 21 parks board or subcommittee meetings until her removal. That breaks out to a 76 percent attendance record, arguably a &lsquo;C&rsquo; letter grade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if the city in any way grades or ranks board members on attendance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At our request, city spokesman David Green emailed us the city&rsquo;s log of attendance for the parks board; it didn&rsquo;t include attendance grades or such. Green said too that the city clerk&rsquo;s office, which tracks board and council absences, doesn&rsquo;t rank or grade members on attendance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallo said Alter &quot;got an F in attendance in 2016 as a Parks Board member and was removed by a unanimous vote of the Austin City Council.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This claim gets events flat wrong in that we found no evidence that Alter&rsquo;s removal from the board--which occurred at Gallo&rsquo;s behest--had anything to do with missed meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Austin volunteers who serve on city boards don&rsquo;t get graded on attendance. Still, if Alter were graded on her entire tenure rather than a cherry-picked stretch, she&rsquo;d merit a passing grade of &lsquo;C.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous.
