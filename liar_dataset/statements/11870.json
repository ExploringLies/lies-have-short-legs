We&rsquo;ve previously rated a statement that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/09/eric-bolling/does-us-have-highest-corporate-tax-rate-free-world/\">Mostly True</a>, because the statutory corporate tax rate ranks as the world&#39;s highest. We should note, however, that deductions and exclusions usually lower the effective rate, placing the United States lower than other countries&rsquo; comparable levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Trump did not specifically say the corporate rate at the debate, so we wanted to know how high U.S. taxes stacked up to the rest of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tax tables</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax experts have told us that there are usually two ways to compare different countries: Tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product, and tax revenue per capita. We checked both through the Organization for Economic Cooperation, a group of 34 industrialized nations we could consider economic peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REV\">OECD data from 2014</a>, the most recent year available, the United States was far from the most highly taxed among this group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taxation accounted for 26 percent of GDP, which ranks America 27th out of 30 countries (the OECD average was more than 34 percent).The top five highest-taxed countries as a percentage of GDP were Denmark, France, Belgium, Finland and Italy, all topping 43 percent. Korea, Chile and Mexico were the only nations ranked lower than the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for tax revenue per capita, we move up a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>America is 17th out of 29 countries by this measure on the OECD list, with taxes totaling $14,994 per person. The top five were Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, which ranged from a high of almost $50,000 to to more than $23,000. Twelve nations were lower than the United States. The bottom two, Turkey and Chile, had tax revenues per capita of less than $3,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Industrialized economies are the best yardstick, but U.S. taxation as a percentage of GDP ranks 12th from the bottom if you compare it with a larger roster of 115 countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The World Bank&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.TAX.TOTL.GD.ZS?order=wbapi_data_value_2013+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=desc\">data for 2012</a> &mdash; the last year for which it has complete figures &mdash; showed that the nations with lower percentages than the United States were two OECD members (Japan and Spain), a couple of oil-rich countries (Oman and Kuwait) and few impoverished states (like Afghanistan and the Central African Republic).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Point being, Trump is on the wrong side of the ledger with this claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said, &quot;Right now we&rsquo;re the highest taxed country in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We used a couple of different measurements suggested by experts to determine that no matter how you slice it, the United States is far from the most taxed nation in the world, whether it&rsquo;s an advanced industrialized economy or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0fe57c6b-7f30-4095-bea2-2b7e4a3d9b33\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0fe57c6b-7f30-4095-bea2-2b7e4a3d9b33</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-06T23:48:28.339935", "ruling_date": "2016-02-06T23:50:38", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump calls U.S. 'the highest taxed country in the world'", "ruling_headline_slug": "trump-calls-us-highest-taxed-country-world", "ruling_link_text": "The rates don't add up by a long shot", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Donald Trump, comments made during ABC presidential primary debate in Manchester, N.H., Feb. 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PunditFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/09/eric-bolling/does-us-have-highest-corporate-tax-rate-free-world/\">Does the U.S. have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world?</a>,&quot; Sept. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-us-most-highly-taxed-nation-worl/\">Donald Trump says U.S. is &#39;most highly taxed nation in the world&#39;</a>,&quot; Aug. 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REV\">revenue statistics comparative tables</a>, accessed Feb. 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>World Bank, <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.TAX.TOTL.GD.ZS?order=wbapi_data_value_2012+wbapi_data_value&amp;sort=desc\">tax revenue as a percentage of GDP</a>, accessed Feb. 6, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Right now we&rsquo;re the highest taxed country in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an ABC Republican debate in New Hampshire", "statement_date": "2016-02-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
