And by the end of his term in office he will have added nearly as much public debt as all the prior presidents combined,&quot; Romney said in an April 4, 2012, speech to newspaper editors. &quot;No president has ever run a trillion-dollar deficit. The new normal the president would have us embrace is trillion-dollar deficits and 8 percent unemployment. Through all of this, President Obama has failed to even pass a budget.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are a lot of accusations packed in there, but that last one -- that Obama failed to pass a budget -- piqued our interest most.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>How the budget happens</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe federal budget doesn&rsquo;t get enacted the way other laws do. The process starts with the president submitting his budget request to Congress early in the year. That voluminous document is partly a presidential wish list, but it also gives Congress a framework.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The &lsquo;PresBud,&rsquo; as it is called, forms the basis of the fiscal year budget that starts the following October,&quot; according to this <a href=\"http://www.taxpayer.net/resources.php?category=&amp;type=Project&amp;proj_id=5198&amp;action=Wastebasket\">post</a> from the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Congress, the House and Senate have budget committees tasked with creating concurrent budget resolutions, using the president&rsquo;s budget as a guide. As Taxpayers for Common Sense wrote, &quot;The legislation they draft is for Congressional use only: it doesn&#39;t go to the President, it isn&#39;t law, it just helps Congress keep its budgetary ducks in a row.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo there is the first problem with Romney&rsquo;s statement. The president doesn&rsquo;t &quot;pass&quot; a budget. That&rsquo;s Congress&rsquo; job.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Obama&rsquo;s case, he has submitted his budget request each year he has been in office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Voting on his requests</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney said in his speech that &quot;In February, (Obama) put forward a proposal that included the largest tax increase in history and still left our national debt spiraling out of control, and the House rejected it unanimously.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&rsquo;s right about the rejection. After Obama submitted his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal on Feb. 13, 2012, House Republicans put it up for a floor vote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe result: 414-0 against.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe same thing happened a year earlier in the Senate. That vote: 97-0 against. Democrats didn&rsquo;t support the plan because it has been supplanted by another deficit-reduction plan Obama had later outlined. Republican leaders demanded a vote on Obama&rsquo;s budget to show that Democrats don&rsquo;t support any detailed budget blueprint, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/163347-senate-votes-unanimously-against-obama-budget\">according to The Hill</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSuch votes are taken &quot;just as a means of embarrassing the president and his party,&quot; said Patrick Louis Knudsen, a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Usually it&rsquo;s brought up by the opposition party because they generally anticipate that a president&rsquo;s budget won&rsquo;t get very much support especially if it has controversial elements to it,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther experts agree. Said Steve Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense: &quot;That was pure political theater and was done to score rhetorical points.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Norman Ornstein, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, &quot;it doesn&rsquo;t mean a damn thing. It&rsquo;s only a symbolic gesture.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese votes are also what Romney&rsquo;s campaign cited when we asked for documentation of his statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Everyone understands that the president has a unique and important role in facilitating that process,&quot; said spokesman Ryan Williams in an email. &quot;President Obama has been an unprecedented failure in that respect. His FY 2012 budget went down 97-0 in the Senate and his FY 2013 budget went down 414-0 in the House.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Speaking of precedent</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered what other budgetary scenarios have played out recently.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKnudsen pointed to 2009, when Democrats still held a majority in the House. They introduced a resolution that included the mechanism for the health care legislation championed by Obama in his budget. The resolution had many elements of the president&rsquo;s budget, Knudsen said, though it wasn&rsquo;t strictly speaking that document.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOrnstein referred us to the gridlock of 2011 that resulted from the debate over raising the debt ceiling. The budget control act, which was passed to avoid a default on our debt and signed by Obama wasn&rsquo;t a traditional budget resolution, Ornstein said. But he noted: &quot;That was actually a budget adopted by a president.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOrnstein also noted that during George W. Bush&rsquo;s presidency, there were years that Democrats in Congress failed to pass joint resolutions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;To suggest that was Bush not passing a budget would be a misstatement,&quot; Ornstein said. He called Romney&rsquo;s rap on Obama &quot;at best a gross exaggeration.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in Knudsen&rsquo;s view, Romney&rsquo;s statement was &quot;technically accurate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The president&rsquo;s budgets have been brought to the floor twice and they have failed,&quot; Knudsen said. &quot;It&rsquo;s not atypical that that should happen, but nevertheless the governor is correct.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact has examined similar accusations about a lack of budgeting when they&rsquo;ve been leveled at Congress. In January 2012, Republican House member Paul Ryan charged that Senate Democrats &quot;have gone without any budget at all&quot; for more than 1,000 days. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/02/paul-ryan/democrat-controlled-us-senate-has-gone-nearly-thre/\">PolitiFact Wisconsin rated that Mostly True</a>, finding he was slightly off about the number of days but correct that the Democrat-controlled Senate had gone a long time with passing a budget resolution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFormer Louisiana Congressman and Gov. Buddy Roemer <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/05/buddy-roemer/obama-submitted-budgets/\">earned a Half True</a> from us when he said in July 2011 that &quot;Obama has never submitted a budget, and Congress has worked for two years without passing one.&quot; He was right about Congress but wrong about Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his speech, Romney faulted Obama for failing to pass a budget. He was correct that the two times Congress voted on the president&rsquo;s budget requests, both times they were voted down. But the job of passing a budget resolution is not the president&rsquo;s. That responsibility falls to Congress, and even then the president doesn&rsquo;t sign it. As Ellis, our expert, put it: &quot;The president has no role in passing a budget. The president can cajole Congress about passing a budget and advocate for positions and funding levels, but in the end, Congress approves the budget resolution for their own purposes.&quot; That&rsquo;s the difference between this and other claims we&rsquo;ve rated which blamed Congress for inaction on the budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney&rsquo;s statement contains a grain of truth, in that two of Obama&rsquo;s budget requests failed to pass. But citing those votes leaves a wrong impression -- namely that the votes were anything more than political theater. Romney omitted the more critical information that passing a federal budget is the job of Congress. Given all that, we rate his statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-06T11:28:40.380983", "ruling_date": "2012-04-06T13:27:55", "ruling_headline": "Romney says Obama failed to pass a budget", "ruling_headline_slug": "romney-says-obama-failed-pass-budget", "ruling_link_text": "Passing budget not president's task", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRomney remarks to Newspaper Association of America, April 4, 2012, transcript accessed via CQ.com</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTaxpayers for Common Sense, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.taxpayer.net/resources.php?category=&amp;type=Project&amp;proj_id=5198&amp;action=Wastebasket\">Tempest in a Teapot</a>,&quot; March 23, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Steve Ellis, <a href=\"http://www.taxpayer.net/about.php?action=staff#steve\">Taxpayers for Common Sense</a>, April 4 &amp; 5, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Patrick Louis Knudsen, <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/k/patrick-knudsen\">Heritage Foundation</a>, April 5, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Norman Ornstein, <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/scholar/norman-j-ornstein/\">American Enterprise Institute</a>, April 5, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Ryan Williams, Romney campaign, April 5, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>The Hill</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/163347-senate-votes-unanimously-against-obama-budget\">President&#39;s budget sinks, 97-0</a>,&quot; May 25, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/05/buddy-roemer/obama-submitted-budgets/\">Roemer faults Obama and Congress on budgets</a>,&quot; Aug. 5, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Wisconsin, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/02/paul-ryan/democrat-controlled-us-senate-has-gone-nearly-thre/\">Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate has gone nearly three years without a budget, GOP Rep.
