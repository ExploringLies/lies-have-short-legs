Ted Strickland and incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/senate/oh/ohio_senate_portman_vs_strickland-5386.html\">neck-in-neck</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strickland&rsquo;s latest tactic against Portman is to call him out for serving the billionaire class at the expense of Ohio&rsquo;s regular Joes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A campaign fundraising email from Strickland&rsquo;s campaign manager portrays Portman in the grips of dark outside spending, while Strickland takes in small donations from voters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While Rob Portman relies on his super PAC and a handful of billionaires to do his dirty work, we don&rsquo;t have a super PAC,&quot; wrote campaign manager&nbsp;Rebecca Pearcey, &quot;and quite frankly, we don&rsquo;t want one that spends millions to spew out lies and distortions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recalled a similar claim by presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, whose own statement about not having a super PAC was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/30/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-only-presidential-candidates-withou/\">fact-checked</a> in the early months of the Democratic primary. We applied the same test to Strickland&rsquo;s campaign rhetoric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portman has an affiliated super PAC, meaning it&rsquo;s dedicated solely to supporting him and opposing Strickland. Fighting for Ohio (though it&rsquo;s registered in Alexandria, Va.) has spent more than $1.68 million against Strickland so far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top contributors to Fighting for Ohio include <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/elitestreet/ct-elite-street-ken-griffin-0114-biz-20160110-story.html\">Kenneth Griffin</a>, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel ($250,000); <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/paul-singer/\">Paul Singer</a>, hedge fund manager of Elliott Management Corporation ($250,000); Edyth Lindner, widow of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/lindner/\">Carl Lindner</a>, former owner of the Cincinnati Reds and Chiquita Brands ($100,000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, Portman is funded by billionaires. But Strickland&rsquo;s appeal for cash neglects to mention how he also benefits from outside spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00484642&amp;cycle=2016\">Senate Majority PAC </a>is an unaffiliated funder that pledges its support to Democrats running for the Senate. The PAC mostly pays for TV and digital attack ads against Republican candidates. In this election season, the PAC has lasered in on four major Senate battlegrounds: New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Ohio. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donors to the Senate Majority PAC include <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-01/bay-area-broker-becomes-billionaire-on-sub-10-million-listings\">George Marcus</a>, real estate broker at Marcus &amp; Millichap ($1 million); <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0930/400096.html\">Fred Eychaner</a>, Newsweb Corporation founder ($1 million); and actor/director&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kiss-and-family-guy-announce-licensing-deal-20120614\">Seth MacFarlane</a>&nbsp;($500,000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/01/428127299/empire-strikes-pac-and-other-punny-superpac-names\">Anyone </a>can register an unaffiliated super PAC with the Federal Election Commission. This means even if the Senate Majority PAC&rsquo;s love for Strickland was unrequited, there&rsquo;s not much Strickland can do about it.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s illegal for a candidate to coordinate with a super PAC, according to the Federal Election Commission rules. But such rules are <a href=\"https://www.publicintegrity.org/2012/01/13/7866/rules-against-coordination-between-super-pacs-candidates-tough-enforce\">rarely enforced</a>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;since 1999, commissioners have only launched three investigations on candidate-super PAC contact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike Sanders, who filed a <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2393712/bernie-sanders-campaign-letters-to-cary-lee.pdf\">cease-and-desist</a> order against a PAC backing him, Strickland hasn&#39;t disavowed the&nbsp;$1.75 million that the Senate Majority PAC has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/indexpend.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00484642\" style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">spent&nbsp;</a>so far on the race&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.senatemajority.com/2016/04/news/releases/senate-majority-pac-to-launch-new-ohio-advertising-campaign/\" style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">targeting</a>&nbsp;Portman.

But big spenders still have Strickland&rsquo;s back.
