There&#39;s another ad in the Republican primary for governor accusing Rick Scott of fraud.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis one comes from the Bill McCollum-backed group Florida First Initiative. But the subject isn&#39;t Columbia/HCA, the for-profit hospital company Scott helped build to become the nation&#39;s largest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis ad is talking about some other, unnamed company.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad is called &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLFbsvL1SyI\" id=\"d8qc\" title=\"Private\">Private</a>.&quot; It opens with a narrator talking over newspaper headlines.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Rick Scott&#39;s company pleaded guilty to one of the largest Medicare frauds in American history,&quot; the narrator says, referring to Columbia/HCA. Then, the screen flips to an image of Scott ripped from one of his commercials. It shows Scott saying: &quot;And as CEO, I take responsibility.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe narrator returns. &quot;And now, reporters have uncovered another Scott company accused of criminal acts. But Scott won&#39;t come clean.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVideo returns to Scott. &quot;It&#39;s a private matter,&quot; an angry-looking Scott says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen, the narrator responds. &quot;Rick Scott, it&#39;s not a private matter. It&#39;s a failure of character.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad&#39;s final frame includes big type that spells out &quot;Rick Scott,&quot; only the C and O of Scott&#39;s last name have been replaced by handcuffs. As the ad ends, the handcuffs interlock. If our meter measured tackiness, that over-the-top symbolism would rate pretty high, but in this case we can only examine the facts surrounding the ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we decided to look at this statement: &quot;Reporters have uncovered another Scott company accused of criminal acts. But Scott won&#39;t come clean.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Scott company background</b><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe narrator doesn&#39;t identify the company in question by name, but when he makes the claim a tearsheet of an Aug. 5, 2010, <em>St. Petersburg Times </em>article appears on the screen.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe article is titled &quot;Lawsuits point to trouble at Rick Scott&#39;s current health care business.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat headline refers to <a href=\"http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/2010/08/lawsuits-point-to-trouble-at-rick-scotts-current-health-care-business.html\" id=\"d97q\" title=\"this story\">this story</a> about a company Scott co-founded in 2001, Solantic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSolantic is a chain of walk-in urgent care centers, primarily around northeast Florida. <a href=\"http://www.solantic.com/history.php\" id=\"g25_\" title=\"The company currently operates 30 walk-in centers across the state\">The company currently operates 30 walk-in centers across the state</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe article, which was written by the<i> Miami Herald</i> and <i>St. Petersburg Times</i> reported that Scott was deposed in a Solantic civil suit just six days before he announced his bid for governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe suit, brought by Dr. P. Mark Glencross, alleged that Glencross&#39; medical license was misused by the Jacksonville-based chain of walk-in clinics. Glencross said Solantic, without his knowledge, used his name in 2004 when it filed state paperwork designed to ensure that clinics have a medical director in charge.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWithin a month of Scott&#39;s deposition, the 2-year-old case was settled and both parties signed a confidentiality agreement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe story went on to mention nine other court actions filed against Solantic since 2001, which were settled. Solantic chief executive Karen Bowling told <i>Herald/Times</i> reporter Marc Caputo that Solantic settled the cases at the request of its insurance company, which found protracted court fights too expensive.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA spokesman for Scott noted that while he is a major investor in Solantic, he doesn&#39;t run its day-to-day operations, and that Scott was involved in only two of the suits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA few days later, on Aug. 10, Scott appeared at a Tallahassee press conference where reporters asked him repeatedly if he would release the sealed deposition in the Glencross case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s when Scott provided the line used in the Florida First Initiative ad: &quot;It&#39;s a private matter,&quot; he said. Later in the press conference he said: &quot;It&#39;s a private matter and I will not release the deposition.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Glencross case is civil, not criminal</b><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBased on the whole of the ad -- the words of the narrator, the clips flashed on the screen, and the choice of Scott&#39;s words -- viewers and fact-checkers are left to assume that the ad is talking about the Solantic/Glencross case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn that case, there are two large distortions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, the Solantic/Glencross case is a civil matter, not a criminal one. There are no charges of criminal wrongdoing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecond, the allegation that Scott won&#39;t come clean is misleading. He gave a deposition.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe just has said he won&#39;t share that deposition with reporters. He has no legal requirement to do so, either.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe tried to reach the registered agent of Florida First Initiative, J. Nottingham, for an explanation. But the number on file at the Florida Division of Elections rang dead.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe should note that there is another allegation surrounding Solantic currently making news. Another former Solantic physician, Dr. Randy Prokes, sent an e-mail to the McCollum campaign claiming that Solantic billed Medicare at full rates for patients seen by a nurse practitioner, when federal rules require that billing be at 85 percent of the fee paid for physician examinations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe McCollum campaign passed the letter on to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_politics/2010/08/fdle-passes-solantic-complaint-to-the-feds.html\" id=\"z4l0\" title=\"The FDLE then sent the letter onto the inspector general\u2019s office at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\">The FDLE then sent the letter on to the inspector general&rsquo;s office at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s where the letter sits today. There is no formal investigation. Solantic executives, meanwhile, have described Prokes as a disgruntled former employee who was fired in 2009 for fraudulently prescribing drugs last year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven if Prokes&#39; claim has merit, it&#39;s not what the Florida First Initiative ad is referencing based on the ads visuals and wording. So we&#39;re not considering it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<b>Our ruling</b><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad says that &quot;reporters have uncovered another Scott company accused of criminal acts. But Scott won&#39;t come clean.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe line refers to a civil lawsuit involving Solantic, a company Scott co-founded, and Dr. Gary Glencross. Glencross alleged that his medical license was misused by the Jacksonville-based chain of walk-in clinics. A month after Scott gave a deposition in the case, it was settled. Terms of the settlement are confidential.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe case was a civil one, not criminal. And Scott provided a deposition as required. The only instance of him failing to &quot;come clean&quot; is not providing the results of that deposition to the public. Which he doesn&#39;t have to. We rate the accusation False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-20T14:57:56.275106", "ruling_date": "2010-08-20T16:38:45", "ruling_headline": "Bill McCollum group attacks Rick Scott's new health care company Solantic", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-mccollum-group-attacks-rick-scotts-new-health", "ruling_link_text": "It was a civil case, and Scott cooperated", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tFlorida First Initiative, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLFbsvL1SyI\" id=\"fmrj\" title=\"Private\">Private</a>,&quot; Aug. 17, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRick Scott campaign, e-mail interviews with Jennifer Baker, Aug. 19, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSolantic, <a href=\"http://www.solantic.com/history.php\" id=\"f:9_\" title=\"history of the company\">history of the company</a>, accessed Aug. 20, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSt. Petersburg Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/2010/08/lawsuits-point-to-trouble-at-rick-scotts-current-health-care-business.html\" id=\"md2w\" title=\"Lawsuits point to trouble at Rick Scott's current health care business\">Lawsuits point to trouble at Rick Scott&#39;s current health care business</a>,&quot; Aug. 5, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSt. Petersburg Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/article1114292.ece\" id=\"cwhq\" title=\"Defiant Rick Scott assails suit over sealed testimony, says McCollum abusing power\">Defiant Rick Scott assails suit over sealed testimony, says McCollum abusing power</a>,&quot; Aug. 11, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuval County court records, <a href=\"https://showcase.duvalclerk.com/ViewCaseDetails.aspx?id=8928690&amp;court=0\" id=\"pcou\" title=\"Solantic v.
