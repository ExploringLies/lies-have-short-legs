The competing &quot;8-2-1&quot; proposal would set up eight district representatives and two citywide seats plus the mayor, the story said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrientos&rsquo; statement could be read as implying that leaders who are elected citywide actually represent only the interests of the area where they live, a contention that we don&#39;t find factually checkable. So we looked into his declared percentages.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe told us by phone that he relied on information from Peck Young, who according to the Sept. 15 <em>Statesman</em> story leads the Geographic Representation group and has advocated for district representation since the 1970s.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYoung told us in a phone interview that the group was hungry for data on this topic last year as it researched proposals. The information behind Barrientos&rsquo; statement, he said, came from a <a href=\"http://www.theaustinbulldog.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=150%3Aat-large-elections-favor-anglo-choices&amp;catid=3%3Amain-articles&amp;Itemid=1\">map</a> and research that appeared Aug. 4, 2011, on an investigative reporting website, <a href=\"http://www.theaustinbulldog.org/\">The Austin Bulldog</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYoung&rsquo;s group spot-checked the data against city records, found it reliable and &quot;ran with it,&quot; he said. Separately, Austin city demographer Ryan Robinson told us he also found the research, compiled by Bulldog editor Ken Martin, to be reliable: &quot;He really did his due diligence.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom 1971 through 2011, Young said, 55 percent of Austin&rsquo;s elected officials lived in four ZIP codes -- 78701, 78703, 78731 and 78759. The 10 percent population figure, he said, was derived from the 2010 Census totals for Austin and for those four ZIP codes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Bulldog&rsquo;s description of its <a href=\"http://www.theaustinbulldog.org/index.php?option=com_gmapspro2&amp;task=viewmap&amp;mapid=1&amp;controller=maps\">research</a> said, &quot;This map indicates where every person who served on the Austin City Council from 1971 through 2011 lived at the time they were elected.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Bulldog report said its research started with 1971 because that was the year voters started electing the mayor. Previously, mayors were chosen by council votes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat gave a total of 17 mayors and 100 council members, according to the Bulldog <a href=\"http://www.theaustinbulldog.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=150%3Aat-large-elections-favor-anglo-choices&amp;catid=3%3Amain-articles&amp;Itemid=1\">analysis</a>, which argued that Austin power has been too concentrated in select areas. &quot;Forty-nine of those seats were won by people who lived in West and Northwest Austin,&quot; the Bulldog said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Kk_AiSJO947tBUPpnVmoZut40Gh_RXOWBb38QbbPPM/edit\">spot-checked</a> a dozen addresses shown in the Bulldog&rsquo;s<a href=\"http://www.theaustinbulldog.org/index.php?option=com_gmapspro2&amp;task=viewmap&amp;mapid=1&amp;controller=maps\"> interactive map</a> and found only minor discrepancies. For instance, former Council Member Brigid Shea told us by telephone that she moved from the French Place neighborhood, which has the 78722 ZIP code, to the 78701 address shown for her by the Bulldog about two years into her council term. The Bulldog website asks that readers send notice of any mistakes they spot; we make the same request.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor more detail, Young pointed us to Martin, who founded the Bulldog in 2010 after journalism &nbsp;jobs including editor of the Austin Business Journal and past founder-owner of a City Hall news service, InFact Daily.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMartin told us in a phone interview that his starting point was a similar project that city demographer Robinson worked on in the 2000s. He supplemented that information with more city records and candidate financial statements, interviews and historical materials including old Austin phonebooks, Martin said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to his data, which he called up on his computer and crunched for us during the interview, those four ZIP codes accounted for 58 of the 117 city offices filled in Austin elections (City Council including mayor) from 1971 through 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat divides out to 49.6 percent, not 55 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Young for help clarifying the discrepancy, and he sent us calculations that he said were made by a volunteer during the group&rsquo;s research. From that <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2Wzr4_cemD5QXMwOHRjcEkxd00\">spreadsheet</a>, it appears mayors were double-counted by adding the number of mayors to the number of &quot;council members,&quot; a category that in Martin&rsquo;s data already included mayors. If mayors are double-counted, our math shows a result of 54.9 percent; if the mayors are, properly, counted once, we get 49.6 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYoung said the double-counting explanation seemed likely to him. &quot;You and Ken may have found out my young person, who was a college student, had made a boo-boo,&quot; he said. But, he said, &quot;58 is still half of all city elected officials that have come from these four ZIP codes in 40 years. So our basic point is still true even if our math is faulty.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also wondered whether the cited ZIP codes had been home to 10 percent of Austinites throughout those decades.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGeographic Representation group spokeswoman Jessica Ellison said their research was limited to 2010 because they didn&rsquo;t have Census numbers for all 40 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrientos&rsquo; statement could be read as applying to the entire period, though, so we decided to check as best we could.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA 2010 <a href=\"http://2010.census.gov/2010census/popmap/\">U.S. Census Bureau breakdown</a> of the nation&rsquo;s most populous cities gave Austin&rsquo;s population as 790,390. So a tenth would be 79,390.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeginning in 2000, the Census Bureau has used ZIP Code Tabulation Areas rather than ZIP codes for its calculations, in order to have clearly defined boundaries that didn&rsquo;t move as postal delivery logistics changed. An individual ZCTA (which the Census Bureau <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/geo/ZCTA/zctafaq.html#Q1\">says</a> you should pronounce ZIK-tah) is roughly equivalent, though not identical, to its corresponding ZIP code.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe 2010 counts for ZCTAs corresponding to the four ZIP codes are: 78701 population 6,841; 78703 population 19,690; 78731 population 24,614; and 78759 population 38,891.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese add up to 90,036 people, or 11.4 percent of Austin&rsquo;s 2010 population.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobinson and Census librarian Asheleigh Perry told us the city and the Census Bureau Library don&rsquo;t have 1970-1990 Austin populations by ZIP code.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe did find on the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov\">Census website</a> the 2000 ZCTA counts that correspond to the 2010 numbers above. Those totals are: 78701 population 3,855; 78703 population 19,585; 78731 population 24,059; and 78759 population 1,530.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat adds up to 49,029; divide by Austin&rsquo;s 2000 population of 656,562 and you get 7.5 percent -- an even smaller slice of the city than in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPopulation numbers aside, Robinson told us he believed the overall point is valid: Council members &quot;have indeed come from a concentrated part of the city,&quot; he said. &quot;The distribution of mayors over time has been even more concentrated.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrientos wrote, &quot;10 percent of the population lives in an area that receives 55 percent of the representation,&quot; citing the system in place since 1971. Young later specified that the area is four ZIP codes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLeaving out the implication that officials only advocate for their home neighborhoods, the 55 percent calculation is slightly off due to a double-counting of mayors. All told, it looks like 50 percent of Austin&rsquo;s council members (including mayors) have come from those ZIPs over the past four decades.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2010, the ZIPs were home to 11 percent of the city&rsquo;s population; in 2000, the ZIPs were home to 7 percent of the city&rsquo;s population, arguably reinforcing Barrientos&rsquo; point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Barrientos&rsquo; statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-25T15:17:11.841637", "ruling_date": "2012-10-25T15:36:56", "ruling_headline": "Gonzalo Barrientos says 55% of council members have come from area where only 10% of Austinites live", "ruling_headline_slug": "gonzalo-barrientos-says-55-council-members-come-ar", "ruling_link_text": "Since '71, 50% from 4 ZIP codes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<em>Austin American-Statesman</em> opinion column by former state Sen.
