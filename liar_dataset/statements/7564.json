Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., in a December interview on MSNBC.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHas Bloomberg? Close. But not quite.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe NRA pointed us to a <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bloomberg-blasts-nra-connecticut-actions/story?id=18029157#.UVHS51vwLU5\"><em>Nightline</em> interview</a> on Dec. 20, 2012, in which the mayor says if you need more than three bullets, you&rsquo;re a lousy shot.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnchor Cynthia McFadden asked him about the challenge of defining an &quot;assault weapon.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Well, if it can fire a lot of bullets very quickly, that&#39;s a good place to start, okay, and then you can argue about what a lot is,&quot; Bloomberg said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMcFadden starts to interject, and the mayor continues:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Let&#39;s pick it. Let&#39;s say three. If you haven&#39;t hit the deer with three shots, you&#39;re a pretty lousy shot. The deer deserves to get away. Let&#39;s get serious here.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLater, he says:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;If it&#39;s 30 bullets, or 20 bullets or 10 bullets before you run out, I would suggest, God wants that deer to live.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMcFadden says: &quot;But according to gun owners, what you&#39;ve just described would ban most guns used by hunters today.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBloomberg: &quot;If that&#39;s what they&#39;re using, for God sakes, why aren&#39;t they using dynamite? Just make it easier. I mean, what&#39;s the sport?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDid that interview constitute a proposal to ban more than three bullets?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNot according to Bloomberg&rsquo;s spokesman, John McCarthy, who shared the Bloomberg <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2013a%2Fpr028-13.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1\">speech</a> and <a href=\"http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve/?File_id=bec13d44-82ea-4090-bb40-d913f4728929\">letter</a> supporting <a href=\"http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/assault-weapons-ban-summary\">legislation</a> to ban magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Everything we have proposed has been very public. We have never proposed that,&quot; McCarthy said. &nbsp;&quot;We have been very clear about what we have wanted and have seven years&#39; worth of public advocacy, reports, press releases and more. We have never called for that, nor did he in that interview.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>&lsquo;Firearms with nukes&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDid Bloomberg say &quot;the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them&quot;?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlmost.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe said the group would support the right to own them.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s what he told MSNBC anchor Mika Brzezinski on Dec. 18, 2012&rsquo;s <em>Morning Joe</em>:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;The U.S. Army has a rifle &mdash; they call it a rifle. I would call it a cannon. It&rsquo;s attached to the front of a tank or a moving vehicle,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;It shoots a nuclear warhead. The NRA would say, &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a gun. And people have a right to have that.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(We searched for a sign the NRA would indeed say such a thing. At the moment, the group <a href=\"http://www.nraila.org/legislation/federal-legislation/2012/feinstein-goes-for-broke-with-new-gun-ban-bill.aspx\">pokes fun at the idea</a>. Meanwhile, it <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2013/01/18/169526687/the-decades-old-gun-ban-thats-still-on-the-books\">once blessed a ban</a> on fully automatic machine guns, much less ones with nuclear warheads. Still, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-sugarmann/the-nras-flip-flop-on-mac_b_2741689.html\">soon afterward</a> it said it supported &quot;the right of law-abiding individuals to choose to own any firearm, including automatic firearms.&quot;)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhy did Bloomberg think the NRA would support a nuclear-armed populace?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;The NRA used to support background checks, and now they don&#39;t,&quot; McCarthy said. &quot;The mayor was using a rhetorical device to point out that if you oppose every regulation, you will allow anything.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLaPierre claimed that Bloomberg has said &quot;we can only have three bullets&quot; and &quot;the NRA wants firearms with nukes on them.&quot; He&rsquo;s partially right.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBloomberg suggested on MSNBC that the NRA would support the right to carry a cannon firing nuclear warheads &mdash; but his point was that the organization always supports gun rights, not that it was actively promoting nuclear weapons. And while he hasn&rsquo;t formally proposed a three-bullet maximum, he does support banning magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and has said anyone who needs more than three is &quot;a pretty lousy shot.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLaPierre hits the target, but it&rsquo;s no bull&rsquo;s-eye.
