I don&rsquo;t think those kind of comments help in this effort to draw more friends to our effort. But certainly there is a war being waged by terrorists of different types and nature across the world. And we want, as a civilized world, to participate with other nations in this civilized effort to help those nations reject the extreme within them. That doesn&#39;t mean our troops are going to go all over the world.&quot;</em></blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA Romney campaign <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=96002\">news release</a> in December 2007 said, &quot;Sen.

He says he wants to unilaterally go in and potentially bomb a nation which is our friend.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStephanopoulos pushed for details: &quot;But if your CIA director called you and said we have Osama bin Laden in our sights, Musharraf says no. What do you do?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney responded:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<em>&quot;It&#39;s wrong for a person running for the president of the United States to get on TV and say we&#39;re going to go into your country unilaterally.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Of course, America always maintains our option to do whatever we think is in the best interest of America. But we don&#39;t go out and say, ladies and gentlemen of Germany, if ever there was a problem in your country and we didn&#39;t think you were doing the right thing, we reserve the right to come in and get him out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We don&#39;t say those things. We keep our options quiet. We do not go out and say to a nation which is working with us, where we&#39;ve collaborated and they are our friend, and we&#39;re trying to support Musharraf and strengthen him and his nation, that instead that we intend to go in there and potentially bring out a unilateral attack.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Recognize, to win the war on jihad, we have to not only have a strong military on our own and we need a stronger military, we also need to have strong friends around the world and help moderate Muslims reject the extreme. Because ultimately, the only people who can finally defeat these radical Islamic Jihadists are the Muslims themselves.&quot;</em></blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStephanopoulos clarified: &quot;So ... what I&#39;m hearing is you keep this option on the table, but it was foolish to talk about it in public.
