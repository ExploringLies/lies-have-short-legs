The statement on Clayton&rsquo;s website, which suggests homeowners could pay lower property taxes than any other part of metro Atlanta, intrigued us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia called Wade Starr, a former state representative from Clayton who now manages the county&rsquo;s government operations. He said the statement was probably posted on the website a long time ago, based on some outdated information.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It needs to be updated, probably,&quot; Starr said. &quot;Right now, I think there would be some other counties that would be lower than we are.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to take a look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor those unfamiliar with the term millage rate, it is a formula governments use to determine how much property owners in a city or county should pay in taxes for police, firefighters and other government services. One &quot;mill&quot; equals $1 of property taxes for every $1,000 of assessed value. In Clayton County, the net 2012 tax year millage rate was 14.918.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia reviewed the most recent government millage rates we found in some counties that either border Clayton or have a population of similar size.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Cherokee County, which has a population slightly smaller than Clayton&rsquo;s, the millage rate for operations, fire and a parks bond was lower, at 9.99 mills. Henry County, which abuts Clayton and &nbsp;has about the same population, raised its millage rate this year to 14.5 mills. In Cobb County, the millage rate was 11.11. DeKalb County&rsquo;s millage rate was higher than Clayton&rsquo;s, at 21.21. These millage rates do not include school operations, which are typically higher than the government operations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStarr said the recession, which officially began in 2008, hit the Clayton housing market worse than other counties. In 2008, Clayton had the region&#39;s largest price drop, with homes falling 43 percent in value, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&rsquo;s Home Sales Report. The county&#39;s typical appraised value for 2010 was $90,589, according to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution analysis, a decline of 25 percent from the prior year. The typical sale price, meanwhile, was $80,656.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStarr talked about the decline in home values with us, saying he paid about $2,400 in property taxes in 2009. In 2011, Starr said he again paid about $2,400 in property taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2008, Clayton&rsquo;s net millage rate was 8.962 mills, according to county records. That&rsquo;s about 6 mills less than it is now. Around that time, the millage rate was the second-lowest among the five highest-populated counties in the region, according to a comparison done by Fulton County. Cobb had the lowest rate, the comparison showed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStarr said the information on that part of Clayton&rsquo;s website was probably posted around that time. He said there was other information on that part of the website, such as the county&rsquo;s population, that could be traced to that time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStarr said Friday that the claim about the millage rate would be removed from the county&rsquo;s website. We checked on Monday and it was gone.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn closing, the county&rsquo;s website claimed it had the lowest operating millage rate in metro Atlanta. That information, the county now says, was based on outdated information and was going to be removed. Kudos to Clayton for correcting the information. The claim was False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-11-13T15:27:33.649535", "ruling_date": "2012-11-14T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Officials correct outdated claim", "ruling_headline_slug": "officials-correct-outdated-claim", "ruling_link_text": "Maybe this was right a few years ago.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tClayton County <a href=\"http://www.claytoncountyga.gov/about/facts.aspx\">facts</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;Housing slump uneven, but wide,&quot; May 24, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;Foreclosures, frustration define Clayton&#39;s market,&quot; Dec. 20, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClayton County government Fiscal Year 2013 <a href=\"http://www.claytoncountyga.gov/pdfs/finance/FY13Budget.pdf\">budget</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tClayton County budget hearing <a href=\"http://www.claytoncountyga.gov/media/275258-5_yr_history_fy_2012.pdf\">notice</a>, July 26, 2011.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCherokee County millage <a href=\"http://www.cherokeega.com/departments/department.cfm?displaySection=Millage%20Rates.txt&amp;departmentid=31\">rates</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDeKalb County government tax commissioner&rsquo;s office millage <a href=\"http://web.co.dekalb.ga.us/TaxCommissioner/pdf/millage.pd\">information</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t2012 Fulton County <a href=\"http://www.fultoncountyga.gov/images/stories/Finance/Budget/FC_Budget_2012.pdf\">budget</a>, Page 15.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGwinnett County government millage rate <a href=\"http://gwinnetttaxcommissioner.manatron.com/Tabs/Property/BillingInformation/MillageRateInformation.aspx\">information</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHenry Herald, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.henryherald.com/news/2012/aug/01/boc-raises-millage-rate/\">BOC raises millage rate</a>,&quot; Aug. 1, 2012.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTelephone interviews with Clayton County government manager Wade Starr, Nov. 5 and 9, 2012.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 2083, "last_name": "Clayton County Government", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "clayton-county-government", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Clayton_County_government.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2083/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Clayton County offers the lowest operating millage rate in Metro Atlanta.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a web post", "statement_date": "2012-11-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
