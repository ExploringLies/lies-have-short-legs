Scott Walker&#39;s state budget proposal -- and claims Walker &quot;has been rated America&rsquo;s most factually-challenged politician.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A belittling label, even coming from the opposing party, for a Republican <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>who is formulating a 2016 run for the White House</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we&rsquo;re in the fact-checking business, we wondered what the party was using as its source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turns out it&#39;s us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flattering. But we&rsquo;ve never done that kind of rating. And the party&rsquo;s analysis has some big<strong> </strong>holes in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ratings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The party&rsquo;s statement links to <a href=\"http://wisdems.org/news/press/view/2014-10-fact-check-scott-walkers-trouble-with-the-truth-2\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a post</u></a> on its website from October 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That earlier post cites a January 2014<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/georgia/article/2014/jan/29/top-10-fact-checked-people-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>article</u></a> by PolitiFact National about the 10 most-fact-checked people on the Truth-O-Meter at the time. The article tallied all PolitiFact fact checks -- those done by PolitiFact National (since 2007), as well as PolitiFact Wisconsin (since 2010) and the other PolitiFact state operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Barack Obama topped the list, with 500 fact checks. Coming in ninth, with 85 fact checks, was Walker -- just behind Hillary Clinton and ahead of U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Democratic Party said that, based on the tallies, 54 percent of the 85 Walker statements had been rated Mostly False, False or Pants on Fire -- and that that percentage was higher than anyone else on the top 10 list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK. But there are several problems with using our ratings to make the claim the party did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first is obvious. The Democrats based their claim on only the top 10 list, which -- as one might expect -- was dominated by politicians who ran for president or were from states that had PolitiFact operations. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That ignores all of the other office holders, former office holders and candidates around the country that PolitiFact has fact checked -- including more than 130 such politicians<strong> </strong>in Wisconsin alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More importantly, we don&#39;t rate politicians in the way the Democratic Party&#39;s claim suggests. We don&rsquo;t rate every single claim a person makes. Rather, we choose a statement based largely on whether it is interesting and timely, and we give it a rating based on our research and reporting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And those ratings apply to the individual statements. We don&#39;t make sweeping generalizations about a politician&#39;s overall facility with the facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some notes before we close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To date, PolitiFact has fact-checked<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/scott-walker/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>130 Walker statements</u></a>. Just over 51 percent of them have been rated True, Mostly True or Half True; nearly 49 percent have been rated Mostly False, False, or Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, we have previously rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>18 claims</u></a> from the Wisconsin Democratic Party. One was rated True and one was rated Half True; the other 16 were rated Mostly False, False or Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few days ago, PolitiFact National put in one snapshot a summary of the Truth-O-Meter records of Walker and nine other likely presidential candidates for 2016. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/mar/24/scorecards-so-far/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Check it out</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state Democratic Party said Walker &quot;has been rated America&rsquo;s most factually-challenged politician.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the party misuses our data to claim we said something we never did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim, our rating is Pants on Fire.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-testing-claim-from-state-democrats-on-scott-walker-and-the-truth-b99469695z1-297724501.html\">web page</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>------</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More on Scott Walker</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\"> Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#39;s Scott Walker page</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-03-26T12:32:59.182536", "ruling_date": "2015-03-27T08:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Has PolitiFact rated Scott Walker the nation's \"most factually-challenged\" politician?", "ruling_headline_slug": "has-scott-walker-been-rated-most-factually-challen", "ruling_link_text": "Party cites us, but we don't do that kind of rating", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview, Wisconsin Democratic Party communications director Melissa Baldauff, March 20, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WisDems.org, <a href=\"http://wisdems.org/news/blog/view/2015-03-more-bad-news-for-working-families-in-scott-walkers\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;More Bad News For Working Families in Scott Walker&rsquo;s Broken Promises Budget,&quot;</u></a> March 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WisDems.org, <a href=\"http://wisdems.org/news/press/view/2014-10-fact-check-scott-walkers-trouble-with-the-truth-2\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Fact Check: Scott Walker&rsquo;s Trouble With The Truth,&quot;</u></a> Oct. 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2014/jan/23/top-10-most-fact-checked-people-truth-/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Top 10 most fact-checked people on the Truth-O-Meter,&quot;</u></a> Jan. 23, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "", "false_count": 7, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 841, "last_name": "Democratic Party of Wisconsin", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "state-democratic-party-wisconsin", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Dem-donkey.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/841/", "total_count": 25, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.wisdems.org/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Gov.
