Scott Walker on May 10, 2012 made a small deficit at the mid-point in his two-year budget -- poof -- disappear.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGone along with it: An issue Democrats were using against Walker in the June 5, 2012 recall election.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis was posted the following day on the <a href=\"http://www.scottwalker.org/blog/2012/05/budget-surplus-shows-reforms-making-giant-strides-towards-prosperity\">Walker campaign blog:</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Not only have we turned away from the failed policies that drove us to the brink of insolvency with chronic billion-dollar budget deficits, double-digit tax increases and record-setting job loss, but we have taken a complete 180 degree turn to true prosperity with a budget surplus that will help far into our future,&quot; the post read in part.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Walker&rsquo;s campaign <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/gop-leaders-challenge-barrett-t\">boasted the news was so good</a> extra funds will be socked away in budget-stabilization account: &quot;For the first time in state history, we have put millions of dollars into our rainy day fund in consecutive years.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHistory, or course, can be an awful long time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid back-to-back contributions happen thanks to Walker&rsquo;s policies?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin first created a <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wi.gov/statutes/statutes/16/III/518/3\">stabilization fund</a> in 1985, so it&rsquo;s actually a fairly new thing. But the state has seldom put money into it. That&rsquo;s one reason Wisconsin lives closer to the fiscal edge than many other states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the first deposit into the fund was in 2006-07, during the final term of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, Walker&rsquo;s predecessor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat deposit totalled $55.6 million, but was quickly used up in a budget crisis later in Doyle&rsquo;s term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second deposit made to the fund -- $14.8 million -- came at the end of &nbsp;Doyle&rsquo;s last budget, 2010-11. The deposit was made after Walker had taken office. His first six months overlapped the final six months of the Doyle budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat brings us to May 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s when Walker signalled that he could make another deposit, estimated at $45.4 million, after the fiscal year ends June 30, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, did Walker -- for the first time in state history &quot;put millions of dollars into our rainy day fund in consecutive years&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot exactly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, the deposit is a projection. It would make two budgets in a row for the first time if it happens. It looks likely that a deposit will be made, but it&rsquo;s premature to say it already happened.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecond, the numbers are not based on the &quot;official&quot; revenue estimates that come from the Fiscal Bureau, the neutral scorekeeper on budget items. That caused Democrats to howl in protest when Walker put out the well-timed news.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn February 2012, the Fiscal Bureau said that tax revenues were coming up short, leaving a small projected deficit by June 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe new Walker estimate is based on revenue forecasts compiled by Walker&rsquo;s Department of Administration for February, March and April. In a <a href=\"http://thewheelerreport.com/releases/May12/0510/0510doamemo.pdf\">May memo</a> to Walker, Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch described it as &quot;the potential&quot; for a $45.4 million deposit when the books close at the end of June 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile not official, the estimates are based on the same sources of data used by the Fiscal Bureau. Bureau Director Bob Lang told us he didn&rsquo;t verify Walker&rsquo;s numbers but said they don&rsquo;t appear unreasonable.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll know the size of the actual deposit, if there is one, when the state completes its annual financial report once accounts are settled, in late summer. It&rsquo;s also possible the deposit could exceed the projected $45.4 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWho deserves credit?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile 2011 was Doyle&rsquo;s final budget year, it was Walker who brought the budget back into balance with his budget-repair bill in early 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYou may recall that little old bill -- the one that included higher pension and health-insurance payments from state and local government employees, and curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLikewise, the expected 2012 surplus would clearly be on Walker&rsquo;s watch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it&rsquo;s arguable how much a governor has to do with rising tax collections. Walker&rsquo;s administration attributed the brighter tax-collection forecasts in large part to improved job-creation figures and personal income growth, which are subject to economic cycles. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAdditionally, putting money in the stabilization fund is not a matter of choice. By law, 50 percent of any surplus from higher-than-expected income and other tax collections must be transferred to the rainy day fund. That&rsquo;s exactly what Walker is saying he would deposit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I believe that both the Doyle deposit and pending Walker deposit were not done by volition or predetermined plan but by a state law requirement when excess funds appear,&quot; said Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we attribute budget deficits to elected officials, so they must also get some credit for surpluses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s took credit for what the campaign said was a historic double-up of surplus tax funds into a rainy day fund for stabilizing future state budgets. The chances for a second straight transfer into the fund appear good, but it&rsquo;s premature to say the money is in the bank.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker gets the bulk of the credit, but his campaign claim is just partially accurate, because it skips over the important fact that the deal&rsquo;s not done yet.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate it Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>(You can comment on this item on the<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/politifact-testing-walker-barrett-claims-on-the-states-fiscal-health-bn5k127-155928435.html\"> Journal Sentinel&#39;s website</a>) </em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-30T19:02:30.307923", "ruling_date": "2012-05-31T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Gov.
