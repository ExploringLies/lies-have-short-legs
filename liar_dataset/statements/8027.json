They show that women&rsquo;s pay lags men in nearly all professions that are measured. For example, women credit counselors and loan officers in 2012 earned 79.1 percent of men. Women accountants and auditors earned 73.8 percent of their male counterparts. Women computer programmers earned 84.2 percent of what men earned in that field.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut even those broad occupational categories don&rsquo;t provide an apples-to-apples comparison of people &quot;working the same job,&quot; said Karen Kosanovich, an economist with the BLS.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe BLS, she explained, can look at the weekly earnings of men and women in the general category of &quot;physicians and surgeons&quot; -- but that doesn&rsquo;t &nbsp;mean they&rsquo;re the same type of doctor. Within that broad category are general practitioners and cardiologists, department heads and physicians who have just started their careers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t&quot;We can&rsquo;t do same-job analysis,&quot; Kosanovich said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tA final note: Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for McAuliffe, said his boss got the information for his statement on gender gap pay discrimination from a web <a href=\"http://www.nationalpartnership.org/site/PageServer?pagename=issues_fairness_fairpay\">post</a> by the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families. That posting, however, does not say the census data compared the pay of men and women doing the same jobs.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBy saying women earn 77 percent of what men earn for &quot;working the same job,&quot; McAuliffe took a valid figure and blew it out of proportion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tContrary to McAuliffe&rsquo;s assertion, the 77-percent figure is not a comparison of the earnings of women doing the same jobs as men. It is a broad comparison of the median annual pay for men and women regardless of occupation.
