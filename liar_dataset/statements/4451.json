We began by turning to the bill itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe provision in question follows <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/26/business/help-wanted-ads-exclude-the-long-term-jobless.html\">news reports</a> that some companies have rejected unemployed job applicants out of hand as a way of filtering the large numbers of job resumes they&rsquo;re receiving. In some cases, companies even made it clear in advertisements that they would not consider applicants who were unemployed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince unemployment levels have remained stuck for months at near post-Great Depression highs, such practices posed a challenge for an administration that desperately wants to boost employment. So the bill states the overarching position that &quot;denial of employment opportunities to individuals because of their status as unemployed is discriminatory.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpecifically, the bill prohibits employers from publishing help-wanted ads that disqualify people who are unemployed, and bars employers from failing to consider or hire an individual &quot;because of the individual&#39;s status as unemployed.&quot; The bill places similar restrictions on employment agencies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for enforcement of the new provision, the bill says that &quot;a court of the United States shall have the same jurisdiction and powers as the court has to enforce ... Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964&quot; -- the landmark provision that bans employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn individual who seeks redress through the courts, the bill says, &quot;may be awarded, as appropriate&quot; an order to employers to stop the prohibited practices, &quot;reimbursement of costs expended as a result of the unlawful employment practice,&quot; damages up to $1,000 for each day of the violation, and &quot;reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLynne Bernabei, a Washington employment lawyer best known for representing whistleblowers, agreed that Hannity described the law accurately, though she said that individuals suing under the new provisions -- if they are ultimately enacted as written -- will still face a steep climb in the courts before they secure any compensation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Any individual suing under this law has to prove that he was discriminated against because he was unemployed,&quot; Bernabei said. &quot;Discrimination is always difficult to prove, and it wouldn&#39;t be any easier to prove in this context.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut Hannity didn&rsquo;t suggest that plaintiffs would somehow be assured of winning in court; he simply said that they would have the opportunity to sue. We rate Hannity&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-09-15T15:55:31.554120", "ruling_date": "2011-09-15T16:24:24", "ruling_headline": "Sean Hannity says Barack Obama's jobs bill creates new avenue for unemployed to sue for discrimination", "ruling_headline_slug": "sean-hannity-says-barack-obamas-jobs-bill-creates-", "ruling_link_text": "It's in the bill", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Sean Hannity, comments on Fox News&rsquo; <em>Hannity </em>show, Sept 13, 2011<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/reports/american-jobs-act.pdf\">Text</a> of President Barack Obama&rsquo;s proposed jobs bill<br />\r\n<br />\r\nE-mail interview with Lynne Bernabei, partner with the law firm Bernabei &amp; Wachtel, Sept. 14, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "Radio/TV host", "false_count": 7, "first_name": "Sean", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "", "id": 184, "last_name": "Hannity", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "sean-hannity", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Hannity.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/184/", "total_count": 26, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://www.hannity.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Under President Barack Obama&rsquo;s jobs bill, &quot;you can sue if you are unemployed and don&#39;t get the job and think you weren&#39;t hired because you are unemployed.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a discussion on Fox News' \"Hannity\"", "statement_date": "2011-09-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 104, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/104/", "subject": "Pundits", "subject_slug": "pundits", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 103, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/103/", "subject": "Workers", "subject_slug": "workers", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
