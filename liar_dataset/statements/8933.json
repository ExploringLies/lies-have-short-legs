The new version provides greater context for Mayor Dwight Jones&rsquo; statement, but does not change our original ruling of False. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mayor Dwight Jones opened his annual State of the City Address quoting from the popular travel guide Frommer&rsquo;s, which <a href=\"http://www.frommers.com/slideshows/847926-frommer-s-top-destinations-for-2014\"><u>touted </u></a>Richmond&rsquo;s outdoor offerings and craft beer scene as reasons it recommends the capital as a top travel destination this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What they&rsquo;re saying is something that we already know: That Richmond is a cool place to live, work and play,&quot; Jones said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later in the speech, Jones cited additional Richmond accolades, and one particularly caught our attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We are the most vegan-friendly city,&quot; he said, drawing chuckles from the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Has the old confederate capital become become the Mecca for people who abstain from all animal products? Lettuce take a look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tammy Hawley, the mayor&rsquo;s spokeswoman, pointed us to 2013 <a href=\"http://www.peta.org/features/top-vegan-friendly-cities-2013/\"><u>ratings</u></a> by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a group that promotes meat-free diets and opposes animal testing. PETA ranked U.S. cities based on &quot;availability of vegan options&quot; as well as the &quot;influence of vegan culture,&quot; said Lindsay Rahat, the group&rsquo;s associate director of campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Richmond won kudos for being &quot;packed with meat-free restaurants&quot; and hosting an annual <a href=\"http://www.veggiefest.org/\"><u>vegetarian festival</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But those accolades did not result in Richmond winning the vegan-friendly crown. In fact, Richmond was ranked 10th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top spot went to Austin, Texas, in the heart of cattle country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also ranked ahead of Richmond were Portland, Ore.; Los Angeles; New York; Chicago; Seattle; Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and Boulder, Colo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In trumpeting Richmond&rsquo;s other accolades, Jones accurately noted that various groups have included Virginia&rsquo;s capital in Top 10 lists of cities that are the best place to work and live, the most creative, the best place for jobs and have the best outdoors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in addition to botching Richmond&rsquo;s vegan standing, the mayor erred on two other ratings:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*He touted Richmond as the &quot;happiest city for young professionals&quot; based on a 2011 posting by Careerbliss, an online jobs site. Richmond was 15th on the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45ehmi/no-15-richmond-va/#gallerycontent\"><u>list</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*He said Richmond is the &quot;healthiest city for women,&quot; although it actually ranked 51st in a 2011 <a href=\"http://www.self.com/health/2011/12/100-healthiest-cities\"><u>survey</u></a> by Self Magazine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Our ruling</strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jones said Richmond is the &quot;most vegan friendly city.&quot; The source he cited, however, rated Richmond 10th in providing animal-free food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t doubt Jones&rsquo; contention that Richmond is &quot;cool.&quot; When it comes to vegans, Richmond may be hospitable, but it has not been rated the friendliest city for them. So we rate the mayor&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-02-14T18:20:29.084263", "ruling_date": "2014-02-14T18:18:05", "ruling_headline": "Mayor Jones says Richmond is rated \"the most vegan-friendly city\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "mayor-jones-says-richmond-rated-most-vegan-friendl", "ruling_link_text": "No meat here", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Mayor Dwight Jones, State of the City <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksfbVFqPV0c\"><u>speech</u></a>, Jan. 30, 2014.
