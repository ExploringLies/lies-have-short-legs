During the announcement, Brady compared the United States tax code to other countries&rsquo; and made one notable claim about United States exporters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No longer will we be the only major country that taxes its own exports,&quot; Brady said. He wrote something similar in a<em> Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-gop-plan-for-tax-sanity-1466740802\">editorial</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This caught our eye, given a <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html\">clause </a>in the Constitution &mdash; Article I, Section 9 &mdash; &nbsp;stating &quot;No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what was Brady referring to? A spokesperson for Brady referred us to the GOP&rsquo;s &quot;Our Better Way&quot; <a href=\"http://abetterway.speaker.gov/_assets/pdf/ABetterWay-Tax-PolicyPaper.pdf\">tax plan</a>. So we dug in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Our Better Way&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plan points to one aspect of the current tax code: the use of a federal corporate income tax rather than a federal consumption tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s explain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many countries beside the United States use a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/03/how-does-a-value-added-tax-work-anyway/36834/\">value-added</a>&quot; consumption tax in addition to an income tax. The VAT is complicated to explain, but in essence applies taxes throughout the production chain and not just at the end like a normal sales tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One aspect of the VAT is &quot;border adjustability,&quot; which means the country removes the &quot;value-added&quot; tax when it&rsquo;s applied to exports, said Richard Schmalbeck, a professor of law at Duke University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;VATs are consumption taxes, and it wouldn&#39;t be appropriate for the French to tax consumption by residents of other countries,&quot; Schmalbeck said. &quot;The border adjustments assure that the tax will be borne only by French consumers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Point being, other countries&rsquo; national consumption taxes (which the United States&nbsp;does not have) do not tax exports. But Brady is missing something in his comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Income taxes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other countries&rsquo; income taxes do capture exports under their umbrella, experts told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the income from exported goods is still made from domestic manufacturing, said H. David Rosenbloom, a professor of taxation at New York University, who called Brady&rsquo;s claim &quot;incomplete.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When BMW manufactures an automobile in Germany, I would doubt very much that the income attributable to the manufacturing activity is exempt from German income taxation,&quot; Rosenbloom said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exempting foreign export sales from income tax is also not an easy task, said Peter Barnes, a senior lecturing fellow at Duke University. Companies would have to keep separate books on domestic and foreign sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added that some countries in the past, China and India notably, have done this. However, such exemptions are not standard practice, Barnes said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, agreed. He said other countries&rsquo; income taxes would impose some burden on exports, even if exports are exempted from their consumption taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The &lsquo;territorial&rsquo; corporate income taxes that most countries have are still origin-based taxes (i.e., not border adjusted),&quot; Rosenberg said. &quot;The base is essentially domestic production and those taxes apply to domestically produced goods whether they are sold at home or abroad.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A new system</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among other measures designed to promote international competitiveness, the GOP plan wants to transform the United States&rsquo; current corporate income tax system, which currently lacks border adjustments, into what is called a &quot;destination, cash-flow based&quot; income tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This <a href=\"http://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1033&amp;context=lawreview\">new system</a> would tax net cash flow, deduct exported sales and impose the income tax on imports. Thus, the new tax protocol provides for income taxes on the &quot;border adjustments&quot; other countries use for VAT consumption taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To deduct exports, companies would subtract sales abroad from revenue otherwise taxed, Rosenberg said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Rosenberg and other economists are also <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/publication/border-tax-adjustments-wont-stimulate-exports/\">not sold</a> on how problematic the current state of affairs actually is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Most economists would not expect any significant change in the terms of trade from this tax swap,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barnes also suggested that the new tax system could compel other countries to move to a destination-based system, hurting U.S. businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Imagine if Boeing owed income tax to every country where it sold a plane,&quot; Barnes said. &quot;Or Apple.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also unclear that border adjustments under the new approach would be allowed by current international tax law, Rosenberg said. Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, also <a href=\"https://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/2016/06/25/a-remarkably-good-and-reasonably-bold-tax-reform-plan-from-house-republicans/\">wrote</a> the World Trade Organization might not approve this new plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A few exceptions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you believe Brady broadly has something of a point comparing the U.S. system to VAT countries, he&rsquo;s wrong on the specifics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other countries do apply a direct export tax on goods. Most of these are in developing countries and are imposed only on select agricultural goods, according to a WTO <a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/discussion_papers4_e.pdf\">report</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a few <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?doclanguage=en&amp;cote=td/tc/wp(2002)54/final\">countries</a> that impose export taxes are countries belonging to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (a typical benchmark for a major country). Norway, Turkey and Mexico have export taxes for a few select goods. Brazil has an export tax on all goods, up to 30 percent, although officials say these taxes are typically not applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brady said that the United States is the only country that taxes its own exports, a problem the GOP tax plan intends to fix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other countries do exempt exports from their consumption taxes using &quot;border-adjustments.&quot; However, experts told us that Brady&rsquo;s statement ignores the income taxes of other countries, which do end up taxing export income, at least in part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For that reason, we rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/232eaee9-6d5f-4e86-863e-162ba667e2af\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/232eaee9-6d5f-4e86-863e-162ba667e2af</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-28T10:46:36.840580", "ruling_date": "2016-06-28T11:30:41", "ruling_headline": "Texas Republican Kevin Brady errs in comparison of U.S. tax code", "ruling_headline_slug": "texas-republican-kevin-brady-errs-comparison-us-ta", "ruling_link_text": "Multiple types of taxes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Committee on Ways and Means, &quot;House Republicans <a href=\"http://waysandmeans.house.gov/house-republicans-unveil-21st-century-tax-plan-built-growth/\">Unveil </a>21st Century Tax Plan Built for Growth,&quot; June 24, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-gop-plan-for-tax-sanity-1466740802\">The Wall Street Journal</a>, &quot;The GOP Plan for Tax Sanity,&quot; June 24, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Archives and Records Administration, &quot;The <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html\">Constitution</a> of the United States: A Transcription.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42780.pdf\">Congressional Research Service</a>, &quot;Export Clause: Limitation on Congress&rsquo;s Taxing Power,&quot; October 18, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaker of the House, &quot;<a href=\"http://abetterway.speaker.gov/_assets/pdf/ABetterWay-Tax-PolicyPaper.pdf\">A Better Way</a>, Our Vision For A Confident America: Tax&quot; June 24, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/discussion_papers4_e.pdf\">World Trade Organization</a>, &quot;The Role of Export Taxes in the Field of Primary Commodities,&quot; 2004</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OECD, <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=917\">Glossary</a> of Statistical Terms: Export Taxes,&quot; November 11, 2001</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/03/how-does-a-value-added-tax-work-anyway/36834/\">The Atlantic</a>, &quot;How does a &lsquo;Value Added Tax&rsquo; Work, Anyway?&quot; March 1, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aei.org/publication/border-tax-adjustments-wont-stimulate-exports/\">American Enterprise Institute</a>, &quot;Border Tax Adjustments Won&rsquo;t Stimulate Exports,&quot; March 2, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://danieljmitchell.wordpress.com/2016/06/25/a-remarkably-good-and-reasonably-bold-tax-reform-plan-from-house-republicans/\">International Liberty</a>, &quot;A Remarkably Good and Reasonably Bold Tax Reform Plan From Republicans,&quot; June 25, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.taxanalysts.com/www/freefiles.nsf/Files/SLEMROD-14.pdf/$file/SLEMROD-14.pdf\">Tax Analysts</a>, &quot;Does a VAT Promote Exports?&quot; 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working Party of the Trade Committee, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?doclanguage=en&amp;cote=td/tc/wp(2002)54/final\">Analysis</a> of Non-Tariff Measures: The Case of Export Duties,&quot; January 31, 2003</p>\r\n\r\n<p>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.wto.org/gatt_docs/English/SULPDF/90840088.pdf\">Report</a> by the Working Party on Border Tax Adjustments,&quot; November 20, 1970</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/global-perspective-territorial-taxation\">Tax Foundation</a>, &quot;A Global Perspective on Territorial Taxation,&quot; August 10, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Catholic University <a href=\"http://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1033&amp;context=lawreview\">Law Review,</a> &quot;A Common Sense Corporate Tax: The Case for a Destination-Based, Cash Flow Tax on Corporations,&quot; 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Richard Schmalbeck, Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett professor of law at Duke University, June 27, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email and phone interview with H.
