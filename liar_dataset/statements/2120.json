He has made his fight against financial businesses&mdash;or &quot;holding Wall Street accountable&quot; in his words &mdash; a central theme of his 2010 campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Cordray&rsquo;s campaign website, the Democrat trumpets the &quot;major cases&quot; against &quot;the big Wall Street banks and financial institutions&quot; that have &quot;caused widespread financial damage to Ohioans.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCordray&rsquo;s most eye-popping claim of reining in fat cat financiers is that &quot;his office has already recovered over $2 billion from Wall Street for the workers, retirees, and investors who were harmed.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a mountain of money &mdash; and the kind of thing we at PolitiFact like to check out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCordray reaches his &quot;recovered over $2 billion&quot; figure by totaling the settlements relating to lawsuits against UnitedHealth ($922 million), Merrill Lynch ($475 million), Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. ($400 million) and secondary defendants in a case against AIG ($284.5 million). Do the math and you get a tad over $2 billion &mdash; $2,081,500,000 if you want to get specific. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause Cordray has only been in office since January 2009, his claim to have &quot;recovered&quot; $97.5 million from accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the secondary defendants in the AIG case, is on the shakiest ground. That&rsquo;s because the settlement was reached on Oct. 3, 2008, when the Ohio Attorney General was Nancy Rogers. <a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Briefing-Room/Litigation-Pages/Securities-Litigation-Briefing-Documents/97-Million-partial-settlement-reached-in-AIG-secur\">She even sent out a news release</a> praising the settlement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCordray&rsquo;s campaign argues that it still should count because the primary case against AIG was still being litigated -- his office on July 16 announced a final, $725 million settlement in the case -- and there is a contested appeal that could affect the PricewaterhouseCoopers settlement. Frankly, we aren&rsquo;t convinced, and drop Cordray&rsquo;s total from just above $2 billion to just below $2 billion for adding in that settlement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, that isn&rsquo;t the only quibble we have with Corday&rsquo;s $2 billion figure. A more basic question is what exactly does &quot;Wall Street&quot; mean?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe thought of traders on the crowded floors of stock exchanges and the famous statue of the Merrill Lynch bull in lower Manhattan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCordray&rsquo;s campaign says they used a broad definition that includes &quot;any publicly traded companies that negatively affected the value of their stock&quot; and harmed Ohio workers, retirees and investors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat somewhat elastic definition can be stretched so that Wall Street includes UnitedHealth, a health care giant whose main corporate offices are in Minneapolis &mdash; a 20-hour drive from New York&rsquo;s Wall Street financial district.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe think that a reasonable person would find that more than a bit of stretch to say that a health care company based more than 1,200 miles from Manhattan is a &quot;Wall Street&quot; company. Put another way: What would you say to a friend who claimed to work on Wall Street, if they were employed by United Health in Minneapolis?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeyond just the location and United Health&rsquo;s industry, Cordray&rsquo;s use of the $922 million settlement for UnitedHealth has another issue &mdash; the $922 million isn&rsquo;t money that United Health executives forked over to the state of Ohio. Instead, it&rsquo;s $804 million worth of improperly granted stock options to corporate executives at United Health Care that were canceled as part of the settlement, as well as $126 million from pulled back cash bonuses, retirement packages and health care packages for the executives. (We know that adds up to $930 million, but for whatever reason Cordray has used a $922 million figure for this settlement.) &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile Cordray&rsquo;s campaign says that&rsquo;s money being returned back into the company&rsquo;s bottom line, Washington and Lee Professor Lymon Johnson, a nationally recognized expert in stock options and corporate law, said that&rsquo;s not exactly the case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;By canceling out those stock options, you are stopping them (the executives) from taking greater advantage of the company, but that&rsquo;s not the same thing as money going back into the corporate till,&quot; Johnson said. However, he does say that if the stock options were exercised by the United Health executives that it would have affected the company&rsquo;s stock price by &quot;diluting&quot; the value of the stock held by others.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, Johnson asserts, &quot;I don&rsquo;t know that I would use the term recover.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Recovery suggests that the thief got away and that you chased him down and got what he stole back,&quot; he said. &quot;In this case, it&rsquo;s more like you prevented it from happening&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t really get away with the theft.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause Cordray is taking credit for a $97.5 million settlement done by his predecessor and because $804 million worth of canceled stock options from a Minneapolis-based health care company account for almost half of his &quot;over $2 billion recovered&quot; from &quot;Wall Street,&quot; we find his claim to be Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/07/wall_street_businesses_have_re.html\">Comment on this item</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-25T18:41:35.447280", "ruling_date": "2010-07-26T07:15:00", "ruling_headline": "Wall Street businesses have returned money to Ohio, but Richard Cordray overstates the total", "ruling_headline_slug": "wall-street-businesses-have-returned-money-ohio-ri", "ruling_link_text": "He still has bragging rights on about $1 billion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/AnnualReport2009\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.19704147044040732\">Ohio Attorney General&rsquo;s 2009 Annual Report</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail correspondence with Adam Herman, campaign spokesman for Richard Cordray.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone interview with Lyman Johnson, 07-14-2010&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Richard", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 531, "last_name": "Cordray", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "richard-cordray", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifactohio-richard-cordray___.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/531/", "total_count": 7, "true_count": 1, "website": "https://cordrayforohio.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays his office &quot;has already recovered over $2 billion from Wall Street for the workers, retirees, and investors who were harmed.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a statement posted to his website", "statement_date": "2010-07-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 131, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/131/", "subject": "Government Efficiency", "subject_slug": "government-efficiency", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
