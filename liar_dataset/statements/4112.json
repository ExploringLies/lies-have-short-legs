Eddie Rodriguez said outnumbered Democrats tried to illuminate tax loopholes and exemptions that, if closed, would yield badly needed state revenue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Austin Democrat told the Central Texas Democratic Forum on June 22: &quot;You all would be very, very surprised to know what we exempt in the state of Texas.&quot; For example, he said, &quot;jet fuel is exempt. We are the only state, I think, that exempts that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor real?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRodriguez&rsquo;s chief of staff, Nate Walker, later said Rodriguez was referring to the fact Texas does not levy a motor fuels tax on jet fuel. Indeed, R.J. DeSilva, spokesman for the state comptroller&rsquo;s office, pointed us to <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/SOTWDocs/TX/htm/TX.162.htm\">sections</a> of the motor fuels tax code that exempt all gas for aircraft delivered into or sold from a storage facility of a licensed aviation fuel dealer from the state&rsquo;s gas or motor fuels tax. A February <a href=\"http://www.window.state.tx.us/taxinfo/incidence/96-463TaxIncidence02-11.pdf\">report</a>&nbsp; by State Comptroller Susan Combs pegs the value of the gas tax exemption for aviation at $4.5 million for the fiscal year that ends Aug. 31. DeSilva said the value of the exemption for diesel fuel used in airplanes is not calculated.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDeSilva said he didn&rsquo;t know if Texas is the only state with such provisions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tResearching that aspect, we turned to the Washington-based Federation of Tax Administrators, which guided us to the Maryland-based Airline Owners and Pilots Association, which pointed us to a Phoenix expert on aviation costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNel Stubbs of Conklin &amp; de Decker, which <a href=\"http://www.conklindd.com/Page.aspx?nid=5\">describes itself</a> as enabling customers to make more informed decisions when dealing with the purchase and operation of aircraft, told us by email that Texas and three other states &mdash; Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island &mdash; exempt jet fuel from their respective motor fuels taxes. Other states, she said, refund some or all of an airline&rsquo;s motor fuels&rsquo; tax payments. Stubbs defined jet fuel as a type of aviation fuel designed for aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRodriguez&rsquo;s office, which we alerted to Stubbs&rsquo; analysis, passed along a 2008 <a href=\"http://www.commissions.leg.state.mn.us/afwg/Finalreport.pdf\">report</a> by Stubbs illuminating variations in jet-fuel taxation. California, for instance, levies a jet-fuel tax of two cents per gallon, though airlines are exempt. Similarly, commercial aircraft may qualify for partial exemptions from Florida&rsquo;s tax of 6.9 cents per gallon, according to the report, while airlines fueling in New York are entitled to refunds of their payments of 6.5 cents a gallon.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStubbs, saying she&rsquo;s tracked state-by-state differences since the late 1980s, added in an interview: &quot;We&rsquo;re 50 little kingdoms out there. You can never say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re the only state that does this,&rsquo; because you&rsquo;d be wrong. You can never say, &lsquo;All states do something (either).&rsquo; They&rsquo;re all different.&quot; Finally, she forwarded a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1huQHC_jQU72htp8m2TsdA7mfk76RSCmG-LfOY3Z2ECU/http%3A%2F%2Falt.coxnewsweb.com%2Fstatesman%2Fpolitifact%2F07122011_conklinddstatetaxsummary.pdf\">chart </a>showing variations in tax methods showing too that 11 states charge a sales tax, yet no motor fuels tax, on jet fuel.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe circled back to Rodriguez, who said he had assumed Texas was the only state that doesn&rsquo;t levy the motor fuels tax on jet fuel because the exemption struck him as weird. Besides, he reminded, Texas still is one of the few states with the exemption.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-14T15:40:59.366925", "ruling_date": "2011-07-15T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Eddie Rodriguez says Texas is the only state that exempts jet fuel from tax", "ruling_headline_slug": "eddie-rodriguez-says-texas-only-state-exempts-jet-", "ruling_link_text": "Overlooks three states--that might could fit in a Texas county", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tConklin &amp; de Decker, report, <a href=\"http://www.commissions.leg.state.mn.us/afwg/Finalreport.pdf\">&quot;STATE TAXES ON AIRCRAFT,&quot;</a> and chart, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/07122011_conklinddstatetaxsummary.pdf\">&quot;State Tax Summary,&quot;</a> Dec. 1, 2008 and July 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/07112011_nelstubbsresponsepftexas.html\">Email</a> and telephone interview, Nel Stubbs, vice president/co-owner, Conklin &amp; de Decker, Phoenix, July 11 and 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Eddie Rodriguez, state representative, July 13, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Texas House Representative", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Eddie", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 1085, "last_name": "Rodriguez", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "eddie-rodriguez", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/eddie.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1085/", "total_count": 4, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.house.state.tx.us/members/member-page/?district=51"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Texas is the only state that exempts jet fuel from its state motor fuels tax.</p>", "statement_context": "a forum.", "statement_date": "2011-06-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 208, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/208/", "subject": "State Finances", "subject_slug": "state-finances", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
