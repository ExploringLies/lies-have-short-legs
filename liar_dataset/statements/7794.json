Tom Price of Georgia has some specific concerns about President Barack Obama&rsquo;s proposed budget.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tA post on the Roswell Republican&rsquo;s Twitter page summarized his objections.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\t&quot;POTUS&rsquo; budget adds 2 new tax increases to IRA &amp; 401(k) savers. A total tax increase of $14billion. #ObamaTaxHike,&quot; it read.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tPOTUS is an acronym for president of the United States.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tA PolitiFact Georgia Twitter follower was skeptical about whether Price had his facts right and asked us to investigate.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tPrice spokesman Ryan Murphy explained the congressman&rsquo;s claim. Price was referring to two changes in the proposed budget. The first would require some beneficiaries of individual retirement accounts to take their inherited distributions over a five-year stretch. The second change would limit the accrual of tax-favored retirement plans. It would cap how much money people could accumulate in tax-deferred retirement accounts at $3.4 million. </p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\t&quot;The total revenue impact comes to $14.253 billion over ten years,&quot; Murphy said via email. </p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tA White House report Murphy forwarded us detailed Murphy&rsquo;s claim. The report includes both proposed changes that Murphy mentioned. It also contains a table that says changing the rules for beneficiaries would bring in an additional $4.9 billion in revenue to the federal government over 10 years. By creating the cap, the chart shows the federal government would pocket an additional $9.3 billion over 10 years. Together, it&rsquo;s slightly more than $14 billion, as Murphy said.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tThe White House communications department asked us to send our questions in writing. We did so twice and did not get a response.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tGrover Norquist, the outspoken leader of Americans for Tax Reform, wrote about these proposed changes in a list of the top 10 tax increases in Obama&rsquo;s budget.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tSome experts say the percentage of Americans who would be affected by these changes is small. Less than 1 percent of IRA and 401(k) account holders have more than $3 million in their portfolios, one study shows.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tEric Toder, an expert at the Tax Policy Center in Washington, agreed these changes would affect a small number of Americans. Toder said by limiting the beneficiary withdrawals to just five years, &quot;you are going to be paying more taxes.&quot; Tax experts say the five-year requirement makes recipients withdraw a larger sum of money, but it could also put that person into a higher tax bracket and make him pay more in income taxes.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tCurrently, there&rsquo;s no limit on how much you can accumulate in a retirement account. If approved, investors would have to put more money in taxable accounts once they exceed the limit, Forbes.com says.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tToder said there&rsquo;s been some discussion on Capitol Hill about limiting the accrual, but he doesn&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much interest in Congress to make either one of these changes.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tStill, is it accurate to label these as tax increases since they&rsquo;re not typical changes in a tax rate? Toder compared it to changing the mortgage interest deduction on income taxes, an idea that was discussed during last year&rsquo;s presidential race. For homeowners, he said, such a change would be a tax increase.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\t&quot;Technically, they are tax increases,&quot; he said of the proposed changes.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tWilliam McBride, the chief economist at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation in Washington, agreed with Price&rsquo;s assessment.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\t&quot;Yes, these count as increases,&quot; McBride said via email.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tTo sum up, Price claimed on Twitter that the president&rsquo;s budget includes two new tax increases that would total $14 billion. The changes could add that much money to Uncle Sam&rsquo;s coffers over a 10-year period. </p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tCalling them tax increases is a matter of semantics. That could imply it would affect large numbers of people who got Price&rsquo;s tweet. The changes would affect a very small percentage of account holders, studies show. That&rsquo;s important context that is missing. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate Price&rsquo;s claim Mostly True. </p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-05-16T21:50:22.653580", "ruling_date": "2013-05-17T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Price takes Obama to task for budget proposals", "ruling_headline_slug": "price-takes-obama-task-budget-proposals", "ruling_link_text": "Price pretty much right", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-1f5fe285-b02a-0738-3885-ce3c5ad2663f\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\tTwitter post by U.S. Rep.
