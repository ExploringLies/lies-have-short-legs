Martin O&rsquo;Malley said yes during the first Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Secretary Clinton&#39;s campaign put out a lot of reversals on positions on Keystone and many other things,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You know, we know that if you are learning, you&#39;re going to change your position,&quot; Clinton said in response. &quot;I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to look at Clinton&rsquo;s comments, which drew the ire of some critics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They pointed to something Clinton said in 2010. Then, she said the administration was &quot;inclined&quot; to approve the pipeline extension. But isolating that single word leaves out a good bit of context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry heavy crude oil mixture from Western Canada to the United States, has long been on hold pending a review by President Barack Obama and the State Department. The administration must first determine if the pipeline &quot;serves the national interest&quot; because it crosses an international border. Chief opposition to the project comes from environmental groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout her campaign in 2015, Clinton <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/22/politics/hillary-clinton-keystone-pipeline-history/\">has avoided</a> taking a position on the pipeline -- until she announced in September that she opposes it. Prior to that, Clinton&rsquo;s last substantial comment on her Keystone position was in 2010 when she was secretary of state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking on Oct. 15, 2010, with the Commonwealth Club, a public forum in California, <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2010/10/149542.htm\">Clinton took a question</a> asking if the administration would be willing to &quot;reconsider&quot; the pipeline. Here&rsquo;s Clinton&rsquo;s response:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;Well, there hasn&#39;t been a final decision made. (Crosstalk) Probably not. And we -- but we haven&#39;t finished all of the analysis. So as I say, we&#39;ve not yet signed off on it. But we are inclined to do so, and we are for several reasons -- going back to one of your original questions -- we&#39;re either going to be dependent on dirty oil from the Gulf or dirty oil from Canada. And until we can get our act together as a country and figure out that clean, renewable energy is in both our economic interests and the interests of our planet -- (applause) -- I mean, I don&#39;t think it will come as a surprise to anyone how deeply disappointed the president and I are about our inability to get the kind of legislation through the Senate that the United States was seeking.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of days later in 2010, a State Department spokesman said, &quot;her words obviously stand,&quot; and &quot;her response reflected the status of the Keystone XL pipeline.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So yes, Clinton indicated that the administration at the time was &quot;inclined&quot; to sign off on the pipeline. But she did say multiple times that the analysis was not complete -- leaving open the possibility that the administration could backtrack if negative information were to come forward. The answer was positive toward the pipeline&rsquo;s prospects, but she did not in any way say she supported it unequivocally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2011/08/169568.htm\">In a 2011 news conference</a> with the Canadian foreign minister, Clinton answered a couple questions about the administration&rsquo;s preliminary Keystone XL review. But she did not indicate her position beyond vague comments such as, &quot;We are leaving no stone unturned in this process.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2010, she said the administration was &quot;inclined&quot; to back it, but she qualified that statement by noting that the analysis was not complete, and the administration had not taken a final position. While this shows a more&nbsp;positive attitude toward Keystone XL than Clinton&rsquo;s position today, it was not a firm stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than that one comment, Clinton did not indicate her position&nbsp;on Keystone until she announced that she opposed&nbsp;it in September 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Clinton&#39;s position a No Flip.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-14T10:12:00.221291", "ruling_date": "2015-10-14T10:50:30", "ruling_headline": "Clinton says her Keystone XL position isn't a flip-flop", "ruling_headline_slug": "clinton-says-her-keystone-xl-position-isnt-flip-fl", "ruling_link_text": "Keeping consistent on Keystone", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/the-oct-13-democratic-debate-who-said-what-and-what-it-means/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Debate transcript</u></a>, Oct. 13, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nexis archive search, Oct. 13, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/22/politics/hillary-clinton-keystone-pipeline-history/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hillary Clinton&#39;s 5 takes on the Keystone Pipeline,</u></a>&quot; Sept. 22, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-keystone-pipeline-opposes-213941\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hillary&#39;s Keystone pivot draws greens&#39; cheers,</u></a>&quot; Sept. 22, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Department, <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2010/10/149542.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Remarks on Innovation and American Leadership to the Commonwealth Club</u></a>, Oct. 15, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Department, <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2011/08/169568.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Remarks With Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird After Their Meeting,</u></a> Aug. 4, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>On the Keystone XL pipeline</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "in the first Democratic debate", "statement_date": "2015-10-13", "statement_type": {"id": 4, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/4/", "statement_type": "Flip", "type_description": "Flip-o-Meter items"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 5, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/5/", "subject": "Environment", "subject_slug": "environment", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
