Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wasn&rsquo;t impressed with the state of the American labor market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Feb. 8, 2015, edition of CNN&rsquo;s <em>State of the Union</em>, host Dana Bash asked Cruz whether he would run for president. He responded:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think we&#39;re facing enormous challenges in this country. The Obama economy has led to the lowest labor force participation since 1978. Ninety-two million Americans aren&#39;t working. Obamacare is a train wreck. We&#39;re seeing our constitutional rights under assault. And abroad the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy is an unmitigated disaster. Leading from behind doesn&#39;t work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve previously checked a claim by Cruz that &quot;we&rsquo;ve got the lowest labor force participation in over three decades, since 1978.&quot; We rated that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/26/ted-cruz/labor-force-participation-its-lowest-point-1978-sa/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mostly True</u></a> at the time, and it&rsquo;s still an accurate claim today. But we wondered whether Cruz was right that &quot;92 million Americans aren&#39;t working.&quot; So we took a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one sense, Cruz&rsquo;s estimate is actually too low. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 249.7 million non-institutionalized civilians 16 years of age and older last month. Of those, 148.2 million were employed, leaving 101.7 million not employed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But neither Cruz&rsquo;s 92 million figure nor the actual 101.7 million figure is especially meaningful -- because they lump in both the young and the old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the 101.7 million people who are not employed, 37.5 million are age 65 and over -- an age when Medicare kicks in and many Americans head into retirement. Another 11.9 million are between 16 and 19, meaning they&rsquo;re either high-school-age or starting college. And another 8 million are age 20 to 24, when many are in college or graduate school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Combined, these groups account for 57.5 million Americans -- or more than three-fifths of the number Cruz cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could one quibble with our calculation? Sure -- one could exclude the 20&nbsp;to&nbsp;24 category since not everyone that age is college-bound. And improving senior health means that Americans can effectively work past 65.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, we don&rsquo;t see much justification for Cruz counting high-school-age kids (roughly 10 million) and Americans 75 and up (17.6 million). Even this far more restrictive definition leaves almost one-third of Cruz&rsquo;s number questionable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another point worth noting: Just because someone in the prime working-age range (25 to 64) isn&rsquo;t working doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are unemployed. They may be disabled, taking care of children full-time or have gone back to school. The actual number of officially unemployed Americans in January was a little under 9 million -- just one-tenth of the figure Cruz cited as &quot;not working.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz said that &quot;92 million Americans aren&#39;t working.&quot; Once you strip out senior citizens and school-age Americans, the number is less than half that. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>UPDATED, Feb. 11, 2015</em></strong><em>: After this fact-check was published, Cruz&rsquo;s office got back to PolitiFact with sourcing for the statistic. The statistic, they said, came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- </em><em><a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Table A-1</a>, for the total civilian, non-institutionalized population not in labor force, seasonally adjusted, for January 2015. The total for that month was 92.5 million. Spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said that Cruz was &quot;relying on objective federal labor statistics&quot; in making his statement. However, our fact-check didn&rsquo;t question the veracity of the BLS statistics &ndash; only their relevance to Cruz&rsquo;s point. We continue to believe the statistic includes Americans too young and too old to be expected to work, and we stand by our rating of Mostly False.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-02-09T10:42:38.414023", "ruling_date": "2015-02-10T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ted Cruz says 92 million Americans aren't working", "ruling_headline_slug": "ted-cruz-says-92-million-americans-arent-working", "ruling_link_text": "If you include high schoolers, senior citizens....", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Ted Cruz, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4620361?4\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview</u></a> on CNN&rsquo;s State of the Union, Feb. 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, &quot;Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey&quot; (main index page), accessed Feb. 9, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Tara Sinclair, economist at George Washington University, Feb. 9, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 43, "current_job": "Senator", "false_count": 38, "first_name": "Ted", "half_true_count": 20, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 1475, "last_name": "Cruz", "mostly_true_count": 22, "name_slug": "ted-cruz", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/CRUZPFTNEW.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1475/", "total_count": 141, "true_count": 7, "website": "http://www.tedcruz.org/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;92 million Americans aren&#39;t working.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\"", "statement_date": "2015-02-08", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
