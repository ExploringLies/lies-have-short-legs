David Cicilline, issued a news release Sept. 26 claiming that Cicilline is getting most of his money from large political action committees, not the individual donors that mark a grass-roots campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&#39;s the statement: &quot;The Doherty Campaign, unlike the Cicilline Campaign, is funded mostly by individual donors -- not the big PACs that Cicilline relies on.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo us, &quot;mostly&quot; means Cicilline is getting the majority -- more than half -- of his campaign funds from PACs. Because incumbents wield a lot of influence, especially members of Congress, it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if Cicilline was getting a lot of money from PACs, many of which are created by groups with specific agendas, such as businesses and labor unions. &nbsp;But we decided to check.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur quick go-to source for campaign finance information is <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/about/index.php\">OpenSecrets.org</a>, the nonpartisan &nbsp;nonprofit website of the Center for Responsive Politics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIts latest <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary.php?id=RI01&amp;cycle=2012\">tally for the Cicilline-Doherty race</a> shows that as of Aug. 22, 2012, Cicilline had received $413,806 in PAC contributions versus $109,250 in PAC money raised by Doherty.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat represents 24 percent of the money raised by Cicilline and 10 percent raised by Doherty.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s not a majority for either campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, most of Cicilline&#39;s money -- 68 percent -- has come from large contributions (classified as donations of more than $200) from individual donors. An identical percentage -- 68 percent -- of Doherty&#39;s campaign funds also comes from large individual donations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you add in the smaller contributions from individuals, Cicilline got 75 percent of his money from individuals compared to 86 percent for Doherty.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe e-mailed the Doherty campaign Sept. 27 asking if they were using a different source for its claim. Spokesman Dave Layman focused on the OpenSecrets data we were looking at.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The point we were trying to make is that Mr. Doherty has a larger percentage of individual contributions and relies far less on PAC money,&quot; he said in an e-mail.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Perhaps, we should have said: &#39;Both campaigns rely mostly on individual contributions, but about a quarter of Mr. Cicilline&rsquo;s campaign contributions ($413,806) come from PACs, whereas just 10% of Mr. Doherty&rsquo;s campaign contributions ($109,250) come from PACs.&#39; &nbsp;We should have made that clearer,&quot; Layman wrote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrendan Doherty said his campaign, &quot;unlike the Cicilline Campaign, is funded mostly by individual donors -- not the big PACs that Cicilline relies on.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCampaign finance data show that both campaigns are funded mostly by individual donors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCicilline may have gotten more money from political action committees than Doherty has, but the scope -- 24 percent of $1.7 million raised -- doesn&#39;t even come close to supporting a statement suggesting that Cicilline is getting most of his funds from PACs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Doherty&#39;s claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">False</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\">@politifactri</a>.
