Paul Ryan, R-Wis., as his running mate. They also were asked to comment about a recent shooting <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/13/justice/texas-am-shooting/index.html\">near Texas A&amp;M University.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth Perry and Scott cautioned about using the shooting as evidence that people&rsquo;s gun rights should be restricted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott then stated an amazing statistic about guns, if true.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I mean, I think we have more concealed weapons permits than any other state because Floridians care about their right to bear arms.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida is the fourth-most populous state in the country, so it&rsquo;s no surprise it would be high on a concealed permit list. But is it No. 1 ahead of Perry&rsquo;s Texas, which has 6 million more residents, and California, which is nearly double the size?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTurns out, yes. Scott is correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, recently studied the number of active concealed weapons permits by state. Their report, <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/600/592552.pdf\">available here</a>, is dated July 2012 and includes concealed weapons permit data as of Dec. 31, 2011, in most cases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe top 10 of valid permits by state breaks down like this:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t1. Florida -- 887,000;<br />\r\n\t2. Pennsylvania -- 786,000;<br />\r\n\t3. Georgia -- 600,000;<br />\r\n\t4. Texas -- 519,000;<br />\r\n\t5. Indiana -- 406,000;<br />\r\n\t6. Washington -- 351,000;<br />\r\n\t7. Utah -- 347,000;<br />\r\n\t8. Tennessee -- 341,000;<br />\r\n\t9. Michigan -- 296,000;<br />\r\n\t10. Virginia -- 279,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s two caveats to this list. First, several states, including Florida, allow out-of-state residents to acquire concealed weapons permits. So people living outside of Florida may have a Florida permit. Records don&rsquo;t distinguish by location.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecond, it&rsquo;s worth noting that many states have reciprocity agreements regarding concealed weapons permits, meaning that a Texas license is valid in Florida and vice versa.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe don&rsquo;t think either is enough to question the validity of Scott&rsquo;s remark, however.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThree large states are missing from the Top 10 list. Illinois does not issue concealed weapons permits. California and New York are considered a &quot;may issue&quot; states, which gives those states much more discretion over who gets a permit. That in turn makes it harder to get one.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs a result, California has just 35,000 active permits, representing .1 percent of the adult active population, according to the analysis. Florida, a &quot;shall issue&quot; state, had a concealed weapons permit rate of 6.2 percent of its active adult population. Georgia ranks first at 11 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott said Florida has &quot;more concealed weapons permits than any other state.&quot; A recent U.S. Government Accountability Office study backs Scott up. The state has about 887,000 valid concealed weapons permits, nearly 100,000 more than the next closest state, Pennsylvania.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this statement True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>(Correction: Our concluding graphs originally gave Georgia the No. 2 ranking and ignored Pennsylvania, which is rightly No. 2.)</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-14T17:55:12.075203", "ruling_date": "2012-08-14T18:36:34", "ruling_headline": "Florida is No. 1 in concealed permits, Rick Scott says", "ruling_headline_slug": "florida-no-1-concealed-permits-rick-scott-says", "ruling_link_text": "By a wide margin", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tTampa Bay Times, <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/constant-competitors-rick-scott-and-rick-perry-fight-over-fish/1245649\">Constant competitors Rick Scott and Rick Perry renew rivalry at sea</a>, Aug. 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTampa Bay Times, <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/rick-scott-hedges-ryan-plan-and-medicare\">Rick Scott/Rick Perry Fox News transcript</a>, Aug. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Government Accountability Office, <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/600/592552.pdf\">concealed weapons permit data by state</a>, July 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 32, "current_job": "Governor", "false_count": 26, "first_name": "Rick", "half_true_count": 40, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 383, "last_name": "Scott", "mostly_true_count": 36, "name_slug": "rick-scott", "pants_count": 8, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/rlscott.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/383/", "total_count": 166, "true_count": 15, "website": "http://www.flgov.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tFlorida has &quot;more concealed weapons permits than any other state.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Fox News interview", "statement_date": "2012-08-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 19, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/19/", "subject": "Guns", "subject_slug": "guns", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
