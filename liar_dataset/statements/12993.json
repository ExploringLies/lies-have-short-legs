In the 2016 rematch, Feingold has reversed course and is now taking the majority of his money from out of state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson frames this as a broken promise in a recent<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9navJb1X7Y\"> campaign ad</a>, noting that at the time Feingold&rsquo;s pledge originated he did not limit it to any time period. Rather, he declared he was making the commitment &quot;for the future.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Feingold&rsquo;s promise</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin examined this issue before, giving Feingold a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/28/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-changes-his-tune-campaign-contributi/\">Full Flop</a>&quot; in October 2015 for reversing his position and accepting a majority of his funding from out of state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Flip-O-Meter ruling only examined whether Feingold had changed his position &mdash; which he clearly did. We are taking another look because Johnson now alleges that in doing so Feingold broke a promise to always get the majority of his funding from Wisconsinites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad is the latest volley on this point, which Johnson has also made in an<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/johnson-hits-feingold-for-dropping-past-fundraising-pledge-b99556775z1-321819341.html\"> interview</a>, a<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ronjohnsonwi/status/768107877517004800\"> tweet</a> and on<a href=\"https://www.ronjohnsonforsenate.com/feingold-broken-promises/\"> his website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you ask Feingold now, his pledge was always for the campaign at hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When I said in 1992, whenever I said that I would get a majority of my contributions from Wisconsin citizens, I made that pledge for that term,&quot; Feingold said in January 2016 as part of an &quot;<a href=\"https://law-media.marquette.edu/Mediasite/Play/2f047685105f407593187b706299a0681d\">On The Issues with Mike Gousha</a>&quot; appearance at Marquette University Law School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the tape.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold stated in a 1992 TV ad that he would &quot;rely on Wisconsin citizens, not out-of-staters, to pay for this campaign&quot; -- a promise he touted often.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he also took it a step further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an August 1992<a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?31671-1/wisconsin-senate-debate\"> primary debate</a> on C-SPAN, an opponent accused Feingold of making a self-serving pledge because he was a newcomer to national races who didn&rsquo;t have the out-of-state contacts his opponents did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s not just self-serving, because I&rsquo;m promising it for the future,&quot; Feingold responded. &quot;I&rsquo;m saying that&rsquo;s a pledge that I&rsquo;m going to keep. I&rsquo;m not going to get in (office) and go, &lsquo;OK, where are the PACs and where are the out-of-state contributions?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m making a pledge for the future.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is clearly not a pledge Feingold is keeping this time around. An analysis of Federal Election Commission data by the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/geog.php?cycle=2016&amp;id=WIS2&amp;spec=N\">Center for Responsive Politics</a> shows 70 percent of individual contributions to Feingold&rsquo;s campaign during this election cycle have come from out of state. That&rsquo;s the same number cited by Johnson in the ad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold has acknowledged the change in position, asserting in an<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/johnson-hits-feingold-for-dropping-past-fundraising-pledge-b99556775z1-321819341.html\"> August 2015 interview</a> that keeping the 24-year-old pledge &quot;makes no sense now&quot; since the campaign finance landscape has changed dramatically due to a deluge of massive, undisclosed contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We encountered a similar question in 2014 when the group One Wisconsin Now claimed Walker broke a promise not to take contributions during the budget process -- a claim we rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/29/one-wisconsin-now/scott-walker-pledged-not-take-campaign-money-durin/\">False</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that case, the group misrepresented the nature of the promise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the pledge was from Walker&rsquo;s brief gubernatorial bid in 2006, not his successful bid in 2010. And the promise, part of his first 100 days plan, referred to a specific period: &quot;Scott Walker will not accept any campaign contributions (from any source) from the time he takes office (January 3, 2007) until the state budget is signed into law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not the case for Feingold, who repeatedly cited the pledge, said at the time the &nbsp;promise was &quot;for the future,&quot; and then went on to follow it for three future campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Tyler, a spokesman for Feingold&rsquo;s campaign, declined repeated requests to comment on how Feingold reconciles the &quot;for the future&quot; line with his current assertion that the promise, from the start, was only for the campaign at hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feingold used the words &quot;pledge&quot; and &quot;promise&quot; in 1992 while asserting his grassroots funding plan was for that election as well as &quot;for the future.&quot; The future is here, and Feingold has failed to keep his promise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only that, he claims he never said the pledge applied going forward, despite video evidence to the contrary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnson&rsquo;s ad includes several clips that, while short, are used in context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Johnson&rsquo;s claim True.</p> <a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/88b81dd7-e06d-4c6e-97f2-3eba9e4c5b9c\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/88b81dd7-e06d-4c6e-97f2-3eba9e4c5b9c</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-01T10:57:15.756100", "ruling_date": "2016-09-07T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Did Russ Feingold break promise to fund campaign primarily in state?", "ruling_headline_slug": "feingold-broke-promise-fund-campaign-primarily-sta", "ruling_link_text": "It was 'a pledge for the future'", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Twitter,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ronjohnsonwi/status/768107877517004800\">Ron Johnson</a>, Aug. 23, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, Russ Feingold &quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/mVLFesWD-P0?t=74\">Home Movies</a>&quot;
