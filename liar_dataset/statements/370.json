So we dusted off our multiplication tables and checked Obama's math.\n</p>\n<p>\n According to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. imported 10,102,000 barrels per day of oil during the week ending Feb. 15. The average world price for a barrel of oil that same week was $89.91. That means energy firms spent $908 million on foreign oil daily in mid-February.\n</p>\n<p>\n Obama's campaign said they used  $100 for the price of a barrel of oil, a record reached Feb. 19 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n</p>\n<p>\n That number has since dropped a bit &ndash; to $98.86 as of Friday afternoon. Redoing the math, what we spend abroad comes awfully close to the billion-dollar figure Obama quotes. It's 998.2 million.\n</p>\n<p>\n We'll allow him to round up. Obama gets a gold star in math, and we find his statement True.\n</p>\n<p>\n &nbsp;\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:22.171504", "ruling_date": "2008-02-22T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Yes, a costly addiction ", "ruling_headline_slug": "yes-a-costly-addiction-", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, a costly addiction ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n U.S. Energy Information Administration,\n <a href=\"http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_wkly_dc_NUS-Z00_mbblpd_w.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Weekly Imports &amp; Exports\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n U.S. Energy Information Administration,\n <a href=\"http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_wco_k_w.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\n  World Crude Oil Prices\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n New York Mercantile Exchange,\n <a href=\"http://www.nymex.com/index.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Crude Oil Prices\n </a>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\"We send a billion dollars to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a debate in Austin, Texas.", "statement_date": "2008-02-21", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
