Her general election opponent Donald Trump has taken advantage of it and branded her &quot;Crooked Hillary,&quot; whether it&rsquo;s true or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But how severe are Clinton&rsquo;s trust issues?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Congressman Tom Marino, one of Trump&rsquo;s biggest backers in Pennsylvania, it&rsquo;s apparently an all or nothing proposition -- almost no one trusts her,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/07/rnc_2016_you_could_win_this_wh.html\">if what he said Monday</a>&nbsp;during a Pennsylvania GOP breakfast at the Republican National Convention is any indication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Secretary Clinton has so much baggage that the luggage industry could name a line of suitcases after her,&quot; Marino, R-10th District,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/07/rnc_2016_you_could_win_this_wh.html\">said during the breakfast, according to PennLive</a>. &quot;She&#39;s not trusted -- virtually at all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has admitted that she has concerns that voters don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s honest. But the idea that she&rsquo;s not trusted &quot;virtually at all&quot; seemed a little off. How do you measure trust? And is that number at or close to zero? Here&rsquo;s what we could find.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Believe it or not, lots of national and state polls ask voters about whether or not they perceive candidates to be honest or trustworthy, largely because it&rsquo;s one of the character traits voters consider most. A Quinnipiac poll from late June showed 28 percent of voters said honesty and trustworthiness was the most important character trait, the highest rate of any trait including integrity and leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And though more voters roundly trust Clinton over Trump in areas like foreign policy and leadership experience, they don&rsquo;t trust her as a person as much as they do him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/politics/washington-post-abc-news-national-poll-march-3-6-2016/1982/\">A poll commissioned by the Washington Post and ABC</a>&nbsp;in March found only 37 percent of voters found Clinton to be honest and trustworthy. An NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll from June showed 69 percent of voters were concerned Clinton had a reputation of dishonesty. And a CBS poll from around the same time 63 percent of voters found Clinton to be dishonest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These ratings are just a few points higher than Trump&rsquo;s. And yes, Trump leads Clinton in the forthcoming category. Only a third of voters think Clinton says what she means while more than half of voters think Trump does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If, during his GOP breakfast speech, Marino was talking about Republicans trusting Clinton, he&rsquo;s in luck: That Quinnipiac poll from late June shows just 6 percent of Republicans polled think Clinton is trustworthy. But Marino&rsquo;s camp didn&rsquo;t respond to a request for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voter perception of Clinton&rsquo;s trustworthiness started dwindling even during her days as First Lady following the Whitewater scandal, a fraud investigation into the real estate investments the Clintons made while Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas. Neither Clinton ever faced charges over it, but their close associates did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the controversy over the email server she used while Secretary of State appears to be what&rsquo;s contributing to voters&rsquo; lack of trust. That&rsquo;s been compounded since FBI Director James Comey directly contradicted statements Clinton made about what was sent on the server during a press conference announcing that charges wouldn&rsquo;t be filed against the presidential candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Hagen, an associate professor at Temple University and a former director of the Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University, said the email situation has had a substantial impact on the percentage of the electorate that regards her as dishonest and untrustworthy, driving those numbers up to about three in five voters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There are even a number of Democrats who have reservations about her trustworthiness,&quot; Hagen said, noting that trustworthiness is &quot;important to lots of folks, but it&rsquo;s not the only thing that people are talking about or concerned about.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s campaign didn&rsquo;t respond to a request for comment. But she knows this is hurting her. She&rsquo;s admitted that she has work to do to bring back voters in the &quot;honesty&quot; arena, but has also blamed decades of facing criticism from the right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I take this seriously, as someone who is asking for your votes, and I personally know I have work to do on this point,&quot; she said during a talk in June,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/06/27/clinton-calls-saving-lives-through-gun-control-a-civil-rights-issue/?tid=a_inl\">according to&nbsp;<em>The Washington Post</em>.</a>&nbsp;&quot;A lot of people tell pollsters they don&#39;t trust me. I don&#39;t like hearing that, and I&#39;ve thought a lot about what&#39;s behind it&hellip; You know you hear 25 years worth of wild accusations, anyone could start to wonder.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether they&rsquo;re wild accusations or not, the big news that turns into scandals that revolve around Clinton seem to have a different effect on voters perception of trustworthiness compared to a steady drumbeat of criticism over statements made by Trump. While most of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/hillary-clinton/\">Clinton&rsquo;s statements rated by&nbsp;<em>PolitiFact</em></a>&nbsp;have been True or Mostly True, the majority of Trump&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/\">have been False or Pants on Fire.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hagen said scandal sticks in the minds of voters more than those daily stories criticizing Trump&rsquo;s dishonesty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Fact-checking stories appear inside newspapers,&quot; he said, &quot;but scandals make front-page headlines.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marino said with regard to Clinton: &quot;She&#39;s not trusted -- virtually at all.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is clearly hyperbole when it comes to all voters, but not far from the truth when looking at the polling of Republican voters. Clinton&#39;s admitted herself that she&#39;s struggled when it comes to voters trusting her, so the sentiment of this claim makes sense. Still, to say she&rsquo;s not trusted &quot;virtually at all&quot; isn&rsquo;t accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-20T07:45:20.667184", "ruling_date": "2016-07-20T08:51:53", "ruling_headline": "PA Congressman\u2019s misleading claim: Hillary Clinton trusted by \u2018virtually\u2019 no one", "ruling_headline_slug": "pa-congressmans-claim-hillary-clinton-trusted-virt", "ruling_link_text": "Slow down with the hyperbole", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>News article, PennLive. &quot;RNC 2016: &lsquo;You could win this whole thing, Pa.,&rsquo; U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan says.&quot; July 18, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News article, CNN. &quot;Poll: Clinton leads Trump.&quot; June 16, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News article, Washington Post. &quot;Clinton says she understands many people don&rsquo;t trust her, promises to earn it.&quot; June 27, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview, Michael Hagen.
