Michael Doherty.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA story in <em>The Sunday Star-Ledger</em> revealed three officials from the Union County school district allegedly enrolled their children in a subsidized lunch program, even though they earn too much to qualify for it. Doherty (R-Warren), one of several New Jersey officials who called for an investigation into the matter, wrote a letter to acting state Education Commissioner Christopher Cerf saying he&rsquo;s worried the program opens another avenue for abuse.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This year, when you appeared before the Senate Budget Committee, I informed you about the potential for abuse of the free and reduced price lunch program, and how enrolling a student in the program triggers an &quot;At Risk&quot; designation, which results in an additional $6,000-7,000 of state school aid for a student,&quot; Doherty wrote to Cerf in an Aug. 22 letter. &quot;This additional school aid, which can exceed hundreds of millions of dollars, is collected from taxpayers throughout the state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey found Doherty is mostly right: when a student is enrolled in the federally supported lunch program, they are designated as at risk. But his claim that each at-risk student brings in up to $7,000 in additional state aid needs clarification. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll first explain how an at-risk designation translates into increased per-pupil spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe &quot;School Funding Reform Act of 2008&quot; set up the formula that calculates how state education spending is determined for New Jersey school districts. The formula sets a minimum amount that the state believes must be spent on a student to provide a &quot;thorough and efficient education.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe base amount can increase depending on a variety of factors, including whether a student is considered at risk. At-risk students include those who qualify for a free or reduce-price lunch, according to state law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn at-risk student is weighted differently in the formula, increasing the amount of funds the state believes should be spent to educate that child. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, we&rsquo;ve determined Doherty is correct about the at-risk designation. But what about his claim that for each at-risk student, a school district receives up to $7,000 more in state aid?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state auditor released a report in June, which said: &quot;The Department of Education&#39;s state formula aid per the School Funding Reform Act of 2008 is increased to a school district by between $4,700 and $5,700 for each student eligible for the school lunch program.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStephen Eells, the state auditor, said his department calculated the aid figures based on the minimum per-pupil spending amount set by the state -- and then rounded the figures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, a student in a school district where less than 20 percent of the population is considered at-risk receives about $4,700 more in aid. For districts, like Elizabeth, where more than 60 percent of the student population is considered at risk a student brings in nearly $5,700 in more aid, per Eells calculation. &nbsp;Other districts fall somewhere within that range, Eells said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJustin Barra, a spokesman for the state education department, said the education department doesn&rsquo;t calculate specific costs for at-risk pupils because it is just one of many factors. But, he said in an email that the state &quot;estimates that no district receives more than $6,000 per at-risk student, with a significant number much lower than that, and some receiving no funding at all.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoherty told us his figures were in reference to districts like Elizabeth, but he doesn&rsquo;t make that clear in his letter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, his numbers aren&rsquo;t far off from the state auditor&rsquo;s figures for a district with a student population that includes more than 60 percent of at-risk students.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&#39;s the difference. Doherty included money for security aid, which is increased from a base amount of $70 per student to up to more than $400 per at-risk student, according to the state funding formula.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoherty also included at-risk students who are bilingual, a designation that further increases per-pupil spending by his calculations to nearly $7,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoherty said school districts receive an additional $6,000 to $7,000 in state aid for every student enrolled in a free or reduced-price lunch program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoherty was right that more education funding is allocated for students who receive a subsidized lunch. Though the amount of that funding varies by district, we think Doherty&rsquo;s statement is on point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/subsidized_lunch_programs_come.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-08-24T18:16:19.889131", "ruling_date": "2011-08-25T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "State Sen.
