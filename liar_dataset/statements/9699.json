Bruce Braley focuses on the minimum wage as part of his campaign&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/bruce-braley-iowa-minimum-wage-joni-ernst-109479.html?hp=r5\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>effort</u></a> to paint Ernst as &quot;too extreme&quot; for Iowa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It uses video and audio clips of Ernst speaking at primary debates and in interviews as evidence for the claim that she does not &quot;think there should be a national minimum wage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the most recent <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2014/senate/ia/iowa_senate_ernst_vs_braley-3990.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>polls</u></a>, Ernst and Braley are nearly tied. We wanted to know if this latest attack ad was accurate: Does Ernst oppose a national minimum wage?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first attack on Ernst for her position on the minimum wage. In a June <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9cJHjtLbp8\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>ad</u></a>, the Iowa Democratic Party accused Ernst of flip-flopping on the issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to take a look back at Ernst&rsquo;s public statements and positions on the minimum wage, but it can get confusing. So we compiled a timeline to see if her views changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>January 2014</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Jan. 9, 2014 Braley released a <a href=\"http://braley.house.gov/sites/braley.house.gov/files/documents/Congressional.Report.Braley.Restoring.Minimum.Wage.January.2014.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>report</u></a> on minimum wage that suggested raising the national figure to $10.10 an hour. Ernst disagreed. &quot;I believe that businesses will do what is best for their business,&quot; she said in an interview the same day. &quot;I don&rsquo;t know that the government needs to be stepping in and telling them this is what you will do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>February 2014</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ernst&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://qctimes.com/news/local/government-and-politics/report-minimum-wage-boost-would-cost-jobs-lower-poverty/article_76d256ab-f8f4-5889-a67a-822892bd14ca.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>opposition</u></a> to the federal government&rsquo;s role in raising a minimum wage continued. &quot;Government and government-mandated wage increases are not the solution,&quot; she said, as reported in a <em>Quad-City Times</em> story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>March 2014</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a candidate <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/90759765\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>forum</u></a> held by the National Federation of Independent Business on March 18, 2014, Ernst said this: &quot;I do believe it is best left up to the states. Our state economies are much different from state to state, so I don&rsquo;t believe the federal government should be involved in setting the minimum wage.&quot; Ernst also talked about the great opportunity she had working a minimum wage job as a biscuit maker at Hardee&rsquo;s. &quot;I think $7.25 is appropriate for Iowa,&quot; she concluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>April 2014</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an April <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SOUGjXFvHY\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>debate</u></a> Ernst said she would not raise Iowa&rsquo;s minimum wage. She argued that minimum wage jobs were &quot;introductory level&quot; positions and eventually workers could progress into better paying jobs as they acquired more skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>June 2014</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ernst <a href=\"http://iowapublicradio.org/post/candidate-profile-joni-ernst\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>appeared</u></a> on Iowa Public Radio for a candidate profile on June 1, 2014. When asked about increasing the minimum wage, Ernst responded with a familiar line. &quot;I do not support a federal minimum wage. Every state has a different economy, different cost of living. I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s the role of the federal government,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But she seemed to soften that position in late June. After Ernst won the Republican primary she suggested the minimum wage should be left as it is but not raised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I never called for the abolishment of it. Never,&quot; Ernst <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/06/23/can-joni-ernst-be-stopped\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>said</u></a> to U.S. News and World Report on June 23, 2014. &quot;I&rsquo;m saying I don&rsquo;t support a $10.10 minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is somewhat contradictory as her earlier comments suggested she saw no role for the federal government in setting the minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked about it, Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel said Ernst believes that decisions about the minimum wage should be made &quot;locally, not in Washington.&quot; Ernst believes that &quot;Iowans know what&rsquo;s best for Iowa and that&rsquo;s where these decisions belong -- on the state level.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>July 2014</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact asked the Ernst campaign on July 31, 2014, about Ernst&#39;s position on the minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact: &quot;Does she believe that the federal government should play any role at all in deciding the minimum wage? Or should it be left up to the states entirely?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel: &quot;While in college Joni worked for minimum wage at Hardee&rsquo;s and believes the minimum wage is a safety net. Joni does not believe in Washington&rsquo;s one size fits all approach; that&rsquo;s why any decision pertaining to the minimum wage rate going forward needs to be decided locally, not in Washington. What&rsquo;s right for New York or California, is not necessarily right for Iowa.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact: &quot;In a couple of debates and interviews she refers to the minimum wage as a &#39;safety net.&#39; What exactly does she mean by that?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hamel: &quot;The baseline minimum wage that has been set.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Braley said that Ernst does not support a &quot;national minimum wage.&quot; Ernst&#39;s public statements have been confusing at times, but overall, she has said repeatedly that states should decide the minimum wage, not the federal government. She&#39;s also called the minimum wage a &quot;safety net,&quot; and her campaign told us that by that she means the current baseline minimum wage.&nbsp; Overall, we rate Braley&#39;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-01T10:40:33.076314", "ruling_date": "2014-08-01T13:35:20", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Senate candidate Joni Ernst does not support a national minimum wage, says her opponent", "ruling_headline_slug": "iowa-senate-candidate-rep-bruce-braley-says-joni-e", "ruling_link_text": "Let the states decide, Ernst says", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Bruce Braley campaign ad, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEtpLZuNCvs\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Minimum</u></a>,&quot;
