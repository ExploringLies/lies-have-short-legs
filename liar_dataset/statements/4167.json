Many of the ads are being aired by outside groups.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerhaps no television ad is more startling -- and graphic -- than one being aired in Green Bay and Madison by a group called Wisconsin Family Action. It targets state Rep. Fred Clark (D-Baraboo), challenger to state Sen. Luther Olsen (R-Ripon).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad, bearing the theme &quot;Legislators should lead by example,&quot; runs through Clark&rsquo;s checkered driving record -- speeding, previous accidents, driving with a suspended license -- and concludes with a disturbing video of an SUV hitting a bicyclist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the video, an SUV zips into the frame, slamming into a bicyclist who rode into the intersection. As the crash occurs, the narrator intones: &quot;Fred Clark ran this red light, seriously injuring this bicyclist.&quot; The audio includes the sound of squealing tires and the shocked voice of a witness on the bus.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(The ad is not available online. A Madison television station did a story about the ad, which includes much of its content that you can see <a href=\"http://www.channel3000.com/news/28602223/detail.html\">here</a>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid Fred Clark really crash into a bicyclist?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeyond that, is the video actually from the incident? And who was at fault?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s backpedal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Madison <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/madison+police.pdf\">police report</a> shows that Clark was involved in car-bike accident on Aug. 18, 2009, near the state Capitol. According to the report:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClark was driving his 2008 Ford Escape north on Hamilton Street about 4:25 p.m. The bicyclist, a 57-year-old Madison man, was heading north on Webster Street. when he was struck by Clark&rsquo;s SUV. The report said that Clark &quot;violated the red traffic signal&quot; before striking the biker who had a green light.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I ran a red light,&quot; Clark told an officer at the scene, the report says. &quot;I was just not paying attention.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe cyclist was taken to University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics with back and lung injuries, which the report called &quot;incapacitating.&quot; An officer attempted to speak with the victim at the hospital but said the man was unable to do so because of his injuries.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClark received an $88 ticket for running the red light.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter the incident hit the news, his office issued a statement from Clark: &quot;At this time, my first concern is for the well-being of the cyclist who was injured. What occurred was an accident, and my thoughts are with that person and his family.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what of the video in the ad?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hPB9t1qCas\">video</a> is real, and it comes from the dashboard camera of a Madison Metro bus that was stopped at the light on Webster Street. The light changes and the bus begins to move into the intersection when Clark&rsquo;s SUV cuts in front of it and strikes the bike, which approached the intersection alongside the bus.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJulaine Appling, president of Wisconsin Family Actionl, a group that advocates against same sex marriage and &quot;foundational issues such as marriage, life and liberty&quot; did not respond to requests for comment about the ad. Likewise, neither Clark nor his campaign was available to discuss the ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo where does that leave us?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA television ad produced by Wisconsin Family Action against recall challenger Clark highlights his checkered driving record. With video, the ad says Clark struck a bicyclist. The video is real and the accident happened as described.
