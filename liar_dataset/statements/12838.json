We looked through television programming from both events <a href=\"http://www.iq.media/\">using a recording service</a> that chronicles and time-stamps live television programming. Here&rsquo;s what we found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What aired</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith&rsquo;s speech, on the first night of the Republican National Convention July 18, 2016, began around 8:24 p.m. ET.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The speech was aired live by both <em>CNN </em>and <em>MSNBC.</em> It was not live on<em> Fox News</em>, coincidentally. <em>Fox News</em> went to commercial right before Smith took the&nbsp;stage and returned to a phone interview between Donald Trump and <em>Fox News&rsquo; </em>Bill O&rsquo;Reilly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Lou Dobbs Tonight</em> on the Fox Business channel had footage of the speech, but no audio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broadcast networks, <em>NBC, CBS, ABC </em>and <em>FOX</em>, did not cover any convention programming before 10 p.m. ET.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Khan&rsquo;s speech aired at 9:13 p.m. ET on July 28, 2016, from Philadelphia. Again, it was aired live by <em>CNN</em> and <em>MSNBC</em> but not <em>Fox News</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Fox News</em> was in a commercial when Khan began speaking. The cable network showed pictures of Khan speaking on the side&nbsp;but did not have audio. When <em>Fox News&nbsp;</em>returned from the break, it went to a press conference on ISIS by FBI director James Comey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>C-SPAN</em> also covered both speeches live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <em>Fox News </em>spokeswoman did not respond to our request for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kilmeade said &quot;nobody&quot; aired Patricia Smith&rsquo;s remarks live, but &quot;almost everybody&quot; covered Khan&rsquo;s remarks live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>CNN, MSNBC </em>and<em> C-SPAN</em>&nbsp;covered both speeches live. Coincidentally, Fox News &mdash; of which Kilmeade is an employee &mdash; covered neither live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Point being: the speeches were covered the same.
