When asked about the Democrats&rsquo; midterm election losses, Obama said the big takeaway is that Americans don&rsquo;t think Washington is working -- even though the economy is getting better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The economy has improved significantly. There&#39;s no doubt about it,&quot; Obama said. &quot;We had a jobs report for October that showed that once again over 200,000 jobs created. We&#39;ve now created more than 10 million. The unemployment rate&#39;s come down faster than we could have anticipated. Just to give you some perspective, Bob, we&#39;ve created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By many metrics, the United States has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/23/barack-obama/obama-us-has-recovered-recession-better-almost-eve/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>bounced back</u></a> from the recession better than other advanced countries.

(The <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bureau of Labor Statistics</u></a> puts the figure at about 5.7 million.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither figure is literally more than all of the other 35 countries labeled an advanced economy, as Obama said,&nbsp;but it&rsquo;s fairly close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it is clearly more than the other G7 countries -- Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom -- combined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is one wrinkle with the IMF&#39;s list.&nbsp;The IMF&rsquo;s advanced economies list includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, which are not recognized as independent countries but added more than 1 million jobs. If you chose to exclude them from the IMF&#39;s list, Obama would be correct,&nbsp;Harvard economist Jeffrey Frankel told us. (Though Obama said &quot;advanced economy&quot; not country.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Some caveats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So you could make a case that Obama is right. But you can also say that he&#39;s off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are&nbsp;some other obvious caveats to point out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, the United States is the most populous of these countries -- more than twice the population of Japan, which is the next most populous advanced economy (China, Russia and India do not make this list). So it&rsquo;s logical that there will, in general, be higher job gains in absolute numbers compared to smaller nations. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the percentage growth rate instead of the absolute number of jobs helps to account for the population differences among these advanced nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And by that measurement, the United States&rsquo; growth rate is lower than quite a few nations on this list, including: Australia, Austria, Canada, Estonia, Germany, Iceland, Israel, South Korea, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The country with the highest job growth rate was Singapore, with a rate of more than 18 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also,&nbsp;the number of jobs in the United States has just this year returned to a point near pre-recession levels. The United States hemorrhaged jobs in the last months of 2008 and the first few months of 2009. <img alt=\"us_employment_for_the_past_decade.png\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wOrI8nR7FqSSXep1LG4FQuRc_UDHRYIbvLbjmK73Np0jadt6_MMYIhpBwEHzjQqem8uUGN2ujsRMW85tdVDUmzq3OeQEg9P0blc1uWVzL2sq-KN90cFCvTxst1xkNwe3zw\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:398px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:659px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that Obama hasn&rsquo;t had non-stop job growth throughout his presidency. There have been months of overall job loss, particularly in that first year, amidst the recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, noted that this job growth is likely not attributable to any of Obama&rsquo;s actions, even though the economic recovery happened to start soon after he took office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Overall these sorts of comparisons mean little because employment outcomes have more to do with the economic environments more generally rather than specifically the president&#39;s policies,&quot; Sinclair said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama said, &quot;We&#39;ve created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using a straight definition of advanced economic nations from the International Monetary Fund, Obama is slightly off. The United States has added less jobs than a group of 35 other advanced economic nations combined, not more. However, you can make the argument that two countries on the list -- Hong Kong and Taiwan -- should be excluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s equally and perhaps more noteworthy is that when you look at the rate of job growth, which accounts for population differences, the United States trails other advanced nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, we rate Obama&#39;s claim&nbsp;Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-11-09T10:43:15.823292", "ruling_date": "2014-11-09T18:00:08", "ruling_headline": "Obama: Since 2009, U.S. has created more jobs than 'every other advanced economy combined'", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-2009-us-has-created-more-jobs-every-other-ad", "ruling_link_text": "A big share, but not quite", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/23/barack-obama/obama-us-has-recovered-recession-better-almost-eve/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Barack Obama says U.S. has recovered from recession better than almost every advanced country</u></a>,&quot; July 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/full_2014_economic_report_of_the_president.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Economic Report of the President,</u></a>&quot; March 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMF, <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/weodata/index.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>World Economic Outlook database</u></a>, accessed July 22, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/business/employment-in-us-lags-where-it-was-in-2007.html?adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1415545961-iq8zDxbLMXwyX37bmHdBCw\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Many Rival Nations Surge Past the U.S. in Adding New Jobs</u></a>,&quot; June 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Tara Sinclair, George Washington University economist, Nov. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jeffrey Frankel, Harvard University economist, Nov. 9, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with White House spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman, Nov. 9, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal;\">&quot;We&#39;ve created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office.&quot;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation\"", "statement_date": "2014-11-09", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
