Applicants would have had to <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2005/data/lc_amdt/sb403.pdf\">complete a firearms safety </a><a href=\"http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2005/data/lc_amdt/sb403.pdf\">course</a> or similar training. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(<a href=\"http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lrb/pubs/wb/06wb6.pdf\">At the time</a>, only Wisconsin, Illinois and Nebraska did not have laws allowing concealed carry; <a href=\"http://www.nraila.org/maps/rtc.jpg\">today</a>, only Wisconsin and Illinois don&rsquo;t permit it.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill, after being passed by both houses of the Legislature, was vetoed by Gov. Jim Doyle. The Senate voted to override the veto, but an override vote in the Assembly failed. Vukmir voted <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2005/data/votes/av0415.pdf\">for the </a><a href=\"http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2005/data/votes/av0415.pdf\">bill</a> and <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2005/data/votes/av0462.pdf\">to </a><a href=\"http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2005/data/votes/av0462.pdf\">override</a> Doyle&rsquo;s veto.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s look at each of the places Sullivan cites and what the bill said about them:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Churches and health care clinics: </strong>The owner or authorized representative of a church or clinic could have given permission to a person who has a concealed carry license to bring a concealed weapon inside.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Day care centers:</strong> Concealed carry would have been allowed only for the owner of a day care facility and, for day cares operated out of a home, the residents of the home.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Playgrounds:</strong> Concealed carry would have been allowed at parks and playgrounds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means of the four places cited by Sullivan, Vukmir supported allowing a limited number of people into three of the them. In some cases, such as a church or health care center, the pastor or operator would have been able to bar concealed weapons from the building. Only with playgrounds would Vukmir have allowed a wider group -- those who completed training and had received a permit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo let&rsquo;s take stock.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a campaign flier, Sullivan says Vukmir, &quot;supports allowing people to carry concealed weapons&quot; into day cares, churches and other places. As stated, Sullivan suggests Vukmir wants to allow most anyone to do so. In reality, the bill in question would have been limited to those who obtained permits and -- in three of the four public places described -- applied to a very limited number of people. &nbsp;That is an important detail left out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Sullivan&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-22T18:38:47.718974", "ruling_date": "2010-10-23T09:01:00",
