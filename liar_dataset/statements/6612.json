That&rsquo;s the nation&rsquo;s second largest private child care provider, and they&rsquo;re going to implement this checklist at nearly 600 child care centers across the country. So we already have commitments that are going to affect hundreds of thousands of children today. Again, that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re excited to be able to launch this. That&#39;s why these partners here today are so important, because we wouldn&#39;t have this announcement if we didn&#39;t have the folks ready to step up and invest and get the ball rolling and be the models, as CentroNia is, to show that we can do this, and it can work.&quot;</em></blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn a related Bright Horizons <a href=\"http://www.brighthorizons.com/resources/pdf/pr/060811_ECE_Announcement.pdf\">news release</a>, she was quoted as saying, &quot;If our kids get into the habit of getting up and playing, if their palates warm up to veggies at an early age, and if they&rsquo;re not glued to a TV screen all day, they&rsquo;re on their way to healthy habits for life. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so excited about Let&rsquo;s Move Child Care &ndash; because I know that childcare facilities and home-based providers can be a real building block for an entire generation of healthy kids.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney said the first lady &quot;praised&quot; Bright Horizons.
