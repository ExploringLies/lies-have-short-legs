While this supports Clinton&rsquo;s point that the financial sector has spent money against her, it doesn&rsquo;t back the notion that Wall Street has only attacked her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We consulted with Robert Maguire of the Center for Responsive Politics and Nancy Watzman of the Political TV Ad Archive. Their <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16O_DovKNlPvO8w7z2LPAL_dqIXJxpiLYncJynTXD6rg/edit?usp=sharing\">data</a> shows that Clinton&rsquo;s statement is inaccurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trouble with her claim is Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers aren&rsquo;t a monolithic group. Some have even expressed their support for <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/02/martin-omalley/had-goldman-sachs-ceo-said-his-picks-are-hillary-c/\">Clinton</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/11/guess-what-bernie-sanders-actually-has-backerson-wall-street.html\">Sanders</a>, and their donations are dispersed among Republican and Democratic groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Clinton has been the target of more attack ads than Sanders, more money from the financial industry has been spent hitting each of the remaining Republicans. In fact, the candidate subject to the most Wall Street-funded hits is actually Donald Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ad blitzes against Clinton primarily come from three conservative groups. In addition to the ad we fact-checked, Future45 has run <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/browse/?q=candidate%3A%22Hillary+Clinton%22+AND+sponsor%3A%22Future45%22&amp;order=count\">six others against Clinton</a>. Wall Street donations account for half of the group&rsquo;s funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Crossroads, founded by Karl Rove, has sponsored <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/browse/?q=%22american+crossroads%22&amp;order=count\">eight anti-Clinton ads</a> and the Mitt Romney-affiliated group America Rising has released <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/browse/?q=candidate%3A%22Hillary+Clinton%22+AND+sponsor%3A%22America+Rising%22&amp;order=count\">10 ads</a> attacking her, two of which also target Sanders. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the financial industry is responsible for roughly half of the Rove&rsquo;s group total donations and two-thirds of the Romney group&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Future45 has also sponsored <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/browse/?q=candidate%3A%22Bernie+Sanders%22+AND+sponsor%3A%22Future45%22&amp;order=count\">one ad against Sanders</a>. ESA Fund, a conservative super PAC, is <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/indus.php?cmte=C00489856&amp;cycle=2016\">56 percent</a> funded by the financial sector and has aired <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_berniesanders_ud3s8/\">one anti-Sanders ad</a> in Iowa. And last summer, Generation Forward, a pro-Martin O&rsquo;Malley super PAC, went after <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/10/generation-forward-pac/did-bernie-sanders-vote-against-background-checks-/\">Sanders&rsquo; record on guns</a>. A fifth of its donations come from Wall Street. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s own affiliated super PAC, Priorities USA Action, took <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/indus.php?cmte=C00495861&amp;cycle=2016\">a third</a> of its donations from the financial sector. It has aired <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/browse/?q=candidate%3A%22Donald+Trump%22+AND+sponsor%3A%22Priorities+USA%22&amp;order=count\">11 ads</a> against Trump and spent more than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/recips.php?cmte=C00495861&amp;cycle=2016\">$61,000</a> targeting the Republican frontrunner. (Update: Priorities USA Action said that the 11 videos it produced only appeared on the Internet.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that pales in comparison to the amount of money and airtime Trump&rsquo;s fellow Republicans have devoted to slamming him. Conservative groups have spent more than <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16O_DovKNlPvO8w7z2LPAL_dqIXJxpiLYncJynTXD6rg/edit?usp=sharing\">$28 million opposing Trump</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Principles PAC, launched by a former Romney aide, has spent more than $14 million against Trump and sponsored at least <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/browse/?q=candidate%3A%22Donald+Trump%22+AND+sponsor%3A%22Our+Principles+PAC%22&amp;order=count\">27 ads</a> attacking him. A third of the group&rsquo;s funding comes from Wall Street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marco Rubio&rsquo;s affiliated super PAC, Conservative Solutions, aired <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/browse/?q=candidate%3A%22Donald+Trump%22+AND+sponsor%3A%22Conservative+Solutions%22&amp;order=count\">seven anti-Trump ads</a> and received about 40 percent of its funding from the financial sector. Rubio himself was the subject of <a href=\"https://politicaladarchive.org/browse/?q=candidate%3A%22Marco+Rubio%22+AND+sponsor%3A%22Keep+the+Promise%22&amp;order=count\">11 attack ads</a> by Ted Cruz&rsquo;s Keep the Promise I super PAC (hedge fund manager Robert Mercer was responsible for <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-hedgefunds-idUSKCN0WC19G\">$11 million</a> of its <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/indus.php?cmte=C00575373&amp;cycle=2016\">$11,036,250</a> total donations), and <a
