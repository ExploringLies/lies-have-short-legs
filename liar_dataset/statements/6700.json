Tommy Thompson isn&rsquo;t the man he used to be.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThree new ads use Thompson&rsquo;s own words in building a case that the U.S. Senate candidate changed for the worse after leaving President George W. Bush&rsquo;s cabinet and making millions in part by working on behalf of drug companies, financial firms and other interests.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbFRtfbleG8\">spot</a>, by the political arm of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal workers uses a snippet of a Thompson quote -- &quot;... Washington changed us &hellip;&quot; -- to bookend allegations that he&rsquo;s changed so much he now &quot;supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnother spot, by Tammy Baldwin, the Democrat seeking the Senate seat, uses it in support of an allegation regarding Thompson and drug companies.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYWAfSF8x94\">newest ad</a>, by the <a href=\"http://www.dscc.org/\">Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee</a>, uses the same snippet to say Thompson &quot;admitted&quot; being a guy who flew off to D.C. and &quot;hasn&rsquo;t looked back.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe list of grievances in the DSCC ad is long. Amid generic images of corporate deal-making, the spot says Thompson &quot;sold his influence and connections, becoming a partner in a powerful Washington lobbying firm, working for Wall Street and the big drug companies, making millions from the special interests at our expense.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt skips any mention of Thompson&rsquo;s four-year stint running the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services before he went to work in 2005 as a legal partner at the Washington, D.C., lobbying firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad ends with the narrator saying, &quot;Thompson even admitted&hellip;&quot; before the screen cuts to Thompson remarking at a presidential debate during his 2008 run: &quot;Washington changed us.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNarrator: &quot;Yes it did.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJust what was Thompson owning up to in the quote?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReturn with us to the June 5, 2007 CNN-sponsored presidential debate in Manchester, New Hampshire. John Lewicke, an electrical engineer, posed this long question to a candidate panel that included Thompson and current nominee Mitt Romney:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In 2006, we saw the worst Republican defeat in living memory. If we do more of the same, why do we expect anything different? And I&#39;d like to ask each of the candidates why their position is -- or how their position differs from the present administration&#39;s, so that we won&#39;t see a repeat of 2006 in 2008.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/CNN.doc\">transcript</a> shows the candidates gave answers along two themes: Curb spending (unlike Bush) and show some vision. Few gave any details on spending cuts, other than to suggest banning pork-barrel projects. Ron Paul said the Iraq War costs were too high.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEnter Thompson, questioned by CNN&rsquo;s Wolf Blitzer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em><strong>BLITZER:</strong> &quot;The question is what - what&#39;s President Bush&#39;s biggest mistake over these past several years?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>THOMPSON</strong>: &quot;Because we went to Washington to change Washington and Washington changed us. We didn&#39;t come up with new ideas. We got to transform health care. We got to wind -- we got to wind down the war in Iraq. We got to make sure that we really are conservatives. If we&#39;re going to spend money like - as foolishly and as stupidly as the Democrats, the voters are going to vote for the professional spending, the Democrat not the amateur spender, the Republican.&quot; (Laughter, applause.)</em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere was no commentary on Thompson&rsquo;s private-sector jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRather, it seems clear Thompson&rsquo;s &quot;admission&quot; concerned his regrets, however belated, over policy and budget matters during his days in the Bush cabinet.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/DSCC1.doc\">DSCC </a>uses the quote in the ad to give the false impression Thompson was standing in self-judgment over his work at the time for Akin Gump and others.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen asked about the quote, DSCC spokesman Matt Canter connected the dots this way:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMost observers, he argued, would say that the new Medicare prescription drug benefit created with Thompson&rsquo;s support under Bush was a giveaway to the big pharmaceutical companies. Thompson&rsquo;s debate remarks talked about the failure to transform health care. Therefore, Thompson&rsquo;s &quot;Washington changed us&quot; was an admission that such deals with special interests were wrong, Canter said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be sure, there is a connection between Thompson&rsquo;s cabinet experience and his subsequent private work. PolitiFact Wisconsin has noted that connection in earlier items -- and those items are cited as a source for many of the statements in the ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe noted the connection when we checked a claim by Thompson&rsquo;s GOP primary rival Eric Hovde that Thompson is &quot;a big corporate lobbyist&quot; and has been &quot;lobbying during the middle of the campaign.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rated that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/10/eric-hovde/eric-hovde-says-tommy-thompson-big-corporate-lobby/\">Half True</a>, noting that Thompson is not a registered lobbyist under the strict definition but &quot;has sold his influence and connections to firms to whom it would benefit on Capitol Hill, but did so in a way -- as a consultant -- to avoid having to register.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis link to these firms is clear, and his own disclosure reports show he has made millions in the private sector as a corporate consultant and advisor, executive, investor and speaker.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we&rsquo;re examining the claim that Thompson candidly &quot;admitted&quot; being &quot;changed&quot; by Washington into a corporate influence peddler.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn claiming that Thompson &quot;admitted&quot; he had been changed by Washington and had sold out to make millions, the ad jumbles a snippet from a quote about the failings of himself and other GOP officials while running Washington with his actions after leaving government service.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe effect is to make it appear Thompson is condemning his own conduct and private-sector work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-13T17:08:51.066656", "ruling_date": "2012-09-21T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Democratic group says Thompson admitted Washington, D.C. stint changed him for the worse", "ruling_headline_slug": "democratic-group-says-thompson-admitted-washington", "ruling_link_text": "A misleading cut and paste", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYWAfSF8x94\">campaign TV ad</a>, Sept. 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Matt Canter, DSCC spokesperson, Sept. 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe American Presidency Project, New Hampshire GOP presidential debate, <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=75171\">complete transcript</a>, June 5, 2007<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/CNN.doc\">Partial transcript</a>, New Hampshire debate<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDSCC <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/DSCC1.doc\">news release</a>, Sept. 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "", "id": 430, "last_name": "Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mugs_mug-dnc_.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/430/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.dscc.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson &quot;admitted&quot;
