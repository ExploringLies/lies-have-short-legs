Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Tom Barrett discussed economic development for Milwaukee during a debate on May 31, 2012, five days before Wisconsin&rsquo;s historic gubernatorial recall election.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker <a href=\"http://www.wisn.com/politics/wisconsin-politics/12-News-Gubernatorial-Debate-Part-2/-/10057500/14420666/-/u9g8f9/-/index.html\">said</a> his plan, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/walker-unveils-100-million-economic-plan-for-milwaukees-poorest-areas-q856nuf-149485415.html\">announced</a> a month earlier, is to spend $100 million in a multi-faceted effort to improve &quot;the most impoverished corner&quot; of the city.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn contrast, he claimed Barrett&rsquo;s plan is &quot;to spend $100 million on a trolley that goes barely two miles on the east side of Milwaukee,&quot; suggesting that amount of public money would be used.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrett, the Milwaukee mayor, is the chief supporter of a plan to create a rail system in the city, which he has <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/125612528.html\">said</a> is aimed at growing the city&rsquo;s tax base.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut did Walker describe it accurately?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker used the term trolley for maximum rhetorical effect, but <a href=\"http://www.themilwaukeestreetcar.com/\">what Barrett backs</a> is a modern streetcar that resembles a light-rail vehicle. As the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> has <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/streetcar-project-gets-federal-backing-go40g8r-138346289.html\">reported</a>, the first segment would run two miles from the city&rsquo;s lower east side to the downtown Amtrak/Greyhound station.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, parts of Walker&rsquo;s claim are off in that the streetcar wouldn&rsquo;t run only on the city&rsquo;s east side. And it&rsquo;s more than a &quot;trolley.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut let&rsquo;s get to the larger part of his claim -- that the plan is to spend $100 million. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen asked for backup, Walker campaign spokeswoman Ciara Matthews provided <em>Journal Sentinel</em> news articles in 2011 and 2012 citing various cost figures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Construction -- $64.6 million:</strong> The Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/psc-ruling-to-cover-all-utilities-in-milwaukee-streetcar-project-vg41va1-138593139.html\">reported</a> in February 2012 that $54.9 million would come from federal transit aid and $9.7 million from tax incremental financing, which is done through city borrowing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Debt service -- $5.4 million:</strong> This borrowing would be on top of the borrowing for a downtown tax incremental financing district, resulting in a longer pay-off period and an increase of $5.4 million in debt service costs, the newspaper <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/125206564.html\">reported</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Relocating utilities -- $55 million:</strong> The <em>Journal Sentinel</em> <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/psc-ruling-to-cover-all-utilities-in-milwaukee-streetcar-project-vg41va1-138593139.html\">said</a> utility companies warned that relocating utility lines would cost more than $55 million, but that it had not yet been determined whether the utilities and their customers, the city, or a combination would cover the cost.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, that number is not certain.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoth We Energies and the city have said the final figure could be much lower and, if it isn&rsquo;t, the city could revise its plan -- likely by shifting the route -- to lower the cost of relocating the utilities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf the state Public Service Commission orders the city to pay part of the relocation costs, the Common Council could authorize additional spending, cut the project back or kill it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Annual operation cost -- $2.65 million:</strong> The $1 fares, parking fees and sponsorships would cover operation costs. But they would be borne by streetcar riders and sponsors, not the city.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo recap, using round numbers:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe city has committed to spending $65 million in mostly federal money and borrowed funds to build the streetcar line. The borrowing would add $5 million to the city&rsquo;s debt service costs, for a total of $70 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRelocating utilities could cost another $55 million. But ultimately the figure could be much less and it&rsquo;s unknown whether utility ratepayers or city taxpayers or both would be ordered to cover the cost.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, Matthews cited a July 2011 <em>Journal Sentinel</em> <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/125612528.html\">article</a> that said the city would seek federal money to extend the planned streetcar line. So, she argues, Barrett ultimately supports spending even more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that extra spending is off point, in that Walker limited his claim to the planned two-mile loop. In any case, the newspaper later <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/streetcar-project-gets-federal-backing-go40g8r-138346289.html\">reported</a> that the repeated efforts at getting more money had failed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker said Barrett plans &quot;to spend $100 million on a trolley that goes barely two miles on the east side of Milwaukee,&quot; suggesting the plan is to spend that much in &nbsp;public money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe city has committed to spending $70 million -- for a streetcar that would run from the east side to downtown. And the plan Barrett backs would require utility relocation that could push the total cost above $100 million -- but that&rsquo;s not clear, nor is who would bear the cost.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrett was ready to spend more than $100 million, but that was for a line longer than the two-mile line, and that&rsquo;s not currently in the plan given that efforts to obtain extra funding have failed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date":
