Is freshman Hurd short of time?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Resignation letter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallego&rsquo;s campaign spokesman, Anthony Gutierrez, responded to us by email by pointing out <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/16/house-section/article/H1643-1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a March 2015 entry in the Congressional Record</u></a> showing that Hurd, <a href=\"https://hurd.house.gov/about/full-biography\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a former CIA officer</u></a>, asked to be removed from the committee in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hurd&rsquo;s letter, dated March 16, 2015, said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:45pt; margin-right:90pt\">&quot;I write today to resign from the House Small Business Committee. While I appreciate the honor of being appointed, in order to best serve the constituent of Texas&#39; 23rd Congressional District, I believe I must focus on my existing committee assignments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:45pt; margin-right:90pt\">&quot;With my background in the intelligence community cybersecurity, and representing the district with the largest length of U.S.-Mexico Border, my ability to focus on my Information Technology Subcommittee Chairmanship and Border and Maritime Subcommittee Vice-Chairmanship is where I believe I can be of most value to my constituents and colleagues in the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:45pt; margin-right:90pt\">&quot;I appreciate your timely consideration of this request.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the CR entry, the Texan&rsquo;s resignation was accepted the same day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hurd&#39;s committee assignments</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked next into Hurd&#39;s workload. His <a href=\"https://hurd.house.gov/about/committees-and-caucuses\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>House website</u></a> says Hurd serves on the <a href=\"http://homeland.house.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>House Homeland Security Committee</u></a>; he&rsquo;s vice chair of its <a href=\"http://homeland.house.gov/subcommittee-BMS\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee</u></a> and also serves on its <a href=\"http://homeland.house.gov/subcommittee-CTI\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hurd also serves on the <a href=\"http://oversight.house.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for which he chairs its Information Technology subcommittee</u></a>; his appointment to the chairmanship was described as a plum prize in a February 2015 <em>San Antonio Express-News</em><a href=\"http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Hurd-gets-plum-role-in-Congress-6055571.php\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> news story</u></a> pointed out to us by Shana Teehan, Hurd&rsquo;s communications director. Hurd also serves on the oversight panel&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://oversight.house.gov/subcommittee/subcommittee-on-national-security/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>National Security Subcommittee.</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An online search led us to a <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/committee_info/oal.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>web page</u></a> created by the House clerk, dated Feb. 10, 2015, listing each member&rsquo;s committee assignments. That list showed Hurd as a member of the small business panel plus the two others. Counting Hurd, six Texas members of the House were assigned to three committees each; the other 30 Texans had one or two assignments. And as of April 7, 2015, Hurd was still listed as a member of all three panels on <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/mem_contact_info.aspx?statdis=TX23\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>another House clerk&rsquo;s web page</u></a>. (Previously, Gallego was a member of two committees.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hurd campaign elaborates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, Hurd campaign spokesman Josh Robinson said Hurd initially learned of his appointment to the small business panel from a committee-issued press release. The panel&rsquo;s Jan. 21, 2015, <a href=\"http://smallbusiness.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=397851\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>announcement listed Hurd among 14 committee members</u></a>. According to <a href=\"http://smallbusiness.house.gov/calendar/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the committee&#39;s calendar,</u></a> the panel subsequently met three times before Hurd resigned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hurd appreciated the appointment, Robinson told us, but given his other assignments and desire to travel back and forth to the vast 23rd Congressional District, he decided &quot;being in another committee meeting in D.C. was not going to be helpful.&quot; Hurd, Robinson said, would rather focus on small businesses in his district than &quot;listen to a bunch of bureaucrats&quot; in hearings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chairman Chabot: &#39;Procedural glitch&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, Teehan provided a statement she described as obtained by Hurd&rsquo;s office about March 18, 2015, from Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, who chairs the small business panel. Chabot, praising Hurd&rsquo;s energy and enthusiasm, is quoted saying that even though &quot;a procedural glitch means it is necessary to change his committee assignments, I know he&rsquo;ll be a dedicated voice for working Americans across his district.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teehan also emailed Rep. Lamar Smith&rsquo;s description of Hurd&rsquo;s appointment to the small business panel as &quot;a small administrative matter that has now been corrected.&quot; Smith, R-San Antonio, serves on the House Republican Steering Committee, which Teehan described as responsible for Republican committee assignments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glitch? Administrative error? We left messages for aides to Chabot and Smith seeking elaboration while wondering how this might pertain to Hurd&rsquo;s departure from the committee. We didn&rsquo;t hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we filled in Gallego&rsquo;s adviser, Gutierrez, who pointed out by email that House committee assignments, including Hurd&rsquo;s appointment to the small business committee, were <a href=\"http://1.usa.gov/1CuWz3P\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>entered into the Congressional Record</u></a> on Jan. 13, 2015--eight days before the mentioned press release came out and about two months before Hurd submitted his letter to leave the committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallego said Hurd recently &quot;quit his post on the House Committee on Small Business saying that he was unable to find the time to serve.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hurd, who separately had two other committee assignments, quit the small-business panel stressing his desire to focus on security-related subcommittee assignments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallego&rsquo;s statement, leaving the impression Hurd said he lacked time to serve, left out important details. We rate his claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>HALF TRUE</strong> </em><em>&ndash; The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>more</u></a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-04-07T16:58:18.640637", "ruling_date": "2015-04-07T16:16:44", "ruling_headline": "Pete Gallego, re-seeking seat, says Will Hurd quit House panel saying he couldn't find time for it", "ruling_headline_slug": "pete-gallego-re-seeking-seat-says-will-hurd-quit-h", "ruling_link_text": "Hurd cited focus on other committees", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13vvrjpBSjJVK5Q0BMRnDlTvofYrIoKjZyfkCRb3zVEY/pub\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Emails,</u></a> Anthony Gutierrez, consultant to Pete Gallego congressional campaign, April 2 and April 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone interview, Josh Robinson, consultant, Will Hurd campaign, Austin, April 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16f9a6LCycX42vluBe-vurVNdI9SapB5YWboqqWfvtBk/pub\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Emails</u></a>, Shana Teehan, communications director, U.S. Rep.
