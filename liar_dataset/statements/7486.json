Walker said during his Feb. 20, 2013, budget <a href=\"http://www.wiseye.org/DesktopModules/Bring2mind/DMX/Download.aspx?Command=Core_Download&amp;EntryId=473&amp;PortalId=0&amp;TabId=149\">presentation</a>. &quot;In Wisconsin, only half of all the adults with serious psychological distress received mental health treatment or medication.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the course of his remarks, Walker used two different terms -- &quot;serious mental illness&quot; and &quot;serious psychological distress.&quot; He used the second to illustrate lack of care.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs he correct that only half of Wisconsin adults with &quot;serious psychological distress&quot; receive care?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Backdrop: mass shootings</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker didn&rsquo;t mention mass shootings in his budget address, but he alluded to them two weeks earlier when he <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/gov-scott-walkers-budget-to-include-29-million-for-mental-health-b68m2f2-190027561.html\">revealed</a> his plan to boost mental health spending by $29 million over two years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.namiwisconsin.org/mission.cfm\">National Alliance on Mental Illness Wisconsin</a> praised the spending boost, which would be done from several different pots of money.But the advocacy group <a href=\"http://www.namiwisconsin.org/\">said</a> Walker&rsquo;s rejection of a federal proposal to expand Medicaid &quot;reflects a shallow understanding&quot; of &quot;crucial means to affordable mental health care for Wisconsin residents.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn revealing his plans, the governor stopped short of drawing a clear link between treating mental illness and preventing mass shootings, but indicated his plan took on greater urgency after mass killings in 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose incidents included the shooting deaths of six worshippers at a <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/oak-creek-wisconsin-sikh-temple-shooting.html\">Sikh temple</a> outside of Milwaukee and of 26 children and adults at an <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/multimedia/photos/183638921.html\">elementary school</a> in Newtown, Conn.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be clear, only about <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/law-creates-barriers-to-getting-care-for-mentally-ill-135387808.html\">1 percent</a> of people with mental illness considered to be severe are regarded as dangerous. But a 2011 <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/134341463.html\">report</a> found that this group can pose a dilemma for policy-makers, who lack the data to develop a sound system for dealing with it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s budget, which could be modified by the Legislature, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/gov-scott-walkers-budget-to-include-29-million-for-mental-health-b68m2f2-190027561.html\">includes</a> $12.6 million to treat more patients who have been committed to mental hospitals, $10.2 million to expand community-based care programs for people with severe mental illness and $3.8 million for more coordination of care for children with behavioral issues.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Walker&rsquo;s evidence</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen we asked Walker&rsquo;s office for evidence to back his claim, we were initially referred to a January 2013 <a href=\"http://scaoda.state.wi.us/docs/main/CombinedNAdraft013013.pdf\">report</a> by his Department of Health Services. The report estimated, based on a federal survey of American adults, that in 2011, 49 percent of the 1 million adults in Wisconsin who had &quot;any mental illness&quot; did not get treatment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k11MH_FindingsandDetTables/2K11MHDetTabs/NSDUH-MHDetTabsGlossary2011.htm\">Any mental illness</a> refers to people who have a &quot;diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder.&quot; The disorder causes impairment -- ranging from mild to moderate to substantial -- in carrying out major life activities.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe 49 percent figure cited in the health department&rsquo;s report might appear to support Walker&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut his claim about Wisconsin didn&rsquo;t use the term mental illness. It used the phrase &quot;serious psychological distress.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe pointed out the difference to Stephanie Smiley, spokeswoman for the department. She then cited federal <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Frequencies+Crosstabulations+--+Output.htm\">survey data</a> showing that over a two-year period -- 2010 to 2011 -- an estimated 51 percent of Wisconsin adults with &quot;serious psychological distress&quot; did not get treatment in the previous year.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(She also said that in 2008-2009, 31 percent of state adults with serious mental illness got treatment.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, the 51 percent figure about serious psychological distress appears to back Walker&rsquo;s claim.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut let&rsquo;s understand serious psychological distress as compared to serious mental illness, given that mental illness was the focus of Walker&rsquo;s comments and his proposed spending increase.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Other evidence</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBased on <a href=\"http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k11MH_FindingsandDetTables/2K11MHDetTabs/NSDUH-MHDetTabsGlossary2011.htm\">definitions</a> pertaining to adults from the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which oversees the surveys Walker cited: there are differences between serious mental illness -- the first term Walker used in his budget speech -- and serious psychological distress, which he mentioned second.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Serious mental illness</em> refers to a &quot;diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder&quot; that involves substantial impairment in carrying out major life activities.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Serious psychological distress</em> refers to how a person responds to six questions in a federal survey about whether they feel nervous, hopeless, restless or fidgety, sad or depressed, &quot;that everything was an effort&quot; and &quot;no good or worthless.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tExperts we consulted said that serious mental illness was a more precise term used to identify a person after thorough diagnosis and that serious psychological distress was an intentionally vague term used by researchers doing surveys.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;It kind of casts a wider net,&quot; Annabelle Potvin of the <a href=\"http://www.namiwisconsin.org/\">National Alliance on Mental Illness Wisconsin</a> said of the serious psychological distress term, which she said indicates a need for a person to get a mental health assessment. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSerious psychological distress can encompass people anywhere on a scale from mild to serious mental illness, but tends to be lower on the scale. That&rsquo;s according to the University of Wisconsin-Madison&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://uwphi.pophealth.wisc.edu/about/staff/connor-tim.htm\">Tim Connor</a>, who evaluates mental health programs across the state; and <a href=\"http://communityadvocates.net/about/staff_leadership/\">Walter Laux</a>, behavioral health division director of Community Advocates, a Milwaukee-based nonprofit agency.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIndeed, the state Department of Health Services, in a 2010 <a href=\"http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/hw2020/pdf/mentalhealth.pdf\">report</a>, also made a distinction.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSerious psychological distress is a &quot;non-specific category of distress&quot; characterized by a &quot;mood or anxiety disorder and a lesser degree of functional impairment than serious mental illness.&quot; It is considered to be &quot;an indicator of possible serious mental illness, with similar but less strict inclusion criteria.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn other words, people with serious psychological distress might have mental illness, but that distress is generally regarded as lower on a scale than serious mental illness.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter making a reference to serious mental illness, Walker said: &quot;In Wisconsin, only half of all the adults with serious psychological distress received mental health treatment or medication.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStrictly speaking, Walker&rsquo;s statistical claim is accurate, at least based on estimates derived from a federal survey.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut his statement needs clarification, given that people with serious psychological distress may have mental illness, but have not been diagnosed as being mentally ill.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate his statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-07T15:57:57.778475", "ruling_date": "2013-03-08T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "In wake of mass shootings, Scott Walker says half of Wisconsin adults with \"serious psychological distress\" don't get care", "ruling_headline_slug": "wake-mass-shootings-scott-walker-says-half-wiscons", "ruling_link_text": "But serious mental illness is different", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWisconsin Public Television, Gov.
