Ron Paul is courting the belly vote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring the first 2012 presidential debate in South Carolina on Thursday, the Texas Republican said the economy will cause President Barack Obama&rsquo;s re-election efforts to suffer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;My theory is that people vote from their bellies because it&rsquo;s whether they&rsquo;re hungry or not or have jobs and need things, that&rsquo;s why people vote,&quot; Paul said. &quot;And we&rsquo;re in big trouble. Prices are going up, unemployment is continuing to go up.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to check whether both prices and unemployment are rising.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s start with the former.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCheryl Abbot, an economist at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, told us that prices are almost always going up because of inflation &mdash; the question is whether prices have been increasing at a faster rate as of late.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the answer is yes. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics&rsquo; Consumer Price Index, year-over-year inflation rate has been accelerating since November 2010, when the rate was 1.1 percent. The bureau&rsquo;s most recent data is from March, when the inflation rate was 2.7 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe price spike is &quot;almost entirely due to gasoline prices,&quot; Abbot said. Take gasoline prices out of the picture, and the rate change is nominal, she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about unemployment?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlash back to January 2008, when the unemployment rate stood at a mere 5 percent. By October 2009, it was 10.1 percent. During most of 2010, unemployment hovered just below 10 percent, peaking in November at 9.8 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut since then, the rate has fallen every month, dropping to 8.8 percent in March.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUntil today, that is, when the the bureau reported that unemployment ticked up two-tenths of a point, to 9 percent, in April.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s still high by historical standards, Abbot said, but she quibbles with Paul&rsquo;s claim that unemployment &quot;continues to go up.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo do we. We have no qualms with Paul&rsquo;s price claim, but unemployment has dropped steadily for four of the last five months. And the labor bureau didn&rsquo;t report April&rsquo;s uptick until after Paul made his debate talking point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-06T17:52:09.172924", "ruling_date": "2011-05-06T17:03:43", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Rep.
