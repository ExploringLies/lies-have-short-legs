Really? Were 3,000 people were killed by guns in just one month? We decided to check it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we reached out to the Clinton campaign for evidence, they directed us to the Centers for Disease Control. In 2013 -- the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/injury.htm\">most recent CDC tally</a> -- 33,636 people died in gun incidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you divide that by 12, it comes out to 2,803 -- or nearly 3,000 people a month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Clinton was talking about 2015, not 2013. More recent data doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist. We surveyed a number of experts, and they all said the CDC is the best source on this topic. A CDC spokesman told us that 2014 data will come out in December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only alternative we could find is the <a href=\"http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/\">Gun Violence Archive</a>, which is a nonprofit organization that keeps a running tally of gun deaths <a href=\"http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/methodology\">by combing through</a> police blotters and news media, among other sources, daily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gun Violence Archive&rsquo;s numbers aren&rsquo;t comprehensive, though. In 2014, the group counted <a href=\"http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls\">12,500 gun deaths in 2014</a> and 11,500 so far in 2015 -- both less than half of what the CDC counted in 2013. This is largely because the count doesn&#39;t include suicides, which&nbsp;make up <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/24/suicides-account-for-most-gun-deaths/\">more than half</a> of all gun deaths.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The archive will receive 2015 suicide data in about six months, said Mark Bryant, the archive&#39;s executive director. He said that their total number of gun deaths could triple when that data is added in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Clinton is wrong to suggest we can know how many people died from gun injuries since the Democrats debated in Las Vegas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, we wanted to know if it was possible Clinton&rsquo;s claim is accurate for this year, so we ran her number by some experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My call is that Clinton&rsquo;s claim is not necessarily proven, but it is well in the range of possibility,&quot; said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor who studies violent crime at the University of Central Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the total for 2015 might be <em>higher </em>than 2013, as gun suicides are up, said Garen Wintemute, an expert in gun violence at the University of California Davis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Homicides are up, too, which would contribute to a higher number of gun deaths this year, Corzine noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One final note on Clinton&rsquo;s phrasing: Some could interpret her description of gun deaths -- &quot;killed by guns&quot; -- as violence inflicted upon one person by another. However, more than 60 percent of all gun deaths in 2013 were intentional suicides, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf\">according to the CDC</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said, &quot;Since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found a few problems with her statement. First, we don&rsquo;t actually know how many people have died in the last month. Clinton&rsquo;s statement is based on 2013 data from the CDC, which tallied nearly 3,000 gun deaths per month that year. There&rsquo;s not more recent data available. Experts say the number of gun deaths this year is likely to be similar to or higher than 2013, so Clinton&rsquo;s claim is probably not too far off. But we can&rsquo;t know for sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, it&rsquo;s likely that at roughly half of these deaths are due to suicide. It could be even higher. Clinton&rsquo;s phrasing obscures that point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton used very specific language even though she&rsquo;s actually extrapolating from old data. Overall, we rate her claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Editor&#39;s note: The Gun Violence Archive got back to us after publication, and we&#39;ve updated the piece to include their comments.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-17T11:58:40.176179", "ruling_date": "2015-11-17T14:49:58", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton: 3,000 killed by guns between Nevada and Iowa Democratic debates", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-3000-killed-guns-between-nevada-an", "ruling_link_text": "No data for last month", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CDC, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Deaths: Final Data for 2013,</u></a>&quot; 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gun Violence Archive, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/number-of-gun-deaths\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Number of Deaths in 2015</u></a>,&quot; accessed Nov. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin, Nov. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Garen Wintemute, physician at UC Davis, Nov. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Jay Corzine, professor at University of Central Florida, Nov. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Avery Palmer, Violence Policy Center spokesman, Nov. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, Nov. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, CDC media department, Nov. 16, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Since we last debated in Las Vegas, nearly 3,000 people have been killed by guns.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a debate in Iowa", "statement_date": "2015-11-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>We strive to make our work completely accurate.
