Here&rsquo;s why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Google Trends tells us (and doesn&rsquo;t)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google Trends launched 10 years ago as a way to allow users to track the popularity of a search item in relation to an event. The search data categorizes searches into related groups and then measures the interest in a particular topic across searches&nbsp;from around the world, right down to cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, these were the top five questions in the United Kingdom on Google Trends after the Brexit vote on June 23. The queries represent the most-searched items relating to the European Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/elZuemDOezRrlvSE4HInqKMdtZ1BkyRCOoeSSbqFVYbvJUJGtrm69_J-lqfa7F2XXtiaRUIjZVpHenaJ2RGFMlmHlKDgH9N6sU_IggwUV8_okgh43NV3l39rUP1W5JchnCWgtsA7\" style=\"border:none; height:330px; width:496px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Google Trends doesn&rsquo;t tell us is who is actually doing the searching. So there&rsquo;s no way to tell if the searches were done by Brexit voters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another issue is the significance of the searches in comparison to other factors. A 250 percent spike doesn&rsquo;t mean much if not many people were searching &quot;what happens if we leave the EU?&quot; prior to the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of searches before the vote is hard to determine</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The problem with Google Trends is that it&#39;s essentially a black box,&quot; said Pete Meyers, a marketing scientist at Moz which sells marketing analytics software subscriptions. &quot;There&#39;s a lot we don&#39;t know about what goes into the number, and everything is relative.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, when you look at &quot;What is the EU,&quot; on Google Trends, you see a spike. But when you add the term &quot;Brexit&quot; to the same graph the spike seems far less severe, he said. Although the raw totals of searches are not shown, the Trends data shows searches for&nbsp;&quot;Brexit&quot; were much higher than &quot;What is the EU?&quot; on June 24, the day after the vote. &nbsp;<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XcRwR7rh3jfGfwJmj4Cb6dSVxHtBlqf9mSgCwabL8Tr1Ri2RVu865qKdO5-TQ7JUYU1KhPyhe2pnhbNHxHDS73t-FVsoaR6ePM8_N3yogXz6tUGGMBUzPhOgIEeZZggWh5fxtFmL\" style=\"border:none; height:405px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/G0mZpOHHlBWQVyrxGQ1j0Mx-k6Z0fW5xzXncQXUwOvW4cjzQce6HbUNhiMrZyepNVN-Vi7VbkAV9a35keYziZrCJeli1He45aB0-giFyskd7ALmSBcEyQehFrHn5pl2BBKLp7T3c\" style=\"border:none; height:397px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google Trends looks at a random sample of all searches, so you don&rsquo;t see the total number of specific searches. The numbers on the chart represent a probability of how highly searched a query is, ranked from 1 to 100. This allows Google to compare two terms against one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The volume of searches can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, Meyers said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If Google reports that a lot of people are searching for &lsquo;What is the EU?&rsquo; and then the press picks it up, curiosity leads people to run similar searches to see what the fuss is about,&quot; Meyers said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said he can&rsquo;t prove that&rsquo;s what happened here, but it has happened in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another major flaw in using Google Trends to make bold pronouncements like the <em>Daily Mail</em> is that the most common way to search something is usually the term that shows up at the top, said Marti Hearst, a professor for the University of California at Berkeley&rsquo;s school of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Only the most common (and therefore the most ignorant-sounding) search queries will make it to the top,&quot; Hearst said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, nuance questions like, &quot;How does Northumberland elected representative to the EU support our interests,&quot; would not surface to the top, she said. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts agreed that the way many news outlets used the Google Trends reports is not grounded in science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The numbers shown to the public are processed in many ways and are meant to be very general trends only,&quot; Hearst said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claims that publications are making go too far, said Tom Davenport, the President&rsquo;s Distinguished Professor of Information Technology and Management at Babson College.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I might interpret the findings more positively,&quot; Davenport said. &quot;At least a lot of people have curiosity and are trying to learn more about the Brexit topic.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like other media accounts, the <em>Daily Mail</em> headline said &quot;Google search spike suggests many people don&rsquo;t know why they voted for Brexit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is misleading. It&rsquo;s impossible to say if UK voters were the ones doing these searches, and the numbers of searches are hard to determine. Relative to searches for &quot;Brexit,&quot; searches about &quot;what is the EU&quot; were far less common.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know people searched &quot;What is the EU&quot; and &quot;What will happen if we leave the EU,&quot; but we don&rsquo;t know why or how many. Point being, there&rsquo;s no evidence to fill those gaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-01T13:33:04.397019", "ruling_date": "2016-07-01T15:56:46", "ruling_headline": "What's missing from media claims linking Google Trends to Brexit vote", "ruling_headline_slug": "what-google-trends-tell-us-and-doesnt-about-brexit", "ruling_link_text": "We don't know who was searching", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Daily Mail</em>, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3657997/Britain-s-Google-searches-hint-people-didn-t-know-voting-for.html#comments\" style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">&quot;Google search spike suggests many people don&#39;t know why they voted for Brexit,&quot;</a> June 25, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/06/24/the-british-are-frantically-googling-what-the-eu-is-hours-after-voting-to-leave-it/\">&quot;The British are frantically Googling what the E.U. is, hours after voting to leave it,&quot;</a> June 24, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh0ac5HUpDU\">&quot;Brexit Update&quot;</a> via Youtube, June 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forbes, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/eliseackerman/2016/06/28/brexit-and-the-two-faces-of-google-adwords-data/#1e6bfb4dc7a0\">&quot;#BREXIT, Google Trends And The Two Faces Of Google AdWords Data,&quot;</a> June 28, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medium,<a href=\"https://medium.com/@dannypage/stop-using-google-trends-a5014dd32588#.wvqab3fub\"> &quot;Stop Using Google Trends,&quot;</a> June 24, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ringer, <a href=\"https://theringer.com/was-that-google-trends-brexit-story-legit-2df9547a285c#.bnrjr3110\">&quot;How Legit Was That Google Trends-Brexit Story?&quot;</a> June 28, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google Trends,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GoogleTrends/status/746137920940056578\"> tweet</a>, June 23, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google Trends, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/googletrends/status/746303118820937728\">tweet</a>, June 24, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Pete Meyers, Marketing Scientist for Moz, June 30, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Tom Davenport, the President&rsquo;s Distinguished Professor of Information Technology and Management at Babson College, June 30, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Marti Hearst, professor for the University of California at Berkeley&rsquo;s school of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, June 30, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Kara Berman, Google spokesperson, June 30, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Daily", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3574, "last_name": "Mail", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "daily-mail", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Screen_Shot_2016-07-01_at_1.13.32_PM_copy.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3574/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/ushome/index.html"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Google search spike suggests many people don&rsquo;t know why they voted for Brexit.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "a headline", "statement_date": "2016-06-24", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 115, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/115/", "subject": "Technology", "subject_slug": "technology", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "What Google Trends tell us (and doesn't) about Brexit vote"}
