Asked later to repeat himself, Martinez said in a voice-mail message: &quot;I think we&rsquo;ve had four Latinos in the designated &lsquo;gentlemen&rsquo;s agreement&rsquo; seat&quot; on the council,&quot; plus, he said, another council member who says he was Latino, the late Robert Barnstone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That would be five total,&quot; Martinez said, adding he speculated at the event that up to five Hispanic residents could be elevated to the council all at once in the November elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the first time, voters are poised to fill 10 council seats from within geographic districts with the mayor&rsquo;s job filled, as before, by citywide balloting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And has Austin, which was <a href=\"http://www.austinlibrary.com/ahc/faq1.htm\"><u>incorporated in 1839</u></a>, only had a few Hispanic council members?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News organizations including the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em> have noted the &quot;gentlemen&rsquo;s agreement&quot; mentioned by Martinez as explaining why the seven-member council, elected citywide, has rarely had more than a black and an Hispanic member. Under the so-called agreement, certain seats on the council were seen among many as reserved for members of those minority groups to seek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results: A <a href=\"http://austintexas.gov/department/city-council/about\"><u>&quot;Milestones&quot; web page</u></a> created by the city says John Trevi&ntilde;o was the first Hispanic citizen elected to the council; he won Place 5 on May 3, 1975. Voters had made Beryl Handcox the council&rsquo;s first African American in May 1971, according to the page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Aug. 20, 2010, <em>Statesman</em> <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/mexican-american-trailblazers-recognized-by-austin/nRxBj/\"><u>news feature story</u></a> on local Mexican American pioneers called Trevi&ntilde;o the first Hispanic on the council and further said Gus Garcia, a former Austin school board trustee, later won election to the council before winning election in 2000 as mayor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Garcia, who like Trevi&ntilde;o initially won Place 5 on the council, said Trevi&ntilde;o and Richard Moya, the first Mexican American elected to the Travis County Commissioners Court, were &quot;young Turks&quot; who sought to break free from a long-standing system in which a handful of Hispanic leaders and businessmen had access to Anglo leaders, the story said. &quot;We wanted to make it more democratic,&quot; Garcia said then. &quot;None of us thought about doing this so we could be recognized. We did it because there was a need in the (Mexican American) community.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To our request for detail, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean guided us to the Austin History Center where researcher Jeff Carrillo pointed out city election results through history, <a href=\"http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/election/search.cfm\"><u>posted online</u></a>.

Alvarez was re-elected in 2003 but didn&rsquo;t seek another term in 2006, when Martinez initially won the seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This leaves Barnstone, who succeeded Trevi&ntilde;o in Place 5 in 1988.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Garcia, asked for his recollections, told us by email that in Austin&rsquo;s Mexican-American community, Barnstone wasn&rsquo;t considered &quot;one of us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, the center&rsquo;s Molly Hults pointed out Barnstone&rsquo;s June 25, 2008, <em>Statesman</em> paid<a href=\"http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/statesman/obituary.aspx?pid=112223713\"> <u>obituary</u></a> stating Barnstone grew up in Laredo as part of a &quot;legendary Texas and Mexican family.&quot; At the time, the <em>Statesman</em>&rsquo;s front-page news story on Barnstone&rsquo;s passing described him as a charismatic developer and &quot;campaigner who never failed to use his fluent Spanish on the trail - his mother, born in Veracruz, Mexico, raised him; his Anglo father died before Barnstone was born.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martinez said there have been four or maybe five Hispanic council members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;d say five.
