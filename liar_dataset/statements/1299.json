Here, we're looking only at the statement, \"Page 110 - Section 222(e) requires the use of federal dollars to fund abortions through the government-run health plan.\"\n <br />\n <br />\n We should emphasize that the House bill has yet to be voted on, and Democratic leaders have said they might consider new language on how the bill handles abortion. The Senate is expected to consider its own bill with details that diverge somewhat from the House.\n</p>\n<p>\n The latest version of the House bill incorporates an amendment proposed by Rep. Lois Capps, a Democrat from California. Her proposal sought to create a compromise on abortion, especially in regards to the public option, a basic insurance plan run by the government and offered as a choice on the health insurance exchange.\n</p>\n<p>\n The public option could offer abortion services, but if it does, those services would be paid for with segregated patient premiums, not public subsidies. We looked at\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/07/john-boehner/boehner-says-democrats-health-care-plan-would-lead/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  the Capps amendment\n </a>\n is some detail previously. We concluded that the Capps amendment would stop tax dollars from subsidizing abortion.\n</p>\n<p>\n The sticking point in the new Republican claim, though, is the term \"federal dollars.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n If you consider federal dollars to be tax revenues, then the public option would not pay for abortion, because patient premiums will pay for abortion.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the other hand, if you consider \"federal dollars\" to be any money handled by a federal agency, then the public option would pay for abortion.\n</p>\n<p>\n We've concluded before that if millions of uninsured people would now get insurance due to the health care plan, and some of the plans offer abortion coverage, we think it's fair to conclude that means more women would have access to abortion services.
