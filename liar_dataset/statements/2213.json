So it&rsquo;s no surprise Ohio Treasurer Kevin Boyce, who is running in November to keep his job, is bragging about cutting his salary.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoyce talked about his six-figure earnings in a YouTube video released by his office. Presented as a preview of the office&rsquo;s forthcoming annual financial report, the production feels more like a tribute to Boyce&rsquo;s performance as treasurer aimed directly at voters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I&rsquo;ve even cut my salary -- twice,&quot; said Boyce, a Democrat and former Columbus city councilman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoyce was appointed Treasurer in late 2008. Richard Cordray left a vacancy when he took the state attorney general&rsquo;s job in the wake of Marc Dann&rsquo;s resignation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnnual salaries for the state&rsquo;s elected officials are set in state law, which lawmakers can amend to increase or decrease pay. The treasurer&rsquo;s salary has been set at $109,986 since 2008.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn June 2009, Boyce sent a memo to the state Department of Administrative Services saying he was taking a pay cut that would reduce his gross salary that year to $107,874. The pay cut, effective July 1, 2009, was the equivalent of taking five unpaid furlough days, a cost-saving measure that has been forced upon many state employees.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the same memo, Boyce authorized an extension of the reduction for all of 2010. This year&rsquo;s pay cut is the equivalent of 10 unpaid furlough days, according to the administrative services department.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoyce&rsquo;s gross salary this year will be $105,757.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoyce lumped both cuts -- each about 2 percent -- in the same memo, but he effectively trimmed his salary twice. Had he not extended the cut into 2010, his pay would&rsquo;ve jumped back up to $109,986, a spokeswoman for the administrative services department said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe find Boyce&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/08/ohio_treasurer_kevin_boyce_twi.html\">Comment on this item</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-11T11:05:06.613591", "ruling_date": "2010-08-11T11:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ohio Treasurer Kevin Boyce twice cut his own pay ", "ruling_headline_slug": "ohio-treasurer-kevin-boyce-twice-cut-his-own-pay", "ruling_link_text": "Annual pay still has six digits", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tYouTube, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP2JlOkjMNQ\">Boyce Uses Innovation to Reveal Fiscal Year End Accomplishments for Ohioans</a>, posted July 14, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKevin Boyce, <a href=\"http://blog.cleveland.com/pdextra/2010/08/letter_carries_state_treasurer.html\">letter to the Ohio Department of Administrative Services</a>, June, 26, 2009</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Ohio treasurer", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Kevin", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 586, "last_name": "Boyce", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "kevin-boyce", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifactohio-kevin-boyce.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/586/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.tos.ohio.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;I&rsquo;ve even cut my own salary -- twice.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign video", "statement_date": "2010-07-14", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 131, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/131/", "subject": "Government Efficiency", "subject_slug": "government-efficiency", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 157, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/157/", "subject": "Message Machine 2010", "subject_slug": "message-machine", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
