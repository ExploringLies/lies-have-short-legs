The article said the tax would be paid by oil companies and gradually phased in over five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be clear, the article said the proposal &quot;isn&rsquo;t expected to go far.&quot; And in a <a href=\"http://www.speaker.gov/general/10-oil-tax\">news release</a> Ryan issued the same day as his tweet, he said the tax is &quot;dead on arrival in Congress.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MarketWatch article quoted Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com, as saying: &quot;This proposal would trickle down and be a $10 per barrel tax on motorists -- or 20 to 25 cents per gallon on refined fuels. To me it&rsquo;s clear: this is not something oil companies are going to absorb.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, 24 cents is in the range of the analyst&rsquo;s estimate. But it&rsquo;s only one analyst; and his estimate is based on how he thinks oil companies would respond to a $10-per-barrel tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the oil companies would do isn&rsquo;t quite as certain as what Ryan claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A trade group that should know, the American Petroleum Institute, <a href=\"http://www.api.org/news-policy-and-issues/news/2016/02/04/api-new-oil-tax-proposal-would-harm-cons\">warned the tax</a> would &quot;harm consumers.&quot; But it hedged a bit in saying the tax &quot;could&quot; raise the cost of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economist Nicolas Loris estimated the cost slightly lower, at <a href=\"http://dailysignal.com/2016/02/05/obamas-new-oil-tax-would-hike-up-gas-prices-22-cents-a-gallon/\">22 cents</a>, the <em>Huffington Post</em> said <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamas-oil-tax-would-be-good-for-america_us_56b4c8f6e4b04f9b57d94adf\">22 to 24 cents</a>, and the <em>Washington Post</em> said <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-to-propose-10-a-barrel-oil-tax-to-fund-rail-and-highway-projects/2016/02/04/49b3ec5c-cb7f-11e5-88ff-e2d1b4289c2f_story.html\">24 cents</a>. <em><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/02/obama-oil-tax-budget-000038\">Politico</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2016/02/09/with-fuel-prices-low-president-obama-floats-10-per-barrel-tax-on-oil/#5b72671f42b0\">Forbes</a></em> said about 25 cents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One note: The federal government currently imposes a tax of <a href=\"https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/gastax.cfm\">18.4 cents</a> per gallon of gasoline. But that&rsquo;s a direct tax on gas, not on the oil companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan said: &quot;President Obama&rsquo;s proposed oil tax would cost consumers 24 cents a gallon.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estimates are in the 24 cents range for the $10-per-barrel tax that Obama proposed on oil companies.
