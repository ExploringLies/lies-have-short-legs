People are -- at least $10, but it has to go up. But I think that states -- federal -- I think that states should really call the shot. As an example, I live in New York. It&#39;s very expensive in New York. You can&#39;t buy a hot dog for the money you&#39;re talking about. You go to other states and it&#39;s not expensive at all. Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up, companies move out and things, bad things happen. At the same time, people have to be taken care of. But what I&#39;m really going to do on the minimum wage -- but it has to go up.. .. So I would like to raise it to at least $10.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A journalist then followed up, &quot;You said we need to raise it to $10. &hellip; Are you talking about the federal minimum wage?&quot; Trump confirmed, &quot;Federal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some saw the Florida remarks as a change to Trump&rsquo;s previous position on whether there should be a federal minimum wage floor for the entire country. Were they?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we go any further, let&rsquo;s recap how the minimum wage works in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a federal minimum wage -- currently $7.25 -- that serves as a floor beneath which no state&rsquo;s minimum wage can fall. Any states, however, can set their minimum wage level higher than $7.25. (There are exceptions to the $7.25 minimum wage level for some workers, such as those who survive heavily on tips.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clearest counterpoint to Trump&rsquo;s Florida comments came from an interview on NBC&rsquo;s <em>Meet the Press</em> on May 8. We cited this exchange in our July 8 fact check, in which we gave a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2016/jul/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-wants-get-rid-federal/\">True</a> rating to an assertion by Hillary Clinton that Trump &quot;wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the fact-check, we noted that Trump told NBC&rsquo;s Chuck Todd that he preferred that states -- not the federal government -- act on their own to raise the minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I would like to see an increase of some magnitude,&quot; Trump told Todd. &quot;But I&#39;d rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don&#39;t forget, the states have to compete with each other.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Todd asked specifically, &quot;Should the federal government set a floor&quot; for the minimum wage?&quot; Trump replied, &quot;No. I&#39;d rather have the states go out and do what they have to do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, fast-forward nearly three months to Trump&rsquo;s Florida news conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His comments at the news conference seemed to embrace a national rise in the minimum wage -- specifically, he said, &quot;The minimum wage has to go up. ... at least $10, but it has to go up.&quot; And he clarified that that meant, &quot;federal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a clearer commitment to hiking the minimum wage for every American than Trump had made in his comments to Todd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, though, Trump also said, &quot;I think that states should really call the shot.&quot; This essentially kept Trump&rsquo;s focus on the states acting on their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s apparent advocacy for a national $10 minimum wage in his Florida comments does go further than some of his other prior statements on the issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; In an interview with <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-having-a-low-minimum-wage-is-not-a-bad-thing-2015-8\">MSNBC</a> in August 2015, Trump said, &quot;Having a low minimum wage is not a bad thing for this country.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; During the <a href=\"http://time.com/4107636/transcript-read-the-full-text-of-the-fourth-republican-debate-in-milwaukee/\">Republican debate</a> in Milwaukee in November 2015, Trump said wages are &quot;too high&quot; and, when asked whether he would raise the minimum wage, said, &quot;I would not do it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; On ABC&rsquo;s This Week on <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-donald-trump/story?id=38951757\">May 8, 2016</a>, host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump, &quot;Minimum wage -- all through the primaries, you were against an increase. Now you&#39;re saying you&#39;re looking at it. So what&#39;s your bottom line on this?&quot; Trump responded, &quot;Well, I am looking at it and I haven&#39;t decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more.&quot; When Stephanopoulos asked whether that&rsquo;s a change, Trump answered, &quot;Well, sure it&#39;s a change. I&#39;m allowed to change. You need flexibility.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A final note: Trump&rsquo;s most recent comments on the issue were a brief exchange in a longer press conference. It&rsquo;s possible he may adjust his views again in the future. Trump&rsquo;s press office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the question of whether the federal government should set a minimum wage, Trump seems to have made a shift between his <em>Meet the Press</em> comments and his Florida news conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <em>Meet the Press </em>interview, Trump explicitly said he doesn&rsquo;t want the federal government raising, or even setting, the minimum wage floor. By contrast, in the Florida news conference, he said the &quot;federal&quot; minimum wage &quot;has to go up.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump emphasized in both instances that he prefers the states to raise their minimum wages on their own, so it&rsquo;s fair to say that Trump is sending conflicting messages. Still, his contrast on the question of a federal minimum wage hike is pretty stark. We rate this a Full Flop.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/af3a5b62-19a8-4b79-b8cb-dc2cfe6ee0c2\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/af3a5b62-19a8-4b79-b8cb-dc2cfe6ee0c2</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-28T18:04:13.834005", "ruling_date": "2016-07-28T18:39:48", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump gets a Full Flop for stance on minimum wage", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-gets-full-flop-stance-minimum-wage", "ruling_link_text": "He's had many stances on the minimum wage", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/27/donald-trumps-falsehood-laden-press-conference-annotated/\">transcript of Donald Trump press conference</a>, July 27, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-07-27/trump-s-minimum-wage-reversal-is-latest-headache-for-republicans?utm_content=politics&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-politics\">Trump&rsquo;s Minimum-Wage Reversal Is Latest Headache for Republicans</a>,&quot; July 27, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/26/bernie-s/sanders-trump-would-allow-states-lower-minimum-wag/\">Sanders: Trump would allow states to lower the minimum wage</a>,&quot; July 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact North Carolina, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2016/jul/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-wants-get-rid-federal/\">Hillary Clinton: Donald Trump wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage</a>,&quot; July 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/may/11/trying-pin-down-what-donald-trump-thinks-about-abo/\">Trying to pin down what Donald Trump thinks about abortion, the minimum wage, taxes, and U.S. debt</a>,&quot; May 11, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>On whether the federal government should set a minimum wage</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a news conference", "statement_date": "2016-07-27", "statement_type": {"id": 4, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/4/", "statement_type": "Flip", "type_description": "Flip-o-Meter items"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 103, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/103/", "subject": "Workers", "subject_slug": "workers", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Donald Trump flip-flops on a national minimum wage"}
