The figure, which doesn&#39;t include suicides or accidents, is from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut more recent figures from the CDC, which tracks the causes of deaths for U.S. residents, had been released in September 2012. The newer figures show that, for 2006 through 2010, the five-year rolling average for gun homicides dropped to 33.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2010 alone, there were 31,672 gun-related deaths, including 19,392 suicides and 11,078 homicides. The remaining deaths were classified as unintentional (606), undetermined (252), or legal intervention/war (344).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey also pointed out that, on an annual basis, the gun homicide figure is dropping. An average of 30 people were killed in 2010 and the preliminary figure for 2011 is also 30.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&#39;s down from the average of 35 in 2006, the highest year of the decade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tErika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for Demand a Plan, told us the number of gun homicides might be declining because of improvements in medical care have resulted in more lives being saved.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe cited a December 2012 news article in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. The article said that the number of people shot in the U.S. is increasing, but the percentage who die is decreasing.
