Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, on his Dec. 16, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday-chris-wallace/2012/12/16/connecticut-school-shooting-reignites-gun-control-debate#p//v/2039381272001\">show</a>, two days after the Newtown, Conn., <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/nyregion/newtown-mourns-last-of-its-children-killed-in-massacre.html?_r=0\">elementary school massacre</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGohmert answered in part, &quot;For the reason George Washington said a free people should be an armed people. It ensures against the tyranny of the government.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted spokeswomen for Gohmert, seeking details on the Washington quotation, but didn&rsquo;t hear back.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut a Web search led us to a similar statement that Washington made in the <a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29431\">first State of the Union address</a>, Jan. 8, 1790: &quot;A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExperts told us, though, that Washington was calling for a trained militia to defend the new nation, not anticipating a citizens&rsquo; stand against their own government&rsquo;s tyranny.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statement comes near the beginning of Washington&rsquo;s speech:<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 36pt;margin-right: 40.5pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tAmong the interesting objects, which will engage your attention, that of providing for the common defence will merit particular regard.

The <a href=\"http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/documents/union/reply1.html#senate\">Senate</a> and <a href=\"http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/documents/union/reply1.html#house\">House</a> both issued formal responses, Woolley said, and &quot;there is no hint in either of these that the members of Congress thought there was something in that speech about gun rights.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWashington&rsquo;s address goes on to say that peaceful measures having failed in regards to &quot;certain tribes of hostile Indians&quot; on the southern and western frontiers, &quot;we ought to be prepared to afford protection to those parts of the Union.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe &quot;common defence,&quot; being prepared for war and having the ability to protect against hostile tribes all refer to outside threats.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEdward Lengel, editor in chief of the <a href=\"http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/\">Papers of George Washington</a> project at the University of Virginia, told us by email, &quot;Washington never said, to my knowledge, anything about arms providing a safeguard against any so-called &lsquo;tyranny&rsquo; of government.&rsquo; &quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn reading the &quot;armed, but disciplined&quot; quotation, Lengel said, &quot;emphasis should be on the word &lsquo;disciplined,&rsquo; by which Washington was taking a backhanded swipe at the militia, which he considered undisciplined and next to useless in combat. Washington was all for an ordered, professional standing army under the command of a strong central government.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut an army was expensive, as Washington wrote in a <a href=\"http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_12s6.html\">May 2, 1783, memo</a> to a congressional committee that <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/georgewashington/collection/war_1783apr9.html\">asked for his advice</a> on how to organize the military in peacetime.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We are too poor to maintain a standing Army adequate to our defence,&quot; he said, and suggested a small regular army supplemented by a well-organized militia -- a part-time force of volunteers, called up in emergencies. The <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/06/26/george-washingtons-individual-mandates/\">Militia Acts of 1792</a> tracked with the memo&rsquo;s description, calling for white men 18 to 45 years old to be enrolled in a militia. A cost-cutting provision required them to provide their own arms and ammunition.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo there&rsquo;s evidence that post-Revolutionary lawmakers expected citizens to own firearms. And, Woolley said, some leaders then undoubtedly &quot;endorsed views like those Mr. Gohmert expresses -- perhaps more precisely, in order to stay free, the people should have the right to be armed.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWashington, though, does not appear to have been among them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLengel said, &quot;The idea of resistance to tyranny being dependent on a nation of gun-wielding individuals acting at their own behest or even on local initiative would have been anathema to Washington.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Indeed, during the (Revolutionary) war he very frequently lamented the crimes carried out by armed civilians or undisciplined militia against their unarmed neighbors. The solution to these crimes, as he understood it, was to increase the power of the government and the army to prevent and punish them -- not to put more guns in the hands of civilians.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMary Thompson, research historian at Washington&rsquo;s Virginia home, <a href=\"http://www.mountvernon.org/educational-resources\">Mount Vernon</a>, told us via email, &quot;Washington&rsquo;s actual quote is in regard to the people serving in the militia as an arm of the government,&quot; rather than as an armed resistance to government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, she said, Washington called up militias to put down just such a rebellion a few years later.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/duel/peopleevents/pande22.html\">Whiskey Rebellion</a> in 1794, she said, &quot;citizens of Western Pennsylvania rose up to fight a new tax on the whiskey they produced.&quot; Washington was &quot;concerned that success by the rebels would lead to a diminishment of the central/federal government,&quot; and <a href=\"http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/detail/3458\">directed state militias</a> to counter the insurrection -- &quot;citizen-soldiers,&quot; she said, &quot;acting on behalf of the government against their fellow citizens.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGohmert&rsquo;s rendering, &quot;George Washington said a free people should be an armed people,&quot; seemingly tracks Washington&rsquo;s words to the nation: &quot;A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tContrary to Gohmert&rsquo;s characterization, though, Washington was not speaking about citizens arming themselves in case of government tyranny. Quite the opposite: The president and former general was calling for disciplined troops to fight on behalf of the government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGohmert&rsquo;s statement is False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-01-03T16:48:12.039789", "ruling_date": "2013-01-03T15:47:16", "ruling_headline": "Louie Gohmert says George Washington said a free people should be armed to guard against government tyranny", "ruling_headline_slug": "louie-gohmert-says-george-washington-said-free-peo", "ruling_link_text": "Father of country stressed threats to the nation", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday-chris-wallace/2012/12/16/connecticut-school-shooting-reignites-gun-control-debate#p//v/2039381272001\">interview</a> with U.S. Rep.
