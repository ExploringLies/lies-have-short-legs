and up to $160,000 &ndash; a year to afford skyline views without spending more than 30 percent of your income on a (fancy) roof over your head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and Census Bureau both consider those who pay more than that to be &quot;cost burdened,&quot; since they may have difficulty paying for other necessities such as food and medical care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Housing advocates, including Atlanta Progressive News CEO Matthew Charles Cardinale, worry that those people are getting lost in the newly energized Atlanta housing market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tens of thousands of Atlanta households are cost-burdened, meaning they pay more than 30 percent of their income towards rent,&quot; Cardinale <a href=\"http://saportareport.com/affordable-housing-impact-statements-could-guide-policy-in-atlanta/\">recently wrote in the Saporta Report</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This includes more than 25,000 cost-burdened renter households subsisting on $20,000 or less per year,&quot; he continued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a market of gleaming new developments targeting high-end renters, do that many people needed less pricey options?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Georgia decided to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Housing in Atlanta</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to Cardinale to ask his source, and he pointed us to a 2015 update of last year&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.investatlanta.com/wp-content/uploads/Housing%20Strategy%20Final%202015.pdf\">Atlanta&rsquo;s housing strategy report</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A chart on page 10 of the report, shows about 27,000 households that make $20,000 or less and another 13,000 households with incomes between $20,000 and $35,000 spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cardinale said that shows the city&rsquo;s own data back up his proposal, to require new developments list how much of their complexes will be at or below 30 percent of the city&rsquo;s median income, as well as how many will fall between 30 and 50 percent, between 50 and 80 percent and more than 80 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It would basically be an affordable housing scorecard, not requiring projects to include affordable housing but to provide information on what&rsquo;s being done,&quot; Cardinale said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recommendation has been pending in a City Council committee since November. Yet Mayor Kasim Reed has, under the housing strategy, <a href=\"http://www.myajc.com/news/news/opinion/atlanta-aims-to-lead-in-affordable-housing/nmTwG/\">pledged to cut by 10 percent </a>the number of residents who are cost burdened on rent by 2020, according to an opinion piece this summer by his deputy planning commissioner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Census estimates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city may have its work cut out for it on that front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To verify the strategy report, we looked at the Census data cited in the chart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t\">2012 American Community Survey estimates</a> that of 103,219 households in Atlanta in 2012, 50,509 of them spent 30 percent or more of their income on housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s 49 percent of city households &ndash; and 10,000 more than plotted in the city&rsquo;s chart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t\">survey for 2014</a>, released just last week, isn&rsquo;t even that rosy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of 105,999 households now estimated in the city, 52,787 of them paid more than 30 percent of their income on rent in the past 12 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s just a hair under half of households.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only improvement? Those scrambling the most to keep up with rent &ndash; households spending more than 50 percent of their income on housing &ndash; dipped by 574 households, to 27,100 in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a full percentage drop &ndash; but still 26 percent out of city households.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How does Atlanta stack up?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For context, PolitiFact Georgia tried to find out if one out of every four households spending half of their income for a place to sleep was unusual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, not really.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renters are on the rise in the 11 most populous American metro areas, Atlanta included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A May <a href=\"http://furmancenter.org/files/CapOneNYUFurmanCenter__NationalRentalLandscape_MAY2015.pdf\">report by New York University&#39;s Furman Center</a>, which studies real estate and urban policy, and Capital One bank, found each of those cities saw the amount of rental housing grow faster than any increase in owner-occupied homes in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet despite that growth, renters everywhere struggled to keep up with increasing rents and shrinking vacancies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atlanta, for instance, saw the vacancy rate drop from 16 percent to 9.9 percent between 2006 and 2013. Median monthly rents, meanwhile, jumped 8 percent in that period, from $888 to $963.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in Atlanta and the other 10 cities, more than three out of every five low-income renters were severely rent burdened &ndash; paying more than half of their income on rent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A left-leaning housing advocate championed a scorecard of new housing development in Atlanta by claiming that &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of households in the city paid more than 30 percent of their income on rent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They do, whether looking at the city&rsquo;s housing strategy plan or the 2012 U.S. Census estimates that shaped the report. By 2014, those estimates had grown even worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, Matthew Charles Cardinale would have been on target with an even more dramatic claim: More than a quarter of Atlanta households spent more than half of their incomes on housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atlanta faces the same challenges as other large cities in serving a growing rental population. To do so will require the right data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Cardinale hits the mark with his claim about affordable housing in Atlanta. We rate his claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-09-24T14:16:07.417713", "ruling_date": "2015-09-25T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Claim about Atlanta's affordable housing hits the mark", "ruling_headline_slug": "claim-about-atlantas-affordable-housing-hits-mark", "ruling_link_text": "Just under half of city households spend 30 percent of their income on housing", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Saporta Report, &quot;<a href=\"http://saportareport.com/affordable-housing-impact-statements-could-guide-policy-in-atlanta/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Affordable Housing Impact Statements could guide policy in Atlanta,</u></a>&quot; Sept. 13, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Atlanta Journal Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.myajc.com/news/news/opinion/atlanta-aims-to-lead-in-affordable-housing/nmTwG\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Atlanta aims to lead in affordable housing,</u></a>&quot; June 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Invest Atlanta, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.investatlanta.com/wp-content/uploads/Housing%20Strategy%20Final%202015.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>A housing strategy for the City of Atlanta,</u></a>&quot; 2015 Update</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder Tables, <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>American Community Survey 1-year estimates 2012 and 2014</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York University&#39;s Furman Center and Capital One, &quot;<a href=\"http://furmancenter.org/files/CapOneNYUFurmanCenter__NationalRentalLandscape_MAY2015.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Renting in America&rsquo;s largest cities,</u></a>&quot; May 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, <a href=\"http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/comm_planning/affordablehousing/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Affordable housing</u></a>, accessed Sept. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/housing/census/publications/who-can-afford.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Who can afford to live in a home?
