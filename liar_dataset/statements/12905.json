He has even vowed to force the Mexican government to pay for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But did Clinton once back a wall?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is how Trump phrased it in his Aug. 5, 2016 rally at the KI Convention Center:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re gonna have strong borders. We&rsquo;re gonna have a wall -- a big, powerful wall. You know that Hillary Clinton wanted a wall, a number of years ago. She wanted a wall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Secure Fence Act </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, both Trump and Clinton say they support secure borders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 campaign, Trump has said he would secure borders by <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/pay-for-the-wall\">building a wall</a>. Clinton hasn&rsquo;t detailed specific plans but <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/immigration-reform/\">has said</a> she will protect U.S. borders through a combination of efforts, one being physical barriers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this factcheck is not about Clinton&rsquo;s current platform. Rather, it is about what she may have supported in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked for backup, Trump&rsquo;s campaign pointed to a 2006 bill that Clinton voted for while a senator from New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill -- the <a href=\"https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/10/20061026-1.html\">Secure Fence Act of 2006</a> -- authorized about 700 miles of fencing to be installed along the country&rsquo;s southern border, along with other security measures. It was the beginning of an attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original bill specifically called for double-layer fencing across 700 miles of the border. Clinton, and 25 other Democratic senators, voted in favor of the bill. It passed the Senate 80-19 and was signed into law by President George W. Bush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it&rsquo;s fair to say she once supported a barrier along a large portion of the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, 702 miles of fencing separates the United States from Mexico, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. But just 36 miles are double-layered. That&rsquo;s because a 2007 amendment in the federal budget bill let the U.S. Department of Homeland Security determine what was necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wall vs. fence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump campaign adviser Stephen Miller said of Clinton: &quot;Her vote is self-explanatory.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Practically speaking, what&rsquo;s the difference between Trump&rsquo;s wall and the fence proposed in 2006?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Television news anchor Jorge Ramos <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE8DD6q6EF0\">asked Clinton this question</a> Jan. 11, 2016 at the Iowa Black and Brown Forum, broadcast on the Fusion network, a Hispanic news channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What the difference between your idea and Donald Trump&rsquo;s idea on building a wall with Mexico?,&quot; Ramos asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So we do need to have secure borders and what that will take is a combination of technology and physical barrier,&quot; Clinton said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You want a wall then,&quot; Ramos interjected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No, we&rsquo;ve --&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You said that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, I voted for border security and some of it was a fence,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;I don&rsquo;t think we ever called it a wall. Maybe in some places it was a wall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute said the semantic differences are irrelevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Whether it&rsquo;s a wall or a fence, it blocks people,&quot; Nowrasteh said. &quot;Quibbling between a wall and fence -- it&rsquo;s just a word game at that point.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He noted a 700-mile barrier is substantial. Indeed, it represents about one-third of the length of the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Maybe it&rsquo;s fair to say she doesn&rsquo;t support a wall along the entirety but she certainly supported a barrier along a large portion of it,&quot; Nowrasteh said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jon Feere, a legal policy analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies, agreed. The center favors reduced immigration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s clear that, at one point, Clinton supported a secure border that includes physical barriers,&quot; Feere said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Green Bay speech, Trump said &quot;Hillary Clinton wanted a wall.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton did vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. For our purposes, the differences between a wall and a fence in this claim are not significant -- both block people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the fence Clinton backed is not nearly as expansive as the wall Trump is promoting. And in his phrasing, Trump seemed to equate the two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate Trump&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/eb1bee6a-2961-40be-ba2f-877183cc7bc4\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/eb1bee6a-2961-40be-ba2f-877183cc7bc4</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-12T21:49:47.919975", "ruling_date": "2016-08-15T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Is Donald Trump right that Hillary Clinton once \u201cwanted a wall\u201d on the Mexican border?", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-right-hillary-clinton-once-wanted-wal", "ruling_link_text": "A fence is a barrier, too", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Phone interview with Alex Nowrasteh, Immigration policy analyst, Cato Institute, August 9, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Jon Feere, Legal policy analyst, Center for Immigration Studies, August, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Stephen Miller, policy adviser, Donald Trump campaign, August 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone and email exchange with Gillian Drummond, communications director, Hillary for Wisconsin, August, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Carlos A.
