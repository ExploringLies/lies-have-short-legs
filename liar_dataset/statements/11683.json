Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul&rsquo;s amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul&rsquo;s 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio&rsquo;s campaign pointed to Paul&rsquo;s statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,&quot; Paul wrote. &quot;It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under <a href=\"http://www.paul.senate.gov/files/documents/MASTERBUDGET.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Paul&rsquo;s proposal</u></a>, defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Was Paul&rsquo;s proposal a &lsquo;cut&rsquo; for defense?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why did Rubio refer to Paul&rsquo;s budget as a &quot;cut&quot; if defense spending would rise?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,&quot; Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul&rsquo;s proposal a &quot;cut.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Paul&rsquo;s defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president&rsquo;s budget was an even larger increase),&quot; said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. &quot;But Paul&rsquo;s defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul&rsquo;s 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama&rsquo;s request both at the time and now, Harrison said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul&rsquo;s budget a &quot;cut.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,&quot; he said. &quot;This is misleading.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a &lsquo;cut&rsquo; when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,&quot; Phillips said. &quot;The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/ted-cruz-marco-rubio-rand-paul-senate-pentagon-budget-116434\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Cruz&rsquo;s vote in March</u></a> in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul&rsquo;s amendment which would have boosted it with offsets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This was a budget, so it doesn&rsquo;t make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,&quot; Friedman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said that the only budget Cruz &quot;ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio was referring to Cruz&rsquo;s vote in favor of Paul&rsquo;s budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul&rsquo;s plan when he called it a &quot;cut.&quot; That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there is a kernel of truth here in that Paul&rsquo;s proposal for defense was below Obama&rsquo;s request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-12-15T14:54:34.138954", "ruling_date": "2015-12-22T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Marco Rubio says Ted Cruz voted for defense cuts in Rand Paul's budget proposal", "ruling_headline_slug": "marco-rubio-says-ted-cruz-voted-defense-cuts-rand-", "ruling_link_text": "It's misleading to call this a cut", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Meet the Press, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NC8JmyqSQI\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Interview with Sen.
