Richard Codey claims he paid the bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCodey addressed his record of making pension payments during a Jan. 16 interview on WOR-AM with former New York Gov. David Paterson. A caller from New Jersey noted how the &quot;pension funds have not been funded from both sides&quot; over the last 11 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCodey (D-Essex) explained how state regulations now require the governor to make significant payments, and then added: &quot;And by the way, when I was governor, I did make the payment into the pension fund.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey found that Codey made a pension payment -- but it was far from the total amount recommended at the time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCodey, who served as governor between November 2004 and January 2006, was only responsible for putting together the fiscal year 2006 budget. In that fiscal year, the state made a total of about $164 million worth of payments to six pension funds, according to data provided by Bill Quinn, a spokesman for the state Department of the Treasury.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in fiscal year 2006, the total combined payment recommended by actuaries to be made to those six funds was roughly $1.45 billion, according to Quinn. So, the state only covered about 11.3 percent of the recommended payments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose payments were authorized by Codey through the fiscal year 2006 budget, but they were technically made under Codey&rsquo;s successor, Jon Corzine.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a phone interview, Codey acknowledged he made a partial payment and argued he never said he made a full payment. When we told him his statement referred to making &quot;the payment,&quot; the former governor suggested we were nitpicking.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I said I made a payment into the pension fund,&quot; Codey told us. &quot;I did make a payment and that&rsquo;s true. What I said was true.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked why he didn&rsquo;t make the full payment, Codey pointed to the $4 billion budget cap he had to grapple with. &quot;It is what it is. There&rsquo;s demands all over the place. You&rsquo;ve got to make those kind of decisions.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a radio interview, Codey claimed, &quot;when I was governor, I did make the payment into the pension fund.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s true that the state made a partial payment during fiscal year 2006, whose budget Codey had developed. But the state didn&rsquo;t make &quot;the payment&quot; in total that was recommended at the time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement Mostly True.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this story, go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/01/politifact_new_jersey_codey_cl.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-19T17:11:57.699417", "ruling_date": "2012-01-23T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Richard Codey claims he made pension payment when he was governor", "ruling_headline_slug": "richard-codey-claims-he-made-pension-payment-when-", "ruling_link_text": "A payment, not \u2018the payment\u2019", "ruling_state": "New Jersey", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://wor710.com/pages/11652104.php\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.10978074148771633\">Interview with state Sen.
