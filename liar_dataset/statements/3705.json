He dubbed them dubbed &quot;dropout factories.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn even greater share of the nation&rsquo;s minority dropouts came from these schools: 81 percent of Native Americans; 73 percent of African-Americans and 66 percent of Latinos. They were attended by 34 percent of the white dropouts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott accurately characterized the numbers in the report. But the study is several years old and we wanted to take an updated look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBalfanz re-examined the issue with other researchers in a 2010 report titled &quot;Building a Grad Nation.&quot; Using U.S. Department of Education figures, the authors found the number of the country&rsquo;s worst-performing schools had fallen from 2,007 in 2002 to 1,746 in 2008.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe study was co-sponsored by the America&rsquo;s Promise Alliance. Co-founded by retired Army General and Secretary of State Colin Powell, the non-profit group has proposed a &quot;Civic Marshall Plan&quot; to increase the number of students completing high school.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA March 2011 update of the &quot;Building a Grad Nation&quot; study found that in 2009, the latest year statistics are available, the number of dropout factories fell yet again to 1,634.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose 1,634 low-performing schools represent about 10 to 12 percent of the nation&rsquo;s high schools and still produce about half of the nation&rsquo;s drop outs, said Colleen Wilber, a spokeswoman for the America&rsquo;s Promise Alliance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEvery state has at least one &quot;dropout factory,&quot; which Balfanz defines as a school in which at least 40 percent of freshmen fail to make it to their senior year. For high schools that only have grades 10-12, his reports examine how sophomore year enrollment compares to the senior year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe reports do not identify any of the troubled schools by name. The largest number are in the South. Virginia had 29 of them in 2009, 25 in 2008, and 26 back in 2002.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott&rsquo;s bill -- also introduced in the Senate by Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa -- would strengthen regulations developed in 2008 that require states to use the same formula in reporting high school graduation rates. It would set a national graduation rate goal of 90 percent. The national high school graduation was 74.9 percent in 2008, the last year data was available.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo sum up:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott said that nearly 2,000 high schools, about 12 percent of those in the U.S., produce half the nation&rsquo;s dropouts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe accurately cited a report based on 2006 data. An updated study found the number of low-performing schools dropped to 1,634 in 2009. &nbsp;That does not diminish Scott&rsquo;s point that a small percentage of high schools have an enormous impact on the nation&rsquo;s dropout problem.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Scott&rsquo;s claim True.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-05T20:18:04.865565", "ruling_date": "2011-05-06T08:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
