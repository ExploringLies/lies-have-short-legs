Humayun Khan&rsquo;s 2004 death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It all began when Khizr Khan, Humayun&rsquo;s father, seared Trump in <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/29/backstory-muslim-soldiers-dad-who-said-trump-sacri/\">an emotional speech</a> at the Democratic National Convention. Trump responded by <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-father-fallen-soldier-ive-made-lot/story?id=41015051\">criticizing</a> Khizr&rsquo;s wife, Ghazala (who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ghazala-khan-donald-trump-criticized-my-silence-he-knows-nothing-about-true-sacrifice/2016/07/31/c46e52ec-571c-11e6-831d-0324760ca856_story.html\">responded</a> in the <em>Washington Post</em>) and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/760070280932982784\">crying</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/760074526059270144\">foul</a> over Khizr&rsquo;s &quot;vicious attacks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This earned him the censure of just about everyone. But all this criticism is misdirected, Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/08/03/katrina-pierson-obama-trump-khan-war-cooper-intv-ac.cnn\">said</a>&nbsp;Aug. 2&nbsp;on CNN: &quot;It was under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost (Khan&rsquo;s) life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that Khan died five years before Obama became president and Clinton secretary of state, we were perplexed by this statement, so we reached out to Pierson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pierson told us her point was Clinton <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/01/barack-obama/clinton-and-mccain-had-same-vote-on-iraq-war/\">voted for the war in Iraq</a> in 2002 and &quot;decided not to provide support&quot; and that Obama continued George W. Bush&rsquo;s rules of engagement policy and &quot;further restricted engagement in Afghanistan.&quot; Trump (who, in at least one interview, also <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/22/donald-trump/trump-still-wrong-his-claim-opposed-iraq-war-ahead/\">supported</a> the invasion) had nothing to do with either decision, Pierson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pierson reiterated those points in an Aug. 3,&nbsp;interview with CNN. &quot;Apologize for the timeline. What I was talking about is the fact that Donald Trump has no connection to anything having to do with Capt.&nbsp;Khan, who was a brave war hero. The timeline is very simple and true ...&nbsp;Hillary Clinton voted for the war in Iraq.&nbsp;She did not support the surge. Barack Obama made things worse by invading more countries than President Bush did&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pierson is well within her rights to critique Clinton&rsquo;s voting record and Obama&rsquo;s defense policies. But in her original&nbsp;CNN interview, she went further and said Obama and Clinton changed the rules of engagement that &quot;probably cost&quot; Khan&rsquo;s life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s nonsensical. Even if we put the anachronism aside, experts told us restrictive rules of engagement &nbsp;&mdash; military directives that regulate the use of force in armed conflict &mdash; were not an issue in Khan&rsquo;s death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lt. Col. <a href=\"http://www.tullylegal.com/our-team/davidbolgiano/\">David G. Bolgiano</a> is a retired military officer who served with Special Operations Forces and the 82nd Airborne Division in Iraq and Afghanistan and currently practices military and security law in Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He told us the rules of engagement, which really haven&rsquo;t changed since the Reagan years, give&nbsp;all troops the right to use deadly force to defend themselves. Though the Obama administration has been criticized for directives that seek to limit civilian deaths, that right still applies <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/OLH_2015_Ch5.pdf\">today</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that was the case in <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/usa1203/11.htm\">2004</a>, when Capt. Khan <a href=\"http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/hsmkhan.htm\">died</a> in a suicide bombing at age 27. On June 8, 2004, a taxi packed with explosives drove into the gate of his compound in Baqubah, Iraq, while he was inspecting soldiers on guard duty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to his commanding officer, Khan ordered his man to &quot;hit the ground&quot; as he approached the vehicle and motioned for it to stop. The bomb then exploded, killing Khan as well as the two suicide bombers and two Iraqi civilians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Capt. Khan had all the authority in the world to use deadly force&quot; under the rules of engagement, said Bolgiano, who was serving in Iraq in 2004. He added that Khan&rsquo;s actions were a testament to his bravery and selflessness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The officer makes a judgement call,&quot; said <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/people/anthony-h-cordesman\">Anthony Cordesman</a>, a national security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has advised General Stanley McChrystal. &quot;They are very difficult calls to make. But the officer did what a good officer should do, he took the risk and made a command decision.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Khan was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart and Bronze Star.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts warned that politicization of the rules of engagement were not appropriate and potentially dangerous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can&rsquo;t think of anything worse than somehow getting into a tactical situation where you&rsquo;re going to have to deal with concerns in the field over campaign rhetoric,&quot; Cordesman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pierson said, &quot;It was under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost (Capt. Khan&rsquo;s) life.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, Pierson&rsquo;s point about rules of engagement is inaccurate and irrelevant. Under the rules of engagement in 2004 and today, Khan would have been able to use deadly force to defend himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More importantly, Khan died five years before Obama became president and Clinton his secretary of state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Pierson&rsquo;s claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a0603905-51a6-4a12-b6b4-a1bb62001a80\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a0603905-51a6-4a12-b6b4-a1bb62001a80</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(Update: This fact-check has been updated to include Pierson&#39;s comments on CNN from Aug. 3.)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-03T15:54:08.335576", "ruling_date": "2016-08-03T16:13:13", "ruling_headline": "Trump spox's absurd claim that Clinton, Obama are responsible for Capt.
