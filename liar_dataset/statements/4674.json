It was put out by two groups, Iowans for Some Semblance of Christian Decency and Iowans For Truth and Honest Government, neither of which appears to have a website.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe leaflet declared, &quot;When it came time to stand and defend the most helpless citizens in our country, presidential candidate Herman Cain threw the babies under the bus.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs evidence, sandwiched between a picture of the smiling candidate and another of an aborted fetus, the flier provided a quote from Cain saying, &quot;It ultimately gets down to a choice that that family or that mother has to make.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain, former head of Godfather&rsquo;s Pizza, is known to be an across-the-board conservative, so we decided to see what his position has been.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe quote on the flier comes from an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8WmqiOiUdc\">interview </a>Cain did with CNN&rsquo;s Piers Morgan on Oct. 19, 2011. Here&rsquo;s a transcript of their exchange about abortion:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Morgan: Abortion. What&#39;s your view of abortion?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain: I believe that life begins at conception. And abortion under no circumstances. And here&#39;s why --<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMorgan: No circumstances?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain: No circumstances.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMorgan: Because many of your fellow candidates -- some of them qualify that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain: They qualify but --<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMorgan: Rape and incest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain: Rape and incest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMorgan: Are you honestly saying -- again, it&#39;s a tricky question, I know.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain: Ask the tricky question.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMorgan: But you&#39;ve had children, grandchildren. If one of your female children, grandchildren was raped, you would honestly want her to bring up that baby as her own?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain: You&#39;re mixing two things here, Piers?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMorgan: Why?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCain: You&#39;re mixing --<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMorgan: That&#39;s what it comes down to.</em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Cain: No, it comes down to it&#39;s not the government&#39;s role or anybody else&#39;s role to make that decision. Secondly, if you look at the statistical incidents, you&#39;re not talking about that big a number. So what I&#39;m saying is it ultimately gets down to a choice that that family or that mother has to make. Not me as president, not some politician, not a bureaucrat. It gets down to that family. And whatever they decide, they decide. I shouldn&#39;t have to tell them what decision to make for such a sensitive issue.</em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo first Cain said abortion is allowable under &quot;no circumstances,&quot; but then he seemed to be arguing it wasn&rsquo;t a decision for the government to make, which sounds pretty pro-abortion rights to us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe next day, Cain&rsquo;s campaign issued a <a href=\"http://www.hermancain.com/newsroom\">statement </a>attempting to clarify the point. Cain said he &quot;understood the thrust of the question to ask whether that I, as president, would simply &#39;order&#39; people to not seek an abortion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;My answer was focused on the role of the president. The president has no constitutional authority to order any such action by anyone. That was the point I was trying to convey. As to my political policy view on abortion, I am 100% pro-life. End of story.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe went on to specify that he would appoint anti-abortion judges and oppose any government funding of abortion, including defunding Planned Parenthood.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I will do everything that a president can do, consistent with his constitutional role, to advance the culture of life,&quot; the statement said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven if his explanation was a little clumsy, and did little to quell the controversy that erupted over what he said to Morgan, Cain&#39;s political history supports his anti-abortion stance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2003 and 2004, when he was running in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Georgia, news stories consistently portrayed him as anti-abortion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;An associate pastor of Antioch Baptist Church North in Atlanta, Cain opposes abortion unless it is to save the life of the mother,&quot; the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> wrote on Aug. 10, 2003.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn May 2004, the paper ran a story about his radio ads attacking his primary opponents, one of whom was accused of flip-flopping on the issue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He had the opportunity to protect innocent life and he didn&#39;t. He has been touting that he is pro-life, yet he votes for pro-choice legislation. If he is pro-life, he needs to vote pro-life,&quot; the Cain ad stated, according to the <em>AJC</em>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLater, in 2007, when Cain was working in talk radio, the <em>L.A. Times</em> wrote a story about abortion opponents reaching out to African-American voters. The story said &quot;a political action committee run by black radio talk show host Herman Cain poured $1 million into edgy ads on urban radio. One spot contended that Democratic support for abortion laws is &quot;decimating our people.&quot; It concluded: &quot;Democrats say they want our vote. Why don&#39;t they want our lives?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThroughout this year&rsquo;s presidential campaign Cain has said he&rsquo;s opposed to the procedure, although he prompted controversy once before when he refused to sign a pledge from a conservative group to promise to end all abortion funding.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA June 21, 2011, <em>Boston Globe</em> story said he refused to sign it &quot;because of concern about separation of executive and congressional powers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked with a couple of outside groups -- one on each side of the abortion issue -- to see how they sized up Cain&rsquo;s record.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe National Right to Life Committee posted this <a href=\"http://www.nrlpac.org/pdf/PrimaryCandidateComparison.pdf\">chart </a>indicating Cain has promised to end taxpayer funding of abortions and is opposed to <em>Roe vs. Wade</em>, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. And NARAL Pro-Choice America cites four examples on its <a href=\"http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/elections/2012/gop-presidential-candidates/herman-cain.html\">website </a>that portray Cain opposing abortion rights.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Herman Cain is anti-choice. Any claim to the contrary is wrong,&quot; NARAL communications director Ted Miller said in an e-mail.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe flier in Iowa called Cain a &quot;pro-choice candidate&quot; who &quot;threw the babies under the bus&quot; by making a statement about abortion being a personal choice. He explained himself by saying he was answering a question about presidential powers, not how he feels about the morality or legality of abortion. On that, Cain has been consistent for years -- consistently anti-abortion.
