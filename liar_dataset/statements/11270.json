While addiction and treatment has not traditionally been a top-tier issue in presidential races, it has attracted concern in key caucus and primary states this year, including New Hampshire, where Clinton announced her proposal in an <a href=\"http://www.unionleader.com/article/20150901/OPINION02/150909909/1004/opinion\">op-ed</a> in the <em>New Hampshire Union-Leader</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In explaining why an assertive policy response was necessary, Clinton wrote in the op-ed, among other claims, that &quot;23 million Americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get treatment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if her figures are accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the ratio, Clinton is close. The most recent data from the federally sponsored <a href=\"http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/nationwide-trends\">National Survey on Drug Use and Health</a> estimated that 22.7 million Americans needed treatment for a drug alcohol problem but only about <a href=\"http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/nationwide-trends\">2.5 million received treatment</a> &quot;at a specialty facility.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means 11 percent of people who conceivably could have needed treatment at a specialty facility received it, or one out of every nine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This ratio has <a href=\"http://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/samhsa-fy2016-congressional-justification_2.pdf\">held steady</a> <a href=\"http://www.drugfree.org/new-data-show-millions-of-americans-with-alcohol-and-drug-addiction-could-benefit-from-health-care-r/\">over the years</a>, said Arthur Robinson Williams, a fellow in the division on substance abuse in Columbia University&rsquo;s Department of Psychiatry. &quot;The 2013 survey was consistent with prior findings and estimates,&quot; Williams said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, we wondered about the survey&rsquo;s use of the term &quot;specialty facility.&quot; What does that mean?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150326221316/http://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH-SR200-RecoveryMonth-2014/NSDUH-SR200-RecoveryMonth-2014.htm#fn3\">definition</a>: It refers to &quot;treatment received at drug or alcohol rehabilitation facilities (inpatient or outpatient), hospitals (inpatient services only), and mental health centers; it excludes treatment received in an emergency room, private doctor&#39;s office, self-help group, prison or jail, or hospital as an outpatient.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the forms of treatment not counted are groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not everyone agrees <a href=\"http://www.psmag.com/books-and-culture/75-years-alcoholics-anonymous-time-admit-problem-74268\">that AA is effective</a> (<a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-alcoholics-anonymous-work/\">or effective for everyone</a>), and it is perhaps most helpful as reinforcement to other types of treatment led by clinicians. Still, the number of participants is hardly trivial: AA <a href=\"http://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/smf-53_en.pdf\">counted</a> 1,283,704 members in the United States as of Jan. 1, 2015, plus an additional 35,349 in correctional facilities. Thousands more attended Narcotics Anonymous and other 12-step groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for excluding private doctor visits, the distinctions &nbsp;&quot;are likely true, but largely irrelevant,&quot; said David Rosenbloom, a professor of health policy and management at the Boston University School of Public Health. &quot;Treatment in doctor&rsquo;s offices is a relatively recent development, as medication-assisted addiction treatment through the medical care system has achieved regulatory approval.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While &quot;many people with addiction could be treated in the regular medical care system,&quot; Rosenbloom said, &quot;the delivery mechanism to get from here to there isn&rsquo;t in place yet.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allowing for some definitional concerns about the numbers, Clinton &quot;is mainly right,&quot; said Arthur L. Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at the New York University Langone Medical Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said that &quot;23 million Americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get treatment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be fully accurate, the claim needs some modest tweaks. The actual ratio is about one of nine, not one in 10, and it&rsquo;s worth noting that the treatment statistics include only the most intensive methods, leaving out such widely used approaches as Alcoholics Anonymous. Still, experts said Clinton&rsquo;s claim is close to accurate. We rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-09-03T15:25:39.392008", "ruling_date": "2015-09-04T09:25:58", "ruling_headline": "Hillary Clinton says '23 million Americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get treatment'", "ruling_headline_slug": "hillary-clinton-says-23-million-americans-suffer-a", "ruling_link_text": "Oft-quoted stat is largely correct", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Hillary Clinton, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.unionleader.com/article/20150901/OPINION02/150909909/1004/opinion\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Another View -- Hillary Clinton: How we can win the fight against substance abuse</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 1, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/nationwide-trends\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>DrugFacts: Nationwide Trends</u></a>,&quot; June 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, &quot;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150326221316/http://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH-SR200-RecoveryMonth-2014/NSDUH-SR200-RecoveryMonth-2014.htm#fn3\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Substance Use and Mental Health Estimates from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Overview of Findings</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 4, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillary Clinton, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/p/briefing/factsheets/2015/09/02/combat-addiction/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hillary Clinton&#39;s Initiative to Combat America&#39;s Deadly Epidemic of Drug and Alcohol Addiction</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 1, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alcoholics Anonymous, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/smf-53_en.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Estimates of A.A.
