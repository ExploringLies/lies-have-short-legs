Discretionary spending goes for such things as education, health and housing -- in contrast to mandatory expenditures such as Social Security and Medicare &quot;entitlements.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOutside experts that PolitiFact Wisconsin spoke with quibble a bit about the annual budget figures Ryan uses, but the numbers are not really in dispute. And they do show a big jump -- from $434 billion in 2008 to $537 billion in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that&rsquo;s a 24 percent increase, not the 84 percent claimed by Ryan and his colleagues.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs someone&rsquo;s math fuzzy? Let&rsquo;s dig in to find out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan&rsquo;s calculations also include another number -- the discretionary spending portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the economic stimulus package. That adds another $259 million to the total, which brings it to $797 billion (with rounding) and the 84 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne problem, and it&rsquo;s a significant one in terms of Ryan&rsquo;s statement:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe stimulus package was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/14/us/politics/14web-stim.html?_r=1\">approved in February 2009.</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan includes it in the 2010 totals, so the two-year trend under Obama looks like a rocket headed straight up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you put it in 2009 -- when it was passed -- the two-year trend under Obama looks more like a roller-coaster ride: Up a lot, and then down some but not all the way.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s turn to some budget watchdog groups to assess the approach.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, not everyone agrees it&rsquo;s appropriate to even include the stimulus money in the calculation, since it could be considered one-time emergency spending -- not part of the underlying base. The annual figures that are the basis of Ryan&rsquo;s chart do not include emergency spending, such as for natural disasters or unforeseen war costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama and Democrats argue the stimulus package -- which tallied $862 billion in all --- was the ultimate &quot;emergency&quot; allocation aimed at preventing another Great Depression.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMost experts told PolitiFact Wisconsin it&rsquo;s fine to include it, as long as it appears as a one-time blip -- creating that roller-coaster rise and fall.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The discretionary spending in the stimulus bill has already begun to fade and no one assumes stimulus bill levels of spending will continue every year into the future,&quot; said Joshua Gordon, policy director at The Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that advocates for fiscal responsibility.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis group and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities agree the stimulus funding should be placed in 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s when the vote occurred, when the spending authority for nearly all of it was granted, and that&rsquo;s how the <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/99xx/doc9989/hr1conference.pdf\">Congressional Budget Office records it</a>. And Ryan&rsquo;s own press release, in the fine print, refers to the stimulus funds as 2009 spending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPutting them in 2010 may make a stronger rhetorical point, but a shaky mathematical one.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhy did Ryan do it that way? &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn response, Ryan&rsquo;s office said in an e-mail he presents the budget figure on the chart with and without stimulus funding &quot;so readers can separate the two if they wish.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in his public statements about the increase, he doesn&rsquo;t separate them at all. He uses the higher, skewed number.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan&rsquo;s office also says the cumulative view, not the year to year, is what&rsquo;s important in the spending trend. They say if you just look at 2008 and 2010, it&rsquo;s as if the stimulus never occurred.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the stimulus money was a one time authorization. It is not part of the annual base, so following past Washington accounting practice it belongs in the year it was approved.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, Ryan&rsquo;s office argues his analysis does not include the vast majority of the stimulus spending. That&rsquo;s certainly true. But it&rsquo;s Ryan who limits the statement -- and the discussion of it -- to discretionary spending and when budget authority was granted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan aides said the congressman is not using the figures to make Obama look bad -- he blames the long-term increase in spending on both parties..<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He is making a policy argument that we should return to sustainable levels of government spending,&quot; said spokesman Conor Sweeney.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo be sure, no matter what year you stick it in, that $259 billion in discretionary stimulus funding -- and the massive overall package -- represents a dramatic spending leap.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut if you put it in 2009 -- where evidence says it belongs -- you get a different picture than the one presented by Ryan. If it is there, the change in discretionary spending under Obama was a 70 percent increase in the first year, followed by a 27 percent drop in the second.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat second year is still higher than the starting point, because non-stimulus spending also rose.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat brings us back to the 24 percent overall increase between 2008 and 2010, which is where we began.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd that&rsquo;s where we will end.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn illustrating his point about spending increases under President Obama, Ryan says non-defense discretionary spending has risen 84 percent. There is no doubt that spending is up, or that the one-time stimulus package was a major driver. But sliding the stimulus money from 2009 to 2010 -- whether on a chart or in an interview -- skews the picture.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s a nifty accounting maneuver. But still a maneuver.
