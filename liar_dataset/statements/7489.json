Since his new book <em>Immigration Wars </em>was released this week, Bush has been accused of changing position.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JebBush\">@JebBush</a> a flip-flop-flip on immigration? Wow. I fashioned you more of a baseball player than a gymnast. My bad.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23notsurprisedatall&amp;src=hash\"> #notsurprisedatall</a>,&quot; Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz quipped in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DWStweets/status/309001535386435584\">tweet</a> on March 5, 2013.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBush, 60, has enjoyed distinction as an elder statesman in the Republican party since leaving elected office in 2007. But with the release of his book, Bush has indicated he&rsquo;s considering a future presidential run (&quot;I&rsquo;m not saying yes, I&rsquo;m just not saying no,&quot; he told MSNBC).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found that Bush, now a definite maybe for 2016, has indeed said conflicting things over time about eventual citizenship for illegal immigrants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> &lsquo;Start deporting people&rsquo;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBush, a Texas native who calls Florida his adopted home state, plunged into politics in 1994 with a run to unseat Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBack then, there was virtually no talk of turning millions of illegal immigrants in the U.S. into citizens. When asked what to do with them, Bush had one word: deportation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an interview with the <em>Miami Herald</em>, he was asked, &quot;There are something like 4 million illegals in the United States . . . . What would you do with the ones that are here?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Start deporting people,&quot; he answered. &quot;We have an asylum process . . . . It shouldn&#39;t take five years. We need to reform our system. ... I don&#39;t blame them for wanting to come to our country, but I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s necessarily our responsibility to allow them to come in.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut he also made it clear he was not in favor of closing the border. &quot;I believe in open, legal immigration,&quot; Bush said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe lost that election, but stormed back four years later and won the governor&rsquo;s race.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy 2006, Bush was well-established as Florida&rsquo;s chief executive, and he wasn&rsquo;t afraid to criticize members of his own party. His views, it seems, had evolved beyond &quot;start deporting people.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an email exchange with the <em>Los Angeles Times </em>that year, Bush weighed in with support for proposed federal immigration reform legislation, calling it &quot;just plain wrong&quot; to charge illegal immigrants with a felony and opposed &quot;penalizing the children of illegal immigrants&quot; by denying them U.S. citizenship.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe endorsed the idea of a broad guest-worker program, but the <em>Los Angeles Times </em>noted then that he &quot;offered no specificity on how to treat current immigrants and whether they should be granted a path to citizenship.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2009, Bush co-chaired a bipartisan task force for the Council on Foreign Relations, which studied immigration challenges and came up with a set of proposals. In an interview about the group&rsquo;s recommendations, Bush said that if reform doesn&rsquo;t happen, &quot;we ignore an issue that needs to be solved, which is what do we do with people who are here permanently, who have made contributions, who if given a path to citizenship would do what&#39;s right and take the necessary steps to achieve legalized status and citizenship.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, in a <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/13/opinion/oe-bush13\">separate op-ed</a> about the task force recommendations, Bush simply said reform should include &quot;a fair and orderly way to allow many of those currently living here illegally to earn the right to remain legally.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>2012: Bush stakes his position<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t</strong>Last year, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney declared that he would pursue an immigration policy so austere that illegal immigrants would self-deport -- a position later faulted for Republicans&rsquo; poor showing among Hispanic voters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBush, meanwhile, continued his call for more welcoming rhetoric and a &quot;broader approach&quot; to legislation that dealt with issues beyond border security and cracking down on illegal migration. In an interview last summer with Charlie Rose, he made a clear declaration that he favored citizenship.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You have to deal with this issue. You can&rsquo;t ignore it. And so, either a path to citizenship, which I would support and that does put me probably out of the mainstream of most conservatives; Or a path to legalization, a path to residency of some kind,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFast forward past the election. It&rsquo;s now 2013, and Republicans are smarting from their losses and pledging to remake their platform into one that appeals more to Hispanics and other minorities. A bipartisan group of Senators is working on reform legislation that includes citizenship.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Bush&rsquo;s book, which reportedly went to the printer in late 2012, split the concepts of citizenship and legal residency. And in print, Bush opposed citizenship and instead proposed &quot;a path to permanent legal resident status.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Permanent residency in this context, however, should not lead to citizenship. It is absolutely vital to the integrity of our immigration system that actions have consequences &mdash; in this case, that those who violated the laws can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship. ... A grant of citizenship is an undeserving reward for conduct that we cannot afford to encourage.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIllegal immigrants, he and co-author Clint Bolick wrote, could return to their homeland and apply for citizenship through regular channels.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter immediately catching heat over the book -- and how it conflicts with his past position -- Bush began softening up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We wrote this book last year, not this year, and we proposed a path to legalization, so anybody that had come illegally would have immediately a path to legalization,&quot; Bush said on MSNBC.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe added: &quot;If you can craft that in law, where you can have a path to citizenship where there isn&rsquo;t an incentive for people to come illegally, I&rsquo;m for it. I don&rsquo;t have a problem with that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe told CNN: &quot;I have supported both &mdash; both a path to legalization or a path to citizenship &mdash; with the underlying principle being that there should be no incentive for people to come illegally at the expense of coming legally.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJaryn Emhof, Bush&rsquo;s communications director, told PolitiFact in an email, &quot;The book outlines a proposal by which immigrants -- whether they are coming to work temporarily, to go to school, to live and work as permanent residents or seeking citizenship -- can do so through an immigration process that would be much more open than before. So, it is talking about future immigrants, not those currently here illegally.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe think it&rsquo;s clear, however, that the book&rsquo;s passages about legal status vs. citizenship very clearly refer to those already here.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t</strong>Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- admittedly a bit player in this story but for her tweet -- said Bush has made a &quot;flip-flop-flip&quot; on immigration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s a quick chronology:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Early in his political life, Bush expressed a hard-line, deportation-driven opinion and made no mention of granting citizenship or legal status to illegal immigrants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Sometime between 2009 and 2012, he &quot;flipped&quot; to being in favor of a path to citizenship. He supported federal legislation in 2007 that allowed children of illegal immigrants to become citizens, and wrote frequently that Republicans should adopt a more welcoming approach. In June 2012, he clearly articulated support for a pathway to citizenship.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; His &quot;flop&quot; came this month with the release of his book, in which he explicitly opposed citizenship, calling it an &quot;undeserving reward&quot; for people who came here illegally.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; That was followed by a quick &quot;flip&quot; back to support of either citizenship or permanent legal status in the heat of television interviews.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOver the years Bush has said he favored citizenship <em>or </em>legal residency, demonstrating openness to proposals that could be considered within a wider reform effort. So at times he has embraced both, or either one.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s no doubt, though, that the Jeb Bush in the book had a different opinion from the Jeb Bush on the book tour.
