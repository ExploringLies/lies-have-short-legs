Xavier penned a catchy refrain that stuck: &quot;Farouk, Farouk, Farouk is on fire, serving da community his number one desire.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe wonder: Was Shami ever on fire?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFirst, let&#39;s review the lyrics the campaign sent in March.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Who got da new solutions for Texas... Farouk! / when it comes to da state who&#39;s gon rep it... Farouk! / now say it Farouk Farouk Farouk is on fire / serving da community his number one desire... </em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Came to America 44 years ago / 71 dollars to his name now dat&#39;s pocket change / kinda like President Obama a few years ago, in his mind frame it&#39;s time to change / creating Texas jobs &amp; reforming health care / he cares if nobody else cares, elsewhere / providing quality education / preserving our environment / Farouk is on fire please call da fireman / his drive is inspiring / lives he inspire them...</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tXavier, a Houston native, wrote &quot;Tell Your Mama to Vote for Obama&quot; during the 2008 presidential campaign, but that song made no reference to pyrotechnics.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, chants of &quot;fired up, ready to go&quot; were often heard during Obama&#39;s campaign rallies.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tShami falls in line with a other office-seekers who have dabbled with fire. The late Reagan Brown, who once served as state agriculture commissioner, infamously stuck his hand in a fire-ant mound as a campaign stunt in 1982, only to have the fiery pests swarm up and bite his arm.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat about Shami&#39;s personal relationship with fire?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn Nov. 19, the Houston Chronicle reported that Shami had come &quot;under fire&quot; when a conservative commentator claimed his support for Palestinian rights put him opposition to Israel. The Chronicle later pointed out that Shami could fire his employees, some of whom quit rather than be fired.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe couldn&#39;t reach Shami to gauge if he was ever truly &quot;on fire.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut seeing as we&#39;ve <a href=\"http://politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/feb/04/farouk-shami/farouk-shami-says-bill-white-discriminating-taking/\" target=\"_blank\">previously rated a Shami statement</a> as Pants on Fire, he definitely was<em> en fuego</em> here.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, we must rate J. Xavier&#39;s statement as True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd we wish you a happy April Fools&#39; Day.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-31T18:44:33.561528", "ruling_date": "2010-04-01T00:10:00", "ruling_headline": "Rapper J.
