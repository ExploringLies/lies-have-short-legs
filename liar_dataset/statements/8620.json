This is about making Washington work &mdash; regardless of who is in the White House or who controls the Senate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But just how stuck was the Senate? In a recent blog post, Blue Oregon writer Carla Axtman painted a pretty dire picture:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Senate has been in a grind for a very long time, but the worst of it has come in the last five years where Senate Republicans have placed a filibuster on every piece of legislation and every nominee,&quot; she wrote. &quot;The body was for all practical terms in paralysis, requiring a 60 vote majority to do anything.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She doubled down on the point a few sentences later: &quot;All the while, the GOP kept right on filibustering. Not just some of the time. ALL of the time. Every move in the Senate required a 60 vote majority to do anything.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there&rsquo;s one truth about us fact-checkers, it&rsquo;s that superlatives draw our collective eye. The Senate had experienced significant gridlock, but could it be true that Republicans filibustered &quot;every piece of legislation and every nominee&quot;? We decided to look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As usual, we started with the source of the claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Axtman, to her credit, immediately toned down her piece after we raised concerns. It now reads that Republicans had &quot;placed a filibuster on virtually every piece of serious legislation and nominee.&quot; (Emphasis ours.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was not as clear as I should have been,&quot; Axtman said. &quot;I should probably have added a qualifying word in there. &hellip; To be fair, I thought I should change it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s super important to me to be upfront and clear.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We appreciate a quick response. Still, we generally push forward with a fact check on the original language even if it&rsquo;s adjusted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help explain what she&rsquo;d based her assertion on, Axtman pointed us to a piece from Mother Jones, a liberal-leaning magazine, that explored the use of the filibuster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Authors Kevin Drum and Jaeah Lee used strong language to describe Republican obstruction, but nothing near as absolute as what Axtman had said. &quot;Republicans went into full-bore filibuster mode the day he [President Barack Obama] took office, and they&#39;ve kept it up ever since,&quot; they wrote. &quot;For all practical purposes, anything more controversial than renaming a post office has required 60 votes during the entire Obama presidency.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That 60-vote bar is a reference to the number of votes it takes to achieve cloture or end a filibuster. You&rsquo;ll notice here, though, the caveats of &quot;for practical purposes&quot; and &quot;anything more controversial than renaming a post office.&quot; They gave themselves wiggle room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get a broader, more informed perspective, we rang up James Thurber, the head of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of judicial and bureaucratic nominees, he said, &nbsp;&quot;this culture of polarization has created an almost-constant threat of filibuster from the Republican Party.&quot; But, he noted, &quot;that&rsquo;s not as bold as saying they&rsquo;ve filibustered every nomination.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Republicans cut a deal in July after Democrats threatened to change filibuster rules. &quot;Democrats agreed not to change the rules, but reserved the right to do so later if they feel the need. In return, President Obama gained confirmation of several nominees,&quot; the Los Angeles Times reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gina McCarthy, for one, was confirmed as head of the Environmental Protection Agency a day after the deal was made on a vote of 59-40.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly some nominations, though fewer than with previous administrations, were approved without having to pass the 60-vote bar. (PolitiFact National has looked more closely at this issue. By their calculations, on Nov. 21, 2013, there had been &quot;68 individual nominees blocked prior to Obama taking office and 79 (so far) during Obama&rsquo;s term, for a total of 147.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s another point worth making, too. Legislation faced less threat of filibuster than appointments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In most cases, it&rsquo;s a done deal before they consider the bill on the floor,&quot; Thurber said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s little question that Senate Republicans took using the filibuster as a tool of obstruction to a new extreme. But Axtman undercut herself by using superlatives. Twice in her piece, she hammered home that filibusters happened &quot;not just some of the time. ALL of the time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we appreciate her move to change the words after we brought them to her attention, we rate this claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-12-03T19:40:41.917230", "ruling_date": "2013-12-03T16:40:15", "ruling_headline": "Have Senate Republicans filibustered every nominee end every piece of legislation under President Barack Obama?", "ruling_headline_slug": "have-senate-republicans-filibusted-every-nominee-e", "ruling_link_text": "Might feel that way, but no.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview with James Thurber, the head of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington, Dec. 3, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carla Axtman, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.blueoregon.com/2013/11/us-sen-filibuster-reform-reality-thanks-jeff-merkley/\">US Sen: Filibuster reform a reality thanks to Jeff Merkley</a>,&quot; Nov. 22, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huffington Post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/18/epa-administrator-gina-mccarthy_n_3619548.html\">EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy&rsquo;s Confirmation: Barack Obama, Al Gore And Others React</a>,&quot; July 18, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/22/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-82-presidential-nominees-have-been/\">Harry Reid says 82 presidential nominees have been blocked under President Barack Obama, 86 blocked under all other presidents</a>,&quot; Nov. 21, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mother Jones, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/11/charts-explain-why-democrats-went-nuclear-filibuster\">3 Charts Explain Why Democrats Went Nuclear on the Filibuster</a>,&quot; Nov. 22, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Los Angeles Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jul/17/nation/la-na-0717-senate-filibuster-20130717\">In Obama win, Senate reaches filibuster deal</a>,&quot; July 17, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/22/harry-reid/harry-reid-among-flip-floppers-senates-nuclear-opt/\">Harry Reid among flip-floppers on Senate&rsquo;s &lsquo;nuclear option,&rsquo;</a>&quot; Nov. 21, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Blogger", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Carla", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Oregon", "id": 2529, "last_name": "Axtman", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "carla-axtman", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 18, "party": "Columnist", "party_slug": "columnist", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/18/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/CARLA.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2529/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.blueoregon.com/author/carla-axtman/"}, "statement": "<p>Says in the last five years &quot;Senate Republicans have placed a filibuster on every piece of legislation and every nominee.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an online article.", "statement_date": "2013-11-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 254, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/254/", "subject": "Congress", "subject_slug": "congress", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/6/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 187, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/187/", "subject": "Congressional Rules", "subject_slug": "congressional-rules", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 131, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/131/", "subject": "Government Efficiency", "subject_slug": "government-efficiency", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
