Patterson wrote, according to the report: &quot;Hector&#39;s a friend and fellow actor. We were both in the recent movie &lsquo;The Alamo&rsquo;, filmed near Austin, albeit on different sides in the conflict (actually Hector had a real part, I was just an extra). When Hector surrendered at San Jacinto, I should have shot him when I had the chance... &quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I hope folks understand then we were just acting, now it&#39;s a real war,&quot; the item quotes Patterson saying.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tContacted later, Patterson &mdash; who once helped pass Texas&#39; concealed-weapon law &mdash; said he was joking about any shooting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If it&#39;s not tongue-in-cheek stuff, that&#39;s a criminal offense,&quot; Patterson said. &quot;You&#39;re not supposed to threaten people. Does this put me on the (federal) no-fly list?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tProbably not. Especially when it&#39;s all just in good fun &mdash; and he didn&#39;t really make a threat. He just expressed ex post facto regret.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis is why we love Texas politics. Where else would a (pretend) gunfight spill into a (real) race for land commissioner? And where else would we get to fact check a claim like this one?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor making us laugh and for reminding us not to take this stuff too seriously, we give Uribe&#39;s claim that he was threatened a rating of Pants on Fire.
