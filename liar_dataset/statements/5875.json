In 2007, the Supreme Court had ruled in<em> <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-1074.ZS.html\">Ledbetter vs. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</a></em> that the 180-day statute of limitations started from the day an employer made the decision to discriminate &mdash; making it harder for employees who claimed such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJust what did Romney have to say about the law? We asked the Romney and Obama campaigns and conducted our own search.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney&rsquo;s campaign didn&rsquo;t respond, but the Obama campaign pointed us to a<em> Washington Post</em> blog post and an ABC News interview.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <em>Washington Post </em>report by Greg Sargent, the week before the ABC News interview, was based on an April 11, 2012, &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxl05HYTCZ0&amp;feature=youtu.be\">conference call</a> between Romney advisers and reporters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a clip, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-stein\">Sam Stein</a>, a political reporter at the Huffington Post, asks, &quot;Does Gov. Romney support the Lilly Ledbetter Act?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Romney adviser answers, &quot;Sam, we&rsquo;ll get back to you on that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSargent, in his blog post, <a href=\"http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entries/romney-spokeswoman-we-wont-get-rid-of-lilly\">cites a TPM report</a> that Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul later clarified in an email: &quot;He supports pay equity and is not looking to change current law.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Romney&rsquo;s advisers didn&rsquo;t say &quot;whether he would have vetoed or signed&quot; the act. But it&rsquo;s a stretch to say he &quot;refused&quot; to say &mdash; the question wasn&rsquo;t about whether he would have vetoed or signed the law, but whether he supported it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about the ABC News interview?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn April 16, 2012, reporter <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-diane-sawyer-sits-mitt-ann-romney/story?id=16150624&amp;singlePage=true\">Diane Sawyer asked Romney</a>, &quot; If you were president &mdash; you had been president &mdash; would you have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Law?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s how Romney responded:<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n\t<em><strong>ROMNEY: </strong>&quot;It&#39;s certainly a piece of legislation I have no intention of changing.

But he also said he supported &quot;equal pay for women&quot; and had &quot;no intention of changing that law.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose news reports were consistent with others we found.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Obama campaign said Romney &quot;has refused to say whether he would have vetoed or signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.&quot; That&rsquo;s essentially what happened in Romney&rsquo;s ABC News interview in April, but the claim leaves out some details that matter to Julia.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe relevant point for Julia isn&#39;t whether Romney would sign the bill &mdash; it&#39;s already the law &mdash; but his decision not to change it. Romney also said he &nbsp;&quot;certainly support(s) equal pay for women,&quot; and has &quot;no intention of changing that law.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, the Obama campaign is correct that he dodged the question, so we rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>CORRECTION: </strong>A previous version of this item said the Supreme Court&#39;s<em> Ledbetter</em> decision made it &quot;impossible for employees who learned of such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay.&quot; In fact, the court declined to address the question of whether employees who learned of discrimination after the statute of limitations expired would be protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-08T16:10:31.783619", "ruling_date": "2012-05-08T17:04:43", "ruling_headline": "'Life of Julia' says Romney refused to say if he would sign equal pay law", "ruling_headline_slug": "life-julia-says-romney-refused-say-if-he-would-sig", "ruling_link_text": "Romney said he won't change law", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBarack Obama for President, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/life-of-julia\">The Life of Julia</a>,&quot; accessed May 8, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGovernment Printing Office, <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ2/pdf/PLAW-111publ2.pdf\">Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009</a>, accessed May 8, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLibrary of Congress&rsquo; Thomas, <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN00181:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp;\">CRS Summary of Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009</a>, accessed May 8, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Senate, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00014\">Vote on Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009</a>, Jan. 22, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. House, <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll037.xml\">Vote on Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009</a>, Jan. 27, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCornell University Law School, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-1074.ZS.html\">Ledbetter v.
