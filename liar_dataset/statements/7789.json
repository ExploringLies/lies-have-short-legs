He told us he based his claim on news articles about the 0.05 recommendation, including a <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/us-agency-backs-lower-bloodalcohol-limit-for-drivers-qv9usje-207464501.html\">report</a> from the <em>Journal Sentinel </em>and The Associated Press, and a <a href=\"http://www.tabc.state.tx.us/enforcement/blood_alcohol_percentage_chart.asp\">chart</a> on blood-alcohol concentration from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe news covered the recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates transportation accidents and makes recommendations based on its findings. The board said states should cut the current blood-alcohol level for evidence of intoxication as part of a series of ideas aimed at reducing alcohol-related highway deaths.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tIn its report, the Associated Press <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/progress-sought-drunken-driving-deaths\">said</a> 0.05 is &quot;about one drink for a woman weighing less than 120 pounds,&quot; and that a drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine, or 1 ounce of 80-proof alcohol &quot;in most studies.&quot;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMeanwhile, the Texas agency chart that Stenger cited says its BAC data comes from another federal body, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which works to prevent highway crashes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThat data says essentially what Stenger and AP did: A 100-pound woman could reach 0.05 after one drink.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t(Incidentally, both the AP and the chart used by the Texas agency said a 160-pound man could reach 0.05 after consuming two drinks in one hour.)</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSo, there&rsquo;s evidence that a limited group of drinkers -- women weighing under 120 pounds -- could be legally drunk after one drink, if the standard for drunken driving were reduced to a blood-alcohol level of 0.05.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWhat other evidence is out there?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>BAC</strong> <strong>calculators</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe checked three online calculators that provide blood-alcohol concentration estimates based on various factors, including gender and weight. They generally found a BAC of less than 0.05 for a 100-pound woman consuming one drink.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/safety/motorist/drunkdriving/calculator.htm\">calculator</a> at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (which also has a <a href=\"http://www.zeroinwisconsin.gov/index.html\">smartphone app</a>), says the BAC would be 0.03.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tA more detailed <a href=\"http://oade.nd.edu/educate-yourself-alcohol/blood-alcohol-concentration/bac-calculator/\">calculator</a> from the University of Notre Dame&rsquo;s Office of Alcohol and Drug Education says the BAC would be 0.04 for a 5-ounce glass of wine, if the wine is red and 12.5 percent alcohol.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tAnd the <a href=\"http://www.ccsu.edu/page.cfm?p=3657\">calculator</a> at Central Connecticut State University&rsquo;s Office of Alcohol and Drug Education says the BAC would be 0.05 after a 5-ounce glass of table wine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tSo, why do the blood-alcohol concentration figures vary?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWell, as we noted, all of the figures are estimates.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe Wisconsin DOT also <a href=\"http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/safety/motorist/drunkdriving/calculator.htm\">points out</a> that besides gender, weight and the amount of alcohol consumed, other factors are in play. Your BAC will be higher if you drink faster or drink on an empty stomach. Women reach higher BACs faster because they have less water in their bodies and more adipose tissue (fat), which is not easily penetrated by alcohol.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tJan Grebel, a chemical test supervisor for the DOT, told us about another factor: If you drink frequently, your liver can break down alcohol more efficiently, but if you don&rsquo;t, your BAC would be higher after even one drink.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tGrebel quoted to us from a chart she utilizes when testifying in court in drunken driving cases. She said the chart estimates the BAC at 0.047 -- nearly 0.05 -- for a 100-pound woman after one drink.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tBut Grebel said that would be the maximum BAC in that instance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tMost people would not reach 0.05 after one drink, she said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe Tavern League of Wisconsin said a proposal to make 0.05 the standard for drunken driving would mean that having a glass of wine at dinner could make a person drunk.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tThe statement is accurate, in that it&rsquo;s possible an individual could reach 0.05 after one drink. But it needs additional information, namely that the situation would apply only in a small number of instances and would depend on other factors, such as drinking on an empty stomach.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWe rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-05-16T13:34:26.230187", "ruling_date": "2013-05-17T08:20:33", "ruling_headline": "A lower drunken driving standard means a person could be drunk after one drink?", "ruling_headline_slug": "005-glass-wine-could-make-person-legally-drunk-wis", "ruling_link_text": "If you're a woman who weighs about a hundred, yes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid--c3574bf-ae67-5e25-38df-b39ec447b89a\">\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/us-agency-backs-lower-bloodalcohol-limit-for-drivers-qv9usje-207464501.html\">&quot;U.S. agency backs lower blood-alcohol limit for drivers,&quot;</a> May 14, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tInterview, Wisconsin Tavern League lobbyist Scott Stenger, May 15, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tInterview, Wisconsin Department of Transportation chemical test supervisor Jan Grebel, May 15, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tInterview, Wisconsin State Patrol Maj.
