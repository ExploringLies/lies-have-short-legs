We figured this was worth a look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the minimum wage. Starting on Jan. 1, 1978, the<a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>minimum wage</u></a> was $2.65. Someone working at the minimum wage for 13 weeks, and 40 hours per week, in the summer of 1978 would have ended up with $1,378 for their labors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the tuition they would have faced in the 1978-79 school year, we turned to<a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_381.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>figures</u></a> from the National Center for Education Statistics, the federal government&rsquo;s repository of education data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cost of tuition and fees (in that year&rsquo;s dollars, not adjusted for inflation) was $688 for in-state residents attending a four-year, public university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the meme&rsquo;s claim is correct except for a few caveats -- two minor and one more significant:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The cost of tuition and fees plus room and board was significantly higher that year --<strong> </strong>$2,145 -- but the meme was careful to cite &quot;tuition&quot; only, so we&rsquo;ll ignore the impact of room and board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The tuition-and-fees figure we used is a national average, so some states may have had in-state tuition rates out of reach of minimum wage workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The meme&rsquo;s only notable failing has to do with overly broad wording -- specifically its use of the phrase &quot;of their choice.&quot; The data we used refers to in-state tuition, meaning that the student would have access to this sweet tuition rate <em>only </em>at their home-state university. That&rsquo;s not the same thing as &quot;of their choice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meme said<strong> </strong>that &quot;in 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year&#39;s full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you use the national average the figure is correct. The only problem is the part about a university &quot;of their choice.&quot; The data is correct for in-state tuition -- not for any university in the country, where out-of-state rates may well have kicked<strong> </strong>up the tuition amount beyond a summer&rsquo;s minimum-wage haul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>CORRECTION</em><em>: After we published this article, a reader noticed that we had used the incorrect tuition figure from the National Center for Education Statistics chart. This version uses the correct figure. The rating remains at Mostly True.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<script src=\"http://www.politifact.com/media/js/politifactwidget5.js\"></script>", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-07T17:01:10.914976", "ruling_date": "2014-08-08T12:09:05", "ruling_headline": "Could a minimum-wage earner in 1978 earn enough in a summer to pay a full year's tuition?", "ruling_headline_slug": "1978-someone-minimum-wage-could-earn-enough-summer", "ruling_link_text": "Glory days, they'll pass you by, glory days ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>OurTime.org, social media <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OurTimeOrg/photos/a.196549437047190.41358.160389977329803/721170997918362/?type=1&amp;theater\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>meme</u></a>, July 31, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Center for Education Statistics, &quot;<a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_381.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Average undergraduate tuition and fees and room and board rates charged for full-time students in degree-granting institutions, by level and control of institution: 1969-70 through 2011-12</u></a>,&quot; accessed Aug. 7, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Labor, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>History of Federal Minimum Wage Rates Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 1938 - 2009</u></a>,&quot; accessed Aug. 7, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Carly Lindauer, spokeswoman for the College Board, Aug. 7, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 14, "current_job": "Social media posting", "false_count": 18, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 1486, "last_name": "Facebook posts", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "facebook-posts", "pants_count": 37, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Facebook_icon_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1486/", "total_count": 101, "true_count": 6, "website": "http://www.facebook.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;In 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year&#39;s full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a meme on social media", "statement_date": "2014-08-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>We strive to make our work completely accurate.
