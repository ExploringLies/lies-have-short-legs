According to campaign finance data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/expend.php?cycle=2014&amp;cid=N00013131&amp;type=I\"><u>Cantor spent $168,000</u></a> on fundraising events at three Virginia restaurants -- Bobby Van&rsquo;s Grill, Bobby Van&#39;s Steakhouse, and Blt Steak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary.php?cycle=2014&amp;id=VA07\"><u>Brat spent a little less than $123,000</u></a> across the board for his campaign, according to the most recent campaign finance reports, which cover spending up until May 21, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, Cantor outspent Brat more than 40 to 1, according to available records, and still lost by 10 percentage points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s good reason for the collective astonishment -- this is a rare event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can&#39;t think of any (case) in which the incumbent&#39;s spending advantage was so huge and he still lost,&quot; said Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California San Diego.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another political scientist, John Sides at George Washington University, has a database with about 9,100 House general election contests. Sides tracks which candidate won and which spent the most money. Being outspent was a clear disadvantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In only 10 percent of races did the candidate who got outspent actually win,&quot; Sides said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, this concerns general elections, not primary contests like the one Cantor lost, but Sides said the pattern wouldn&rsquo;t change much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Money is a very tangible perk that comes with incumbency. The Center for Responsive Politics calculated the odds of a challenger beating an incumbent going back to 1998. In the best year, 2006, challengers who spent $1 million or less, like Brat, had a 1 percent chance of winning. In every other election, their odds were much worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Todd said that Cantor spent more at steakhouses than Brat did in his entire campaign. The latest campaign finance reports back that up. Cantor spent $168,000 on steakhouse dinners<strong> </strong>to Brat&rsquo;s $123,000 spent in the overall campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-06-11T15:04:08.434874", "ruling_date": "2014-06-11T16:49:42", "ruling_headline": "Rare feat: Cantor spent more at steakhouses than opponent did on campaign", "ruling_headline_slug": "rare-feat-cantor-spent-more-steakhouses-opponent-d", "ruling_link_text": "Food for thought", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/us/politics/cantors-loss-a-bad-omen-for-moderates.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-thecaucus&amp;_r=0\"><u>Cantor&rsquo;s Loss a Bad Omen for Moderates</u></a>, June10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Insider, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/eric-cantor-loss-steakhouse-spending-2014-6\"><u>The Amount Of Money Eric Cantor&#39;s Campaign Spent On Steakhouses Says It All</u></a>, June 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=cantor%20steakhouse&amp;src=typd\"><u>Cantor steakhouse tweets</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/expend.php?cycle=2014&amp;cid=N00013131&amp;type=I\"><u>Expenditures - Cantor Campaign Committee</u></a>, 2013-2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary.php?cycle=2014&amp;id=VA07\"><u>Virginia District 07 Race</u></a>, 2013-2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/cost.php?cycle=2012\"><u>The Dollars and Cents of Incumbency</u></a>, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/bigspenders.php?cycle=2012&amp;display=S&amp;Memb=H&amp;sort=A\"><u>Winning vs. Spending</u></a>, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/cand2cand.php?cycle=2012\"><u>Candidate to Candidate Giving</u></a>, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Responsive Politics, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2014/06/dont-blame-steakhouses-for-cantors-fall/\"><u>Don&rsquo;t Blame Steakhouses for Cantor&rsquo;s Fall</u></a>, June 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>House Committee on Ethics, <a href=\"http://ethics.house.gov/campaign-activity/proper-use-campaign-funds-and-resources#campaign_permissible_uses_campaign_funds\"><u>Proper Use of Campaign Funds and Resources</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Library of Economics and Liberty, <a href=\"http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/CampaignFinance.html\"><u>Campaign Finance</u></a>, 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, John Sides, associate professor of political science, George Washington University, June 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Gary Jacobson, professor of political science, University of California San Diego, June 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "MSNBC political reporter", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Chuck", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 2821, "last_name": "Todd", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "chuck-todd", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/2014-06-11_15_00_39-Greenshot.png", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2821/", "total_count": 6, "true_count": 4, "website": "https://twitter.com/chucktodd"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Cantor&#39;s campaign spent more at steakhouses than Brat spent on his entire campaign.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "comments on MSNBC", "statement_date": "2014-06-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 154, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/154/", "subject": "Campaign Finance", "subject_slug": "campaign-finance", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
