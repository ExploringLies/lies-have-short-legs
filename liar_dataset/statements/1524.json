We decided to appraise Tuggey&rsquo;s donations and the viewpoints of Democrats who fielded his contributions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMercer shared with us a list indicating Tuggey has given nearly $43,000 to 19 Democratic candidates and three pro-Democratic political committees since 2001.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&#39;s right. Our check of state and federal records shows that Tuggey&#39;s donations to Democrats amounted to $33,616 to nine candidates for federal office and three national political committees plus $9,100 donated to 10 Democratic candidates for state office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTuggey doesn&rsquo;t deny he&rsquo;s helped Democrats. But he also says that since 2004, he and his law firm have given about three times as much money to Republicans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn his campaign Web site, he notes that his firm has represented the Bexar County Republican Party at no charge. The site says his firm also represented the state&rsquo;s Republican U.S. House members in the last round of redistricting litigation and it represents only Republicans in campaign and ethics disputes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTuggey initially told us all his Democratic donations occurred because he was helping clients advance issues such as keeping taxes low or funding veterans&rsquo; care. He later conceded that in some cases, he pitched in for candidates simply because they asked for a donation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMercer said the second part of his blast&mdash;that the Tuggey-assisted Democrats &quot;support abortion and same-sex marriage&quot; is based on the Democratic Party platform.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The Republican platform is clearly pro-life (and anti-abortion) and pro-traditional marriage,&quot; Mercer said. &quot;The Democrat Party platform is not.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMercer didn&rsquo;t say so, but his ad&#39;s reference to Democrats supporting abortion was a shorthand stab that absurdly suggests Democrats want abortions to occur &mdash; a claim that&#39;s not the same as favoring a woman&#39;s right to have an abortion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBesides, not all Democrats support abortion rights. &quot;We are a big-tent party,&quot; said Kirsten Gray, spokeswoman for the state Democrats. &quot;There are Democrats who support the right of a woman to terminate her pregnancy and there are Democrats who don&rsquo;t.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAs for where Democrats stand on same-sex marriage, we didn&#39;t check with every Democrat who got a Tuggey donation. But one of them, state Sen. Carlos Uresti of San Antonio, said he&rsquo;s never supported same-sex marriage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Absolutely not,&quot; Uresti said. &quot;I&rsquo;m a Marine, damnit.&quot; (Uresti said he voted in 2005 in favor of placing a proposed constitutional ban on gay marriage before voters, who later approved the proposal. In the official House record, however, Uresti is listed as absent from the floor vote that advanced the measure.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMercer&#39;s reasoning presumes that every Democrat who fielded a Tuggey donation hews to the party&rsquo;s state and national platforms, statements of beliefs drafted and adopted by party convention delegates every two years at the state level and every four years at the national level. So we looked for language relating to abortion and same-sex marriage in the latest Democratic platforms.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat we found: The state party platform of 2008 states Texas Democrats &quot;trust the women of Texas to make personal and responsible decisions about when and whether to bear children, in consultation with their family, their physician, personal conscience or their God, rather than having these personal decisions made by politicians.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTexas Democrats also &quot;support prevention measures which have proven effective at reducing unintended pregnancies, and which would reduce the rate of abortion when made affordable, accessible, and available as effective long-term programs,&quot; the platform states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe national Democratic platform of 2008 states: &quot;The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade (the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion) and a woman&#39;s right to choose a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay, and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSame-sex marriage isn&#39;t mentioned in the state Democrats&rsquo; platform. But there is language indicating the party believes in protecting personal privacy and opposing discrimination in &quot;all forms.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe national Democratic platform states: &quot;We support the full inclusion of all families, including same-sex couples, in the life of our nation, and support equal responsibility, benefits, and protections. We will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non-discrimination act. We oppose the Defense of Marriage Act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Defense of Marriage Act defines marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman for purposes of all federal laws, and provides that states need not recognize a marriage from another state if it is between persons of the same sex.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo does Mercer&rsquo;s ad hold up?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMercer got the math part right. Tuggey actually gave more than $42,000 to Democrats or Democratic committees, though Mercer&#39;s ad overlooks Tuggey&#39;s donations to Republicans and the history of Tuggey&rsquo;s firm representing the Bexar County Republican Party and GOP candidates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the second part of Mercer&#39;s advertising statement doesn&#39;t add up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor starters, Mercer doesn&#39;t back up his presumption that every Democrat hews to the party&#39;s platform. It also doesn&#39;t stand to reason that support for same-sex marriage amounts to non-support of traditional marriage, as Mercer said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Mercer&#39;s favor: Both the state and national Democratic Party platforms signal Democratic support for abortion rights. But the 2008 state platform doesn&#39;t address same-sex marriage while the national platform backs equal protections for same-sex couples with no reference to marriage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMercer accurately tallied Tuggey&#39;s donations to Democrats, but made sweeping judgments unsupported by facts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his statement as Barely True.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n\t<i>Editor&#39;s note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
