He said 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of NRA members support background checks of gun purchasers.

It recruits participants randomly via mail and telephone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The poll found that 74 percent (to be precise, 73.7 percent) of NRA members supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. (The margin of error was seven points.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This poll was the most on point that we could find in terms of Taylor&rsquo;s claim. But we would also note two others done around the same time that included information<strong> </strong>on NRA households -- in other words, the person responding to the survey or someone in that household was an NRA member at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/120711121/CBS-News-New-York-Times-Poll\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>CBS News/New York Times poll</u></a>, also from January 2013, found that background checks on all potential gun buyers were favored by 85 percent of NRA households.

But as an organization, it opposes universal background checks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days after Taylor issued her statement, the NRA urged its members to oppose newly introduced legislation in Congress that would extend background checks to cover gun transactions at gun shows, over the Internet and in other settings. The <a href=\"https://www.nraila.org/articles/20150314/anti-gun-universal-background-check-bill-reintroduced\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>statement</u></a> on the NRA website said the federal bill &quot;does not address the real problems of fixing the broken mental health system and prosecuting criminals. Further, criminals will never submit to such a system so it will never truly be &lsquo;universal.&rsquo;&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taylor said polling shows that nearly 74 percent of National Rifle Association members &quot;support requiring background checks for all gun sales.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most recent national poll of NRA members that we could find, done in January 2013 by Johns Hopkins University, found that 73.7 percent of the members supported requiring background checks for all gun sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Taylor&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Update:</strong>&nbsp;After this item was published, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker called us contending that the Johns Hopkins poll could not accurately survey NRA members because only the NRA has access to the list of current, dues-paying members. We are not adjusting our rating, as it is a common practice in polling to ask respondents to identify whether they are members of, for example, a political party or other group.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-03-17T15:25:40.329898", "ruling_date": "2015-03-18T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Lena Taylor: Most NRA members back background checks on all gun purchases", "ruling_headline_slug": "most-nra-members-back-background-checks-all-gun-pu", "ruling_link_text": "Accurately cites latest poll", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>State Sen.
