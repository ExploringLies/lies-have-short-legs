As of 2010, 67.4 percent of the city&rsquo;s 21,000 residents are black, and 29.3 percent are white.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state of Missouri, by comparison, is 83 percent white and 11 percent black.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ferguson&rsquo;s black population was almost nonexistent four decades ago, when <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/14/ferguson-police-department-details/14064451/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>99 percent</u></a> of the population in 1970 was white, Census <a href=\"http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/39204513p18ch09.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>data show</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ferguson Police Chief <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-missouri-st-louis-police-shooting-teen-20140811-story.html#page=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Thomas Jackson, who is white, said</u></a> the police department has 53 officers, three of whom are black, according to the <em>Los Angeles Times </em>and the Associated Press. He also said that the other 50 officers are white, according to newspaper reports.&nbsp;Put another way, Ferguson police officers are 94 percent white and 5.6 percent black.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Timothy Zoll, a spokesman for the Ferguson Police Department, said Sunday that there actually are four African-American officers among the 53-person officer corps.&nbsp;&quot;The discrepancy may have been that we really don&#39;t see black or white among our colleagues,&quot; Zoll said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So there is some question whether the number is three or four, but there is no question that an imbalance exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ferguson Mayor James Knowles, who is also white, has addressed the lack of diversity in the police department. According to an Aug. 12 report by St. Louis-based TV station <a href=\"http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-department-diversity-questioned-officers/13976879/\" style=\"line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;\"><u>KSDK</u></a>, Knowles told reporters that young African-Americans aren&rsquo;t interested in police jobs. Knowles said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;We hire everyone that we can get. There&#39;s also the problem that a lot of young African-American people don&#39;t want to go into law enforcement. They already have this disconnect with law enforcement, so if we find people who want to go into law enforcement who are African-American we&#39;re all over it because we want them to help us bridge the gap.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lack of racial diversity on the police force compared with&nbsp;the city population is not unique to Ferguson. It&rsquo;s actually comparable to other cities its size around the country. A <a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/lpd07.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2007 Department of Justice survey</u> </a>of local police departments found the national average for all local police was 75 percent white. The average for an agency serving a city around Ferguson&rsquo;s population was 87.5 percent white.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Missouri law requires the state&rsquo;s attorney general to issue an <a href=\"http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>annual Vehicle Stops Report</u></a> detailing demographic information for people pulled over by officers in each city. In 2013, the attorney general&rsquo;s office reported that black drivers in Ferguson were about twice as likely to be arrested after police stops than whites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blacks made up 93 percent of 2013 arrests after car stops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mitchell said Ferguson has &quot;three black officers and 50 white officers with a town that is 67 percent African-American.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This claim has emerged as a central talking point in the fallout from Brown&rsquo;s shooting. Her numbers are backed up by news reports quoting the city&#39;s police chief&nbsp;and Census data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only caveat is that a police spokesman now says that the department has four African-Americans, while the chief previously has said three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this&nbsp;claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-17T14:33:13.808601", "ruling_date": "2014-08-17T16:57:30", "ruling_headline": "Ferguson, Mo., has 50 white police officers, three black officers, NBC's Mitchell claims", "ruling_headline_slug": "ferguson-police-department-has-50-white-officers-t", "ruling_link_text": "Mayor says recruiting African-American officers is tough", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview with Timothy Zoll, Ferguson police department spokesman, Aug. 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S.<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/29/2923986.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Census Bureau QuickFacts</u></a> for Ferguson, Mo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>USA Today,</em> &quot;<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/14/ferguson-police-department-details/14064451/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>5 things to know about Ferguson Police Department,</u></a>&quot; Aug. 14, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vox, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/8/12/5994181/ferguson-is-67-percent-black-and-its-police-force-is-94-percent-white\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Ferguson is 67 percent black and its police force is 94 percent white,</u></a>&quot; Aug. 12, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New Republic</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119070/michael-browns-death-leads-scrutiny-ferguson-white-police\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Ferguson&rsquo;s police force is 94 percent white -- and that&rsquo;s basically normal in the U.S.</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 13, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KSDK.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/12/ferguson-police-department-diversity-questioned-officers/13976879/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Ferguson police department diversity questioned,</u></a>&quot; Aug. 12, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Los Angeles Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-missouri-st-louis-police-shooting-teen-20140811-story.html#page=1%20\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Protesters and police face off in St. Louis suburb over shooting</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/police-stops-in-ferguson-what-are-the-numbers/article_012cf751-9cec-5733-8025-09e03abb9d86.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Police stops in Ferguson: What are the numbers?</u></a>&quot; Aug. 12, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Missouri Attorney General, 2013 <a href=\"http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/2013/reports/161.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>racial profiling statistics</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/police-chief-naacp-leader-predict-calmer-minds-would-prevail-in-tampa/2193226\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Police chief, NAACP leader predict calmer minds would prevail in Tampa,</u></a>&quot; Aug. 15, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Andrea", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 2619, "last_name": "Mitchell", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "andrea-mitchell", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/0523_wharton_630x420.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2619/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>In Ferguson, Mo.,&nbsp;&quot;you&#39;ve got three&nbsp;black officers and 50 white officers with a town that is 67 percent African-American.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an episode of NBC's \"Meet the Press\"", "statement_date": "2014-08-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 38, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/38/", "subject": "Crime", "subject_slug": "crime", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 173, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/173/", "subject": "Public Safety", "subject_slug": "public-safety", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/9/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
