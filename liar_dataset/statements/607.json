Barack Obama intends to raise pretty much all your taxes, while Sen. John McCain will leave them alone. The problem is that most of the e-mail's detailed assertions are false.\n<p>\n Here, we'll look at the e-mail's claims about McCain and the estate tax, which it refers to as the inheritance tax. For an examination of the e-mail's other claims, read\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2008/aug/04/return-tax-attack-chain-e-mail/\">\n  our full article here\n </a>\n .\n</p>\n<p>\n The e-mail claims that President George W. Bush \"repealed\" the estate tax, and it now stands at 0 percent. Though Bush reduced the tax, he did not repeal it. Rather, under his 2001 tax cut package, the estate tax reduces every year and then goes away for just a single year &mdash; 2010 &mdash; before reverting back to higher rates. (See the nonpartisan\n <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/estatetax.cfm\">\n  Tax Policy Center on estate taxes\n </a>\n for more details.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Currently, the estate tax generally applies only to estates worth more than $2-million (or $4-million for couples). Above those amounts, the tax rate tops out at 45 percent. Both Obama and McCain support renewing the current estate tax with a few changes. McCain proposes to increase the exemption to $5-million ($10-million for couples) and reduce the tax rate to 15 percent. Obama proposes to increase the exemption to $3.5-million ($7-million for couples) and leave the top rate at 45 percent.\n</p>\n<p>\n Although the e-mail captures the broad idea that McCain wants to reduce estate taxes more than Obama, it is wrong when it says McCain wants a \"0 percent\" estate tax, and it's also wrong that the estate tax is at zero percent now. We rate this statement False.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:08.469635", "ruling_date": "2008-08-04T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Larger estates will be taxed, just like now", "ruling_headline_slug": "larger-estates-will-be-taxed-just-like-now", "ruling_link_text": "Larger estates will be taxed, just like now", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Tax Policy Center,\n<a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/411741_updated_candidates.pdf\">\n An Updated Analysis of the 2008 Presidential Candidates' Tax Plans\n</a>\n, July 23, 2008\n<p>\n Tax Policy Center,\n <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/estatetax.cfm\">\n  Estate and Gift Taxes\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Fake_news", "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "", "false_count": 44, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "", "id": 27, "last_name": "Chain email", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "chain-email", "pants_count": 106, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-emailer.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/27/", "total_count": 180, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "John McCain will keep the estate tax at 0 percent, the same as it is now. <p>", "statement_context": "a chain e-mail", "statement_date": "2008-07-23", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": null}
