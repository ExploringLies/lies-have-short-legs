So there was that one bill,&quot; Mattiello said. &quot;Most of the business, and I don&#39;t want to be fact-checked, but I think by 11 o&#39;clock 95 to 98 percent of the business was done. So we really didn&#39;t have that late-night session. We were just holding on one bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(He was referring to legislation, later signed by Governor Chafee, authorizing referenda on whether table games should be allowed at the slot parlor.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mattiello may not have wanted to be fact-checked, but we couldn&rsquo;t resist, because we had a very different recollection of a legislative day that didn&#39;t officially end until 4:06 &nbsp;Saturday morning. The last vote was at 3:48 in the morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So was 95 to 98 percent of the business done by 11 p.m.? Was only one bill at issue? And did the House not really have a late-night session?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted Mattiello&#39;s office, spokesman Larry Berman said in an email that &quot;There were 126 votes taken by House members on the final day of session (June 20). Of those, 87 were made before 11 p.m.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s 69 percent, not 95 to 98 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Berman said, Mattiello was referring to <em>new</em> business. Most of those after-11-p.m. votes don&#39;t count, he argued, because all but one of those issues had already been debated before by the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s a distinction the speaker didn&#39;t make on Newsmakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The remaining votes did consist largely of cleaning up language so House and Senate versions were identical on bills that <a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText14/SenateText14/S2804.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>allowed optometrists to prescribe the opiate drug hydrocodone</u></a>; <a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText14/HouseText14/H7131A.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>regulated music therapists</u></a>; <a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText14/SenateText14/S2292.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>authorized special license plates for Olympic medal winners</u></a>, and <a href=\"http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText/BillText14/HouseText14/H8072A.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>eliminated the so-called master level that provides for straight-party voting</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But those are still final votes on important issues. Those votes are not insignificant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when you don&#39;t leave the building until after 4 a.m., that&#39;s a late night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nicholas Mattiello said that &quot;by 11 o&#39;clock 95 to 98 percent of the business was done. So we really didn&#39;t have that late-night session. We were just holding on one bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s true that one issue -- Newport Grand and its associated bills -- was holding things up on the last night of the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s much less true that 95 percent of the business was done by 11 p.m.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Mattiello&#39;s suggestion that you shouldn&#39;t call a 4 a.m. adjournment a late-night session simply because most votes involved legislation that members had seen before strikes us as Pants On Fire ridiculous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His statement contains just enough truth -- the fact that one bill was at issue -- to escape having his slacks scorched. We rule it False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>PolitiFact Rhode Island</u></a> to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
