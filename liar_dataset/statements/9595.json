Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, says increased demand for nursing home care is a major reason why the Virginia&rsquo;s Medicaid costs have soared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&rsquo;re living longer than ever and you have to spend down until you get to $2,000 of assets before you qualify for (Medicaid funded) nursing home care in our state,&quot; Sickles said in a recent floor speech. &quot;$2,000. That&rsquo;s where the money goes. That&rsquo;s where 70 percent of the money goes in our Medicaid program &ndash; to help our seniors live with skilled nursing who need it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start by noting that Sickles is correct is saying that Virginia&rsquo;s Medicaid will only pay for nursing home care to elderly and disabled people whose total financial resources don&rsquo;t exceed $2,000. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we want to explore in this Truth-O-Meter is Sickle&rsquo;s claim that 70 percent of the state&rsquo;s Medicaid money goes to provide elderly care in nursing homes. The statement comes amid a partisan battle over whether expand Medicaid to up to 400,000 additional low-income Virginians. Under Obamacare, the federal government would always pay at least 90 percent of the tab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GOP-led General Assembly blocked the expansion last month, saying Washington can&rsquo;t be trusted to pay its promised shares. Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, is exploring whether he can broaden the program without legislators&rsquo; consent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sickles told us he can&rsquo;t recall the exact source of his nursing home claim but, as a long time member of the Health, Welfare and Institutions Committee, he&rsquo;s often heard that 70 percent of the Medicaid money goes to 30 percent of the recipients. He said he understood that trend was &quot;largely caused&quot; by seniors in nursing homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Craig Markva, a spokesman for the Department of Medical Assistance Services, which runs the state&rsquo;s Medicaid program, gave us a different explanation. He said 70 percent of the money is spent on the medical expenses of all elderly and disabled patients, who comprise 32 percent of Virginia&rsquo;s Medicaid recipients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markva sent us Medicaid statistics for the budget year that ended June 30, 2013 -- the latest numbers available. They show that of the slightly more than 1 million Medicaid enrollees in Virginia, only 22,513 -- or 2.2 percent -- were seniors in nursing facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of a $6.7 billion Medicaid budget that fiscal year, the state spent $648 million to care for seniors in nursing homes. That boils down to 9.7 percent of the money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All told, seniors <a href=\"http://www.dmas.virginia.gov/Content_atchs/atchs/va-medprg.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>accounted</u></a> for about 7 percent of Virginia&rsquo;s Medicaid recipients during the 2012-13 budget year and received about 17 percent of the funds, or slightly more than $1.1 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Our ruling</strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sickles said that 70 percent of the state&rsquo;s Medicaid spending goes to seniors in nursing homes. He&rsquo;s way off; only 9.7 percent of the money goes to that cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-07-14T14:12:58.267157", "ruling_date": "2014-07-14T14:09:10", "ruling_headline": "Sickles says 70 percent of Virginia's Medicaid cost is for seniors in nursing homes", "ruling_headline_slug": "sickles-says-70-percent-virginias-medicaid-cost-se", "ruling_link_text": "Try less than 10 percent", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Del.
