Trump also accused Clinton of wanting to approve a newer proposal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/business/trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal-is-reached.html?_r=0\">largest regional trade deal in history</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NAFTA was bad, Trump said, &quot;And now you want to approve (the) Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, &#39;I can&#39;t win that debate.&#39; But you know that if you did win, you would approve that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said that &quot;is just not accurate&quot; and argued that she decided to oppose it once the terms of the deal were known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said she had praised the deal &quot;and then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Well, Donald,&quot; Clinton responded, &quot;I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered about the timing. Did Clinton change her mind in response to Trump&#39;s criticism of the TPP?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found no evidence to support Trump&#39;s claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even before he was a candidate, Trump was <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/23/news/economy/trump-trade-deal/\">on record as opposing</a> the TPP. As early as April 2015, he predicted it would hurt U.S. businesses and put people out of work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The terms of the deal were <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/business/trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal-is-reached.html?_r=0\">finalized on Oct. 5, 2015</a>. Clinton <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/07/politics/hillary-clinton-opposes-tpp/\">announced her opposition on Oct. 7</a>, two days later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, she was under pressure to oppose the pact, but that pressure wasn&#39;t from Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Oct. 7, Trump was <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-republican-field-dwindled-from-17-to-donald-trump/\">only one of 15 Republicans</a> still seeking the GOP nomination. The first presidential primary was five months away, Trump&#39;s poll numbers among Republicans were <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html?utm_source=hootsuite\">around 23 percent</a>. Many people thought his lead in the polls was largely based on name recognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most Republicans supported the deal, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/07/politics/hillary-clinton-opposes-tpp/\">CNN reported</a> in a story about Clinton&#39;s decision to oppose the TPP. Trump is listed as a notable exception. However, the topic didn&#39;t even come up during the first two GOP debates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More urgently, if Clinton was under any immediate pressure to oppose the TPP it was from her two top opponents in the Democratic primary &mdash; Bernie Sanders and Martin O&#39;Malley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like many Democrats, particularly those with strong union ties, both men opposed the TPP. Sanders called it &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/business/trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal-is-reached.html?_r=0\">disastrous</a>.&quot; O&#39;Malley accused Clinton of switching on the eve of the first Democratic debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, Sanders was starting to gain momentum. His support in the polls had gone from 12 percent at the end of June <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html\">to 25 percent</a> in a Clinton-Sanders matchup, and support for Clinton had slipped nearly 20 points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was also pressure from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Her biggest concern, as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/YmLHwZkonwY\">she explained</a> in a July 7, 2016 video, was that the TPP gave multinational companies special power &quot;to challenge a country&#39;s laws they just don&#39;t like,&quot; including laws on pollution, safety, health and food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We emailed a half dozen people in the Trump campaign seeking evidence that Trump&#39;s opposition caused Clinton to change her mind. We didn&#39;t hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump told Clinton, &quot;You heard what I said about (the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal), and all of a sudden you were against it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s no evidence for cause and effect here, and the Trump campaign hasn&#39;t provided any.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton says her opposition is based solely on the terms of the proposed pact and her announcement to oppose it came two days after the TPP was finalized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if political considerations drove her decision, most of the pressure on Clinton was within her own party, particularly from Bernie Sanders, as she saw her support among Democrats slipping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the available evidence, we rate Trump&#39;s claim as False.</p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/eef8af26-f463-4b75-ad92-d01bd602af43\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/eef8af26-f463-4b75-ad92-d01bd602af43</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-27T16:36:03.294028", "ruling_date": "2016-09-27T17:14:54", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump: My Trans-Pacific Partnership opposition made Hillary Clinton change her stance", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-my-trans-pacific-partnership-oppositi", "ruling_link_text": "What about Bernie?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/06/annotated-transcript-the-aug-6-gop-debate/\">Annotated transcript: The Aug. 6 GOP debate</a>,&quot; Aug. 6, 2015; &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/16/annotated-transcript-september-16-gop-debate/\">Wednesday&#39;s GOP debate transcript, annotated</a>,&quot; Sept. 16, 2015; and &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/26/the-first-trump-clinton-presidential-debate-transcript-annotated/\">The first Trump-Clinton presidential debate transcript, annotated</a>,&quot; Sept. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/business/trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal-is-reached.html?_r=0\">Trans-Pacific Partnership Is Reached, but Faces Scrutiny in Congress</a>,&quot; Oct. 5, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/23/news/economy/trump-trade-deal/\">Donald Trump slams Pacific free trade deal</a>,&quot; April 23, 2015 and &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/07/politics/hillary-clinton-opposes-tpp/\">Hillary Clinton comes out against TPP trade deal</a>,&quot; Oct. 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FiveThirtyEight, &quot;<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-republican-field-dwindled-from-17-to-donald-trump/\">How The Republican Field Dwindled From 17 to Donald Trump</a>,&quot; May 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RealClear Politics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html?utm_source=hootsuite\">RCP Poll Average; 2016 Republican Presidential Nomination</a>,&quot; and &quot;<a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html\">RCP Poll Average; 2016 Democratic Presidential Nomination</a>,&quot; accessed Sept. 27, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, &quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/YmLHwZkonwY\">Sen.
