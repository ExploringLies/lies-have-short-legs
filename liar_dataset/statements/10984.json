Scott Walker is touting his record on veterans as he tours the country preparing to make a presidential bid. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a &quot;Politics and Pies&quot; event May 30, 2015 in New Hampshire, Walker boasted of the success veterans have had finding jobs in Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nationally the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate,&quot; Walker said, adding Wisconsin is &quot;one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are Wisconsin veterans doing that well in the Wisconsin job market? &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To support his claim, Walker&#39;s team sent a <a href=\"http://dwd.wi.gov/dwd/newsreleases/2015/150318_veterans_ui_rate.htm\">report</a> from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics about veteran and non-veteran employment. This is the best way to make the comparison, as opposed to measuring veterans vs the overall workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it breaks down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The national picture: </strong>Walker said &quot;nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the national unemployment rate for veterans is actually lower than the rate for non-veterans. For veterans, the rate was 5.3 percent, compared to 6 percent for non-veterans. That&#39;s true historically as well. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.va.gov/vetdata/docs/SpecialReports/Employment_Rates_FINAL.pdf\">report</a> from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs shows that from 2000 to 2013, veterans had lower unemployment rates than non-veterans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Wisconsin picture:</strong> Walker also said in Wisconsin &quot;unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin&#39;s rate for veterans was 4.1 percent while the rate for non-veterans was 5.4 percent. So, the state&#39;s veterans are employed at higher rates than their civilian counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How rare is it?</strong> In his claim, Walker said Wisconsin&rsquo;s situation was a &quot;rare&quot; one. But 32 other states also had veteran unemployment rates lower than non-veterans. That&rsquo;s not all that rare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wisconsin vs. national:</strong> Finally, Walker said Wisconsin&#39;s veteran unemployment rate was &quot;certainly lower than it is nationally.&quot; &nbsp;Federal data confirms this aspect of the claim, with Wisconsin&#39;s veteran unemployment rate at 4.1 percent, while nationally the rate was 5.3 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the data he provided supported two of the four aspects to his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More about the data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comparing the fraction of vets who are unemployed in the state to the fraction of unemployed vets nationally makes sense, said Steven Deller, a professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But unemployment rates don&rsquo;t necessarily <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/osmr/pdf/ec090020.pdf\">show the whole picture</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data takes an average from the last year&rsquo;s monthly Current Population Survey of 60,000 households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People who have worked at a regular job in the previous week are considered employed, while people who are jobless, looking for a job and available for work are considered unemployed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the approach doesn&rsquo;t account for workers who are underemployed or employed outside their field, and doesn&rsquo;t take into account discouraged workers who stopped looking for a job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BLS does calculate other unemployment rates, though they are not often cited by politicians or the media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One is known as the U-6, which takes the total of the unemployed, all persons marginally attached to the labor force and involuntary part-time workers. A rule of thumb puts the U-6 rate as double the conventional unemployment rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U-6 rate for Wisconsin is 12.1, while the national rate is 13.8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BLS economist Steve Hipple calculated an estimated U-6 rate for veterans nationally at 9.7 percent. BLS doesn&rsquo;t publish state U-6 rates specifically for veterans, .</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said &quot;Nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate,&quot; and Wisconsin is &quot;one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data from BLS supported two of the four aspects of his claim and experts cautioned about use of raw statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our definition for Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-06-23T12:42:09.473015", "ruling_date": "2015-06-23T11:41:27", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker says Wisconsin fares better than nation on veteran unemployment", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-says-wisconsin-fares-better-nation-ve", "ruling_link_text": "The bag is mixed", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/vet.pdf\">Employment situation of veterans-2014</a>, March 18,2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone conversation with Nicholas Aakre, economist, Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 15, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Steven Durlauf, professor, University of Wisconsin</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United States Department of Veterans Affairs, <a href=\"http://www.va.gov/vetdata/docs/SpecialReports/Employment_Rates_FINAL.pdf\">Veterans employment 2000-2013</a>, December 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email Exchange with Steven Deller, professor, department of agricultural and applied economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Labor, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/osmr/pdf/ec090020.pdf\">Measure of labor underutilization from the Current Population Survey</a>, March, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone conversation with Steve Hipple, economist, Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 18, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/lau/stalt.htm\">Alternative measures of labor underutilization for states</a>, April 24, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 38, "current_job": "Milwaukee County Executive", "false_count": 42, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 38, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 640, "last_name": "Walker", "mostly_true_count": 44, "name_slug": "scott-walker", "pants_count": 11, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Scott_Walker_1_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/640/", "total_count": 211, "true_count": 25, "website": "http://www.scottwalker.org/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate,&quot; and Wisconsin is &quot;one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech in New Hampshire", "statement_date": "2015-05-30", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 51, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/51/", "subject": "Veterans", "subject_slug": "veterans", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
