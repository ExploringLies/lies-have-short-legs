Last year the Milken Institute ranked San Antonio as the nation&#39;s top-performing local economy.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCastro made the same claim in his keynote at the Texas Democratic Party convention. In that June 8, 2012, speech -- which we&rsquo;ve previously dipped into <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/julian-castro/\">twice</a> -- Juli&aacute;n Castro said his city&rsquo;s investments in infrastructure and education paid off &quot;late last year when San Antonio was ranked as the top-performing local economy by the Milken Institute.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, we confirmed, San Antonio topped Milken&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://bestcities.milkeninstitute.org/\">2011 list</a> of the nation&rsquo;s best-performing large metropolitan areas, rocketing up from 14th place the year before. Its rise is part of a recent trend in which Texas cities have dominated the list as the nation recovers from the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-39740853/nber-the-recession-ended-in-june-2009/\">2007-09</a> recession.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe economic think tank&rsquo;s annual list, which Milken spokesman Conrad Kiechel told us by phone has been issued in its current form for &quot;more than a decade,&quot; was described in a Dec. 30, 2011, <em>Texas Tribune</em> <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/texas-economy/economy/san-antonio-grows-so-does-its-confidence/\">news story</a> as &quot;a ranking that measures American metropolitan areas based on their ability to create and sustain jobs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilken&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.milkeninstitute.org/pdf/BPC2011.pdf\">2011 report</a> on the best-performing cities says the index gives priority to job and pay gains, then some weight to several technology measures in relation to national averages: the local growth in high-tech gross domestic product, the concentration of tech industries and how many of 25 specific tech industries are concentrated there. Some measures are weighed across five-year spans, to flatten out extreme swings, and the most recent year, &quot;to capture recent momentum.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<center>\r\n\t<img height=\"307\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/yH0luQDmSx2MZ3qrmAd2MeOOyzeiLpfnmIEgPq1rLv1AWjfFbkfsg_Rs234oChMHL6Q1SH1WZ7eiY_jTJ512-w1Jw0gN9xhmbmQVYpZIg0GXNq0QlsM\" width=\"434\" /></center>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn recent years, the <em>Tribune </em>said, &quot;companies have flocked to San Antonio, making it an economic center rivaling Houston and Dallas.&quot; In contrast to those cities, though, &quot;San Antonio has attracted high-wage jobs, capitalizing on its booming medical research industry.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <em>Tribune </em>story said InCube and Medtronic were the latest bioscience companies to move to San Antonio, which was already home to global headquarters for Valero Energy, Clear Channel Communications, USAA insurers and the H-E-B grocery chain.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <em>San Antonio Express-News</em> credited the city&rsquo;s rise to reasons &quot;including military base realignment, drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale and the growth of health care&quot; in a <a href=\"http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/S-A-is-named-nation-s-top-performing-city-2405315.php\">Dec. 16, 2011, news story</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTexas cities held four of the top five spots on Milken&rsquo;s 2011 big-cities list, with Austin/Round Rock at fourth.
