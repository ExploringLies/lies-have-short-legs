But then the 71-year-old senator launched into a defense of the Swedish pop band ABBA.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"Everybody says, 'I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.' How come everybody goes to\n <i>\n  Mamma Mia!\n </i>\n ?\" McCain said. \"Everybody goes! They've been selling out for years.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n We wondered if McCain was right that\n <i>\n  Mamma Mia!,\n </i>\n the musical based on ABBA's recordings, has been \"selling out for years.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n First, we will assume that McCain was referring to the stage version, which has been playing on Broadway since 2001, not the movie version, which opened this summer.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Broadway show's Web site says the stage production, which has been performed in eight languages, has been seen by more than 30-million people in over 170 cities. The Web site calls it \"the ultimate feel-good show.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n And McCain seems to be keeping up with Broadway box office receipts. TicketNews, which tracks Broadway receipts, reports that\n <i>\n  Mamma Mia!\n </i>\n is still selling out. For example, it sold out its performances the weeks ending Aug. 3 and Aug. 10, selling about 101 percent of its seats (the number exceeds 100 because it includes standing-room tickets). A survey of other weeks in the past year found the show nearly sold out or exceeded capacity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Alfred Branch Jr., news editor of TicketNews, told us that the show is \"a virtual sellout most nights.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n So McCain is right that\n <i>\n  Mamma Mia\n </i>\n has been selling out for years. This claim is True.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:06.979735", "ruling_date": "2008-08-15T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "McCain knows ABBA", "ruling_headline_slug": "mccain-knows-abba", "ruling_link_text": "McCain knows ABBA", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "New York Times Caucus blog,\n<a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/15/mccain-in-colorado/\">\n McCain in Colorado,\n</a>\nAug. 15, 2008\n<p>\n Mamma Mia!
