Routinely? That got our attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Facebook, a few firefighters pushed back on Kovac&rsquo;s claim, saying they have not seen a raise in two or three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nic, where are you getting 4% annually?&quot; a Fire Department employee commented. &quot;This is not just misleading, it&rsquo;s wrong.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the real numbers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Kovac for backup, he said he spoke off the cuff with the TV reporter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In doing so, he misspoke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After checking the recent history of raises with the city budget office, Kovac said he should not have said &quot;routine&quot; or &quot;annual&quot; in regards to 4 percent raises for police and fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maria Monteagudo, the city&rsquo;s employee relations director, sent us the base pay increases for city employees back to 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the percentage raises from 2010 to present.

But that was a one-year blip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that exception, across-the-board raises have been small or nonexistent for all city employees dating to 2010, the year before Act 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One important note: For 2013 and 2014, public safety employees have not yet negotiated a contract with the city. So while they have received nothing so far, they could still receive raises retroactively once a contract agreement is reached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>General city workers and managers received small raises for those two years. That was done without collective bargaining for most of those workers, because the largest labor union representing city employees was not recertified under Act 10 rules, Monteagudo said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before 2010, city employees of all types typically got 2 percent to 3 percent raises with small variations. Unionized workers typically were around the top of that range, with non-represented managers closer to the low end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the union ranks since 2007, police and fire raises have outstripped those for general workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mandatory furloughs, including of police and fire workers, have cut further into pay.
