That includes a requirement that nearly all people buy health insurance and the creation of insurance &quot;exchanges&quot; where people can buy health insurance, in some cases with a federal subsidy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t-- As PolitiFact National noted in a similar claim made by Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, the law is expected to increase the number of people with health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, projects the number of uninsured Americans will be 29 million to 31 million lower than it would otherwise be without the law.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAsked to back the claim, Hovde campaign press secretary Sean Lansing cited Congressional Budget Office projections, as well as a news article about two national surveys of employers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Congressional Budget Office</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLansing said the CBO projected in a March 2012 <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/03-15-ACA_and_Insurance_2.pdf\">report</a> that as many as 20 million Americans will lose their employer-provided coverage after the health reform law takes full effect.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that&rsquo;s the worst-case of a series of scenarios presented by the budget office; in another scenario, the number of people who get employer-provided health insurance actually increases by 3 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s important is the budget office&rsquo;s baseline estimate, or best guess, which is that 3 million to 5 million fewer people in each year from 2019 through 2022 will get health insurance through an employer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut, to be clear, that does not mean they won&rsquo;t have access to insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Employer surveys</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLansing provided an August 2011 Associated Press <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/story/2011-08-24/Survey-Almost-10-of-employers-may-end-health-insurance/50120998/1\">article</a> that reported on two national surveys of employers. Both were conducted by benefits consultants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA Towers Watson survey found that nearly 1 in 10 midsize or large employers expect to stop offering health coverage to workers once federal insurance exchanges start in 2014. And a Mercer survey of large and smaller employers found that 8 percent were either &quot;likely&quot; or &quot;very likely&quot; to end health benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, potentially millions of workers could lose their employer-provided health insurance as a result of the reform law. Lansing argues that means those workers would be denied access to affordable health insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that&rsquo;s not the whole story.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder the law, workers whose employers stop offering health insurance would have other options.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs our colleagues noted in the Priebus item, which was rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/23/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-health-care-law-could-mean-man/\">Half True</a>:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The people who lose insurance this way won&rsquo;t, for the most part, be left without insurance options. They should have access to coverage on the exchanges, perhaps with subsidies. And depending on their income level, they may have access to Medicaid or the State Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Plan, which were expanded as part of the law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Indeed, health care experts say that a big reason why companies may drop coverage is specifically because their employees will be able to go onto the exchanges and get guaranteed, and in many cases, subsidized coverage.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut there&#39;s an even more important point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde&rsquo;s claim is that the law itself denies the access to affordable care. In the scenarios he cites, it is the employer who would be deciding to drop the employer-sponsored plan. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde said Obama&rsquo;s health care reform law denies &quot;millions of Americans access to affordable&quot; health insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnce the law takes full effect, some employers are expected to stop providing health insurance to their employees. But that&#39;s not the same as the law denying people access to affordable health insurance, particularly since other options for obtaining such insurance will be available.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Hovde&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-05T15:39:26.029649", "ruling_date": "2012-04-08T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Newcomer and Wisconsin GOP Senate candidate Eric Hovde says \"Obamacare\" denies millions \"access to affordable insurance\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "newcomer-and-wisconsin-gop-senate-candidate-eric-h", "ruling_link_text": "Options available even if employers drop coverage", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPatch.com, Eric Hovde <a href=\"http://brookfield-wi.patch.com/blog_posts/huge-day-in-the-supreme-court\">blog post</a>, March 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview and email interview, Hovde campaign press secretary Sean Lansing, March 29 and April 3, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact.com, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/26/senate-republican-conference/senate-republican-web-video-attacks-barack-obama-s/\">&quot;Senate Republican web video attacks Barack Obama, saying he increased health care premiums,&quot;</a> March 26, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact.com, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/23/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-health-care-law-could-mean-man/\">&quot;Reince Priebus says health care law could mean &lsquo;as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance,&rsquo;&quot;</a> March 23, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/hovde-joins-republican-race-for-us-senate-gg4g9tm-142007043.html\">&quot;Hovde joins Republican race for U.S. Senate,&quot;</a> March 8, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/business/116519943.html\">&quot;Employers weigh next step in health care,&quot;</a> Feb. 19, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhiteHouse.gov, Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/healthreform/healthcare-overview#access\">&quot;Better access to care&quot;</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Affordable Care Act <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/law/timeline/index.html\">timeline</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/03-15-ACA_and_Insurance_2.pdf\">&quot;CBO and JCT&rsquo;s estimates of the effects of the Affordable Care Act,&quot;</a> March 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssociated Press, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/story/2011-08-24/Survey-Almost-10-of-employers-may-end-health-insurance/50120998/1\">&quot;Survey: Almost 10% of employers may end health insurance,&quot; </a>Aug. 24, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Barack Obama Wisconsin campaign press secretary Gillian Morris, April 4 and 5, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Eric", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "", "id": 1797, "last_name": "Hovde", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "eric-hovde", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Eric_Hovde_PFACT.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1797/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Obama health reform law denies millions &quot;access to affordable insurance.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a blog post", "statement_date": "2012-03-27", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
