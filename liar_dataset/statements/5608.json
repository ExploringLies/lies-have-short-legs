Fehrnstrom was asked why Romney&rsquo;s opponents, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, haven&rsquo;t endorsed him yet and how their far-right pressure on Romney will resonate with independent voters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s fair to say that John McCain was considerably a more moderate candidate than the ones that Gov. Romney faces now,&quot; said political comedian John Fugelsang. &quot;Is there a concern that the pressure from Santorum and Gingrich might force the governor to tack so far to right it would hurt him with moderate voters in the general election?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFehrnstrom answered, &quot;Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes. It&#39;s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and we start all over again.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs expected, Romney&rsquo;s opponents pounced. Gingrich and Santorum both held up the perennial children&rsquo;s toy as props at campaign appearances. Democrats cranked out ads capitalizing on the line, which provided an almost too-easy inroad to raising questions -- again -- about Romney&rsquo;s firmness on issues.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere we&rsquo;ll check <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/americanbridge21st\">one such ad</a>, put out by the Democratic super PAC <a href=\"http://www.americanbridgepac.org/\">American Bridge 21st Century</a>, which suggests that Romney has flip-flopped on abortion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>First, the toy</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn case you skipped childhood, we&rsquo;ll tell you a bit about the Etch A Sketch.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst manufactured in the 1950s, the <a href=\"http://www.ohioart.com/etch/\">Etch A Sketch</a> is a flat tablet with a red frame, gray face and two white knobs for drawing -- like an iPad from the paleolithic period. The two knobs draw vertical and horizontal lines on the screen as they&rsquo;re turned, and those with superior hand-eye coordination are said to be able to make curving lines. For most Etch A Sketchers, though, a side view of a staircase qualifies as a masterpiece.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe feature Fehrnstrom analogized was its reusability. When you&rsquo;re done drawing, you flip it over and shake it up. Little beads rattle around inside to clear the screen, and <em>Voila! </em>You once again have a blank canvas.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Now, the ad</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad was produced by American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC. In the ad, released the same day as Fehrnstrom&rsquo;s comment, a clip of his interview plays, including the Etch A Sketch comment. Then the toy appears, with the words &quot;Romney on the issues&quot; above it. Music that sounds like it&rsquo;s coming from a jack-in-the-box plays in the background.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first quote attributed to Romney appears on the Etch A Sketch screen: &quot;I support a woman&rsquo;s right to choose.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen the Etch A Sketch shakes, the words vanish and the next quote appears.<br class=\"kix-line-break\" />\r\n\t<br class=\"kix-line-break\" />\r\n\t&quot;I believe strongly in protecting life.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad goes on to portray Romney&rsquo;s apparent flip flops on the NRA and his loyalty to Ronald Reagan. (PolitiFact has looked into similar accusations before. See our checks <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/29/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-ad-quotes-mitt-romney-distancing-him/\">here</a> on the NRA and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/29/democratic-national-committee/dnc-calls-out-romneys-evolving-affection-reagan/\">here</a> on Reagan.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor this fact-check, we&rsquo;ll see if the two abortion quotes are accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found a <em>Boston Globe</em> story from May, 1994, when Romney was in a primary battle for U.S. Senate. At the time, he said he supported abortion rights and the right to privacy established by <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. But even then, opponents accused him of being a pro-choice pretender.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFollowing a debate with opponent John Lakian, Romney defended an endorsement he had received from Massachusetts&rsquo; state treasurer Joe Malone, an abortion opponent. Lakian had said Malone backed him &quot;to reward the pro-life contingent that was very much in Mitt&#39;s camp at the convention,&quot; according to the <em>Globe</em>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney responded: &quot;The idea that somehow Joe Malone endorsed me because he&#39;s pro-life despite the fact that I support a woman&#39;s right to choose doesn&#39;t follow very well.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s the only quote from Romney we found that matches American Bridge&rsquo;s ad verbatim. Numerous other statements he&rsquo;s made, however, express the same sentiment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor one, in a debate later in the 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, &quot;I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country.&quot; And, &quot;I believe that since <em>Roe v. Wade</em> has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tFor another, in his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, &quot;I will preserve and protect a woman&#39;s right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second Romney quote in American Bridge&rsquo;s ad reflects his changed stance on the issue. &quot;I believe strongly in protecting life,&quot; the ad says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe could find no instance of Romney saying those exact words. American Bridge&rsquo;s spokesman Chris Harris told us the quotes &quot;were paraphrased so they fit on a small Etch A Sketch screen. We ensured they were airtight, accurate portrayals of his positions, both past and present.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s well-documented that Romney&rsquo;s past and present positions on abortion differ from each other. In a June 18, 2011,<a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/269984/my-pro-life-pledge-mitt-romney\"> op-e</a><a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/269984/my-pro-life-pledge-mitt-romney\">d</a> in the conservative <em>National Review</em> Romney laid out his views:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, because it is bad law and bad medicine. <em>Roe</em> was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I believe people understand that I&#39;m firmly pro-life,&quot; he said in a debate that same month.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn October 2011 he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkrOt9Qposg\">told</a> former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Fox News, &quot;I&#39;d make sure that the progress that has been made to provide for life and to protect human life is not progress that would be reversed.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, we have examined Romney&rsquo;s shifting position on abortion when others have made the accusation. In each case, we rated the charge True. (Please see our source list.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmerican Bridge&rsquo;s ad suggests that Romney has been both an abortion rights supporter and an opponent. Using statements on an Etch A Sketch screen, the ad first portrays Romney as supporting abortion rights, then as opposing them. In other words, a flip flop.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe quotes in the ad accurately portray Romney&rsquo;s past and present stances, but the punctuation suggests they are his actual words. The second statement was not a literal quote, and that&rsquo;s worth noting, but it was a true reflection of Romney&#39;s position. According to our Truth-O-Meter, this ad passes muster. It&rsquo;s accurate and doesn&rsquo;t leave out anything important. We rate it True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-22T17:41:13.086447", "ruling_date": "2012-03-22T18:16:40", "ruling_headline": "PAC ad sketches Romney as abortion flip-flopper", "ruling_headline_slug": "pac-ad-sketches-romney-abortion-flip-flopper", "ruling_link_text": "For it before he was against it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.ohioart.com/etch/\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.19407254974507482\">Etch A Sketch website</a>, accessed March 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmerican Bridge ad, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/americanbridge21st\">Romney: the Etch A Sketch candidate</a>,&quot;
