Hillary Clinton) or on more school teachers (Sen. Barack Obama).\n</p>\n<p>\n In a speech on March 20, 2008, Obama took a different approach and emphasized the personal cost of the war.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"When Iraq is costing each household about $100 a month, you're paying a price for this war,\" he said in the speech in Charleston, W.Va.\n</p>\n<p>\n At $100 per month, the war cost to each U.S. household would be more than cable TV (average bill: $58), but less than a car payment (average bill: $400-500).\n</p>\n<p>\n We asked the Obama campaign about the source of the $100 figure and were told it came from\n <i>\n  The Three Trillion Dollar War,\n </i>\n a new book by Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, and Linda J. Bilmes, a former Commerce Department official from the Clinton administration who is now a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.\n</p>\n<p>\n The book says the monthly operating cost of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is about $16-billion.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"To think of it another way,\" the book says, \"roughly every American household is spending $138 per month on the current operating costs of the wars, with a little more than $100 per month going to Iraq alone.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n (Of course, Obama's simplified analysis does not reflect the variations in income tax levels. And you don't have to write a check for the war each month. The war costs are included in government spending that is paid for by taxes.)\n</p>\n<p>\n There was no footnote for the $100 estimate, so we called Bilmes to ask how she had calculated it. She said they took the Bush administration's 2008 request for war funding &ndash; $196-billion &ndash; and divided it by 12 to get a monthly cost. That works out to $16-billlion for both wars and about $12-billion just for the Iraq portion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then, she and Stiglitz divided those figures by the number of U.S. households and came up with $138 for both wars and slightly more than $100 for Iraq alone, she said.\n</p>\n<p>\n We double-checked the authors' sources and math, and found they were right.\n</p>\n<p>\n Indeed, the Bush administration request for 2008 was $196-billion for both wars, with $159-billion going to Iraq, according to a summary by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. A recent Census Bureau report said there were 116-million households. So that works out to about $140 per month for both wars and about $114 for Iraq alone. (Our numbers are slightly higher than Bilmes and Stiglitz because we used the latest estimates from CRS and a newer and slighter higher count for households.)\n</p>\n<p>\n To verify the Bilmes and Stiglitz calculation, we checked with Steven Kosiak, vice president for budget studies with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on defense issues. He said their methodology was correct and that the number \"sounds about right.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Bilmes, a Democrat who is neutral in the presidental race, said Obama could have used an even higher figure if he had included other war costs that aren't in the Pentagon's $196-billion tab. These include disability payments, the cost of replacing war-fighting equipment and interest on the borrowed money.\n</p>\n<p>\n By using the figure he did, Obama \"really was being conservative on this,\" Bilmes said. \"He's not overstating it in any way.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n And so we find Obama is right about the war's monthly cost. We find his claim to be True.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:19.722603", "ruling_date": "2008-04-01T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Yes, families pay more for Iraq war than cable", "ruling_headline_slug": "yes-families-pay-more-for-iraq-war-than-cable", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, families pay more for Iraq war than cable", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "CQ Transcripts, Sen.
