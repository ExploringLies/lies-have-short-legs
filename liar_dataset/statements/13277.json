Patrick Murphy questioned how Republican Sen. Marco Rubio could stand by Donald Trump at the first U.S. Senate debate, especially since Rubio attacked Trump throughout the Republican presidential primary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My opponent, Marco Rubio, made it clear: Not only does he think Donald Trump is a con man, he went on to say he doesn&#39;t trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes,&quot; Murphy said in Orlando on Oct. 17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy is right &mdash; Rubio has not held back in his words against Trump. On multiple occasions, Rubio referred to Trump as a con man or con artist and said he doesn&rsquo;t trust Trump with the nuclear codes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio did not deny the comments in his response, saying, &quot;I don&rsquo;t trust either one of them. And the job of a U.S. senator is not to blindly trust a president because they happen to be from your own party.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added later: &quot;I stand by everything I ever said in the Republican primary. And I would admit right off the bat this is not the most inspirational choice we&rsquo;ve ever had in American history in terms of these two candidates.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem, Rubio said, is Democrat Hillary Clinton is even less trustworthy with sensitive information than Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the candidates agree that Rubio trashed Trump but backs the nominee anyway. We ran down the quotes in question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio dubbed Trump a con on multiple occasions when he was vying for the Republican nomination. Most of the name-calling happened after a Feb. 25 GOP primary debate, as Rubio made the morning TV news rounds and attended rallies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio called Trump a con man four times in 15 seconds at a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw_LNuYUqc4\"> rally in Oklahoma City</a> on Feb. 26.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I will never stop until we keep a con man from taking over the party of Reagan and the conservative movement,&quot; Rubio said of Trump. &quot;He&rsquo;s a con man. He&#39;s a con man. He&rsquo;s a con man. I&#39;ll tell you why.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio, who was critical of Trump&rsquo;s business background, accused Trump of &quot;taking advantage&quot; of voters&rsquo; economic anxiety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there were Rubio&rsquo;s appearances on ABC&#39;s <em><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/marco-rubio-defends-combative-debate-style-con-artist/story?id=37216857\">Good Morning America</a></em>, NBC&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV1TrW3xqHo\"><em>Today</em> show</a> and CBS&rsquo; <em><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-hits-con-artist-donald-trump/\">This Morning</a></em>, all on Feb. 26.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A con artist is about to take over the Republican Party and the conservative movement, and we have to put a stop to it,&quot; Rubio said on CBS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that same interview, Rubio said he doesn&rsquo;t trust giving an &quot;erratic individual&quot; like Trump the nuclear codes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is the most important government job on the planet, and we&#39;re about to turn over the conservative movement to a person that has no ideas of any substance on the important issues &mdash; the nuclear codes of the United States &mdash; to an erratic individual &mdash; and the conservative movement &mdash; to someone who has spent a career sticking it to working people,&quot; Rubio <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-hits-con-artist-donald-trump/\">said</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy said Rubio &quot;made it clear, not only does he think Donald Trump is a con man, he&nbsp;went on to say he doesn&#39;t trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transcripts and Rubio himself confirm this claim. Rubio even told Monday&rsquo;s debate crowd he still doesn&rsquo;t trust Trump with the nuclear codes &mdash; he just distrusts Clinton more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Murphy&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6d61d798-0c97-4f59-b5c8-71091f7d51c6\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6d61d798-0c97-4f59-b5c8-71091f7d51c6</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-18T10:20:49.305618", "ruling_date": "2016-10-18T10:22:05", "ruling_headline": "Patrick Murphy right about Rubio not trusting Donald Trump with nuclear codes", "ruling_headline_slug": "patrick-murphy-right-about-marco-rubio-attacks-don", "ruling_link_text": "Rubio sticks by his attacks", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email exchange, Patrick Murphy campaign, Oct. 17, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw_LNuYUqc4\">Youtube</a>, &quot;Marco Rubio Calls Trump a &quot;Con Man&quot; 4 Times in 15 Seconds&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/marco-rubio-defends-combative-debate-style-con-artist/story?id=37216857\">ABC News</a>, &quot;Marco Rubio Defends His More Combative Debate Style Against &#39;Con Artist&rsquo;,&quot; Feb. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV1TrW3xqHo\">Today</a>, &quot;Marco Rubio: Donald Trump Is A &lsquo;Con Artist,&rsquo; &lsquo;We Must Put An End To This Lunacy&rsquo; | TODAY,&quot; Feb. 26, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-hits-con-artist-donald-trump/\">CBS <em>This Morning</em></a>, &quot;Marco Rubio hits &quot;con artist&quot; Donald Trump,&quot; Feb. 26, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Patrick", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 1373, "last_name": "Murphy", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "patrick-murphy", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/patrickmurphy.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1373/", "total_count": 15, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://patrickmurphy.house.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Marco Rubio made it clear: Not only does he think Donald Trump is a con man, he&nbsp;went on to say he doesn&#39;t trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a U.S. Senate debate in Orlando", "statement_date": "2016-10-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Patrick Murphy right about Marco Rubio attacks on Donald Trump "}
