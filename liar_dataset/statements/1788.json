His \"flippant response to homeowners in trouble,\" according to the Democrats, was, \"You can&rsquo;t do everything.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">We wondered if the Republican gubernatorial candidate was indeed so \"flip,\" especially at a time when mortgage flipping fraud was so pervasive in Florida. The state has ranked first nationwide in mortgage fraud every year since 2006.</span></p>\r\n<p>Indeed, we found the Democrats quoted him correctly.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">On July 25, 2009, the <em>Sarasota Herald-Tribune</em> ran a front-page article in which reporter Jeremy Wallace noted that McCollum had&nbsp;acknowledged that his agency hadn&rsquo;t done enough to stop more than 10,000 cases of potentially illegal real estate deals uncovered by the West Florida newspaper (the Democrats' campaign literature cites the <em>Herald-Tribune</em> article but gives an incorrect date of July 25, 2007). In the story, McCollum cited a lack of resources and his agency&rsquo;s limited jurisdiction over criminal mortgage fraud for his inability to do more.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">The newspaper noted that McCollum had formed a task force in 2007 to investigate mortgage fraud cases, but that other consumer issues took priority. And so when a Sarasota reporter asked McCollum in an interview in Venice why he hadn&rsquo;t done more on mortgage fraud prior, McCollum replied: \"It&rsquo;s not the only thing we do. You can&rsquo;t do everything.\" It's worth noting that McCollum gave his response to the <em>Herald-Tribune</em> &ndash; and, not as the Democrats say, to \"homeowners in trouble.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">Still, the Democrats were right about his words and quoted him accurately. We find their statement True. <br /></span></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-05-13T15:35:49.628025", "ruling_date": "2010-05-13T17:51:03", "ruling_headline": "Bill McCollum on curbing mortgage fraud: \"You can't do everything.\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-mccollum-curbing-mortgage-fraud-you-cant-do-e", "ruling_link_text": "That's what he said", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Florida Democratic Party, \"<a href=\"http://www.fladems.com/content/w/bill_mccollum_tries_to_gloss_over_lack_of_action_on_mortgage_fraud_with_ele\" target=\"_blank\">Bill McCollum Tries to Gloss Over Lack of Action on Mortgage Fraud with Election Year Workshop</a>,\" May 8, 2010<br /><br />The Sarasota Herald-Tribune, \"Flipping fraud: an issue avoided on the campaign trail?\" July 25, 2009, accessed via Nexis</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "", "false_count": 4, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 324, "last_name": "Florida Democratic Party", "mostly_true_count": 7, "name_slug": "florida-democratic-party", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Donkey.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/324/", "total_count": 31, "true_count": 4, "website": "http://www.fladems.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Bill McCollum explained his lack of action on mortgage fraud by saying, \"You can't do everything.\"</p>", "statement_context": "an e-mail press release", "statement_date": "2010-05-13", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 106, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/106/", "subject": "Housing", "subject_slug": "housing", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Bill", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 325, "last_name": "McCollum", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "bill-mccollum", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Bill_McCollum.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/325/", "total_count": 12, "true_count": 3, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": null}
