James Inhofe, R-Okla. \"Chu has unabashedly called coal &mdash; which generates over 50 percent of our nation&rsquo;s electricity &mdash; his 'worst nightmare.'\"\n</p>\n<p>\n We've never had nightmares about coal or any other fossil fuel, so we wondered whether Chu made the comment and what he meant by it.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is indisputable that Chu called coal his worst nightmare. In fact, you can\n <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLr4YbStc0M#t=m28s16\" target=\"_blank\">\n  watch him make the comment\n </a>\n during a videotaped talk on YouTube. (He says \"Coal is my worst nightmare\" at the 28-minute, 16-second mark.) It was part of a long speech he gave on renewable energy, and the video makes it clear he was talking about worldwide coal use.\n</p>\n<p>\n The context was a discussion of global warming, and he was talking about global coal supplies and what it meant for global warming. He was not talking about domestic utilities or energy prices for consumers.\n</p>\n<p>\n &nbsp;At his confirmation hearing, Chu was asked about the \"nightmare\" comment, and he explained it this way:\n</p>\n<p>\n \"I said that in the following context. If the world continues to use coal the way we are using it today, and the world &mdash; I mean in particular not only the United States but China, India and Russia &mdash; then it is a pretty bad dream. That is to say in China, for example, they have not yet begun to even trap the sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides. There's mercury. There's particulate matter, as well as carbon dioxide.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"But I also say many times in my talks that coal is an abundant resource in the world. Two-thirds of the known coal reserves in the world lie in only four countries: the United States, first and foremost, followed by India, China and Russia.  India, China, Russia and the United States, I believe, will not turn their back on coal.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"So it is imperative that we figure out a way to use coal as cleanly as possible. And so for that reason &mdash; and I think &mdash; again, my optimism as scientist &mdash; we will develop those technologies to capture a large fraction of the carbon dioxide that's emitted in coal plants and to safely sequester them. So if confirmed as secretary of energy, I will work very hard to extensively develop these technologies, so that the United States and the rest of the world can use it.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n We watched the video, and this seems like an accurate description of the context of his remarks. So Inhofe's \"nightmare\" comment is literally accurate, but it divorces Chu's words of important context. Still, there are aspects of coal that genuinely disturb Chu.\n</p>\n<p>\n We deduct points for that lack of context and find Inhofe's charge Mostly True.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:27:52.669763", "ruling_date": "2009-01-18T15:37:04", "ruling_headline": "Chu said all the world's coal burned up is \"worst nightmare\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "chu-said-all-worlds-coal-burned-worst-nightmare", "ruling_link_text": "A little context would help", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\n Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Steven Chu biography, accessed Jan. 18, 2009\n</p>\n<p>\n U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, \"\n <a href=\" http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=3cc7a5af-802a-23ad-4cd5-2e661d6f866d \" target=\"_blank\">\n  Inhofe Comments on Obama&rsquo;s Appointments\n </a>\n ,\" Dec. 15, 2008\n <br />\n <br />\n The Wall Street Journal, Environmental Capital Blog, \"\n <a href=\" http://blogs.wsj.com/environmentalcapital/2008/12/11/steven-chu-coal-is-my-worst-nightmare/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Stephen Chu: 'Coal is My Worst Nightmare\n </a>\n ,'\" Dec. 11, 2008, access Jan. 16, 2008\n <br />\n <br />\n Steven Chu, \"\n <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLr4YbStc0M\" target=\"_blank\">\n  The Energy Problem: What the Helios Project can do about it\n </a>\n ,\" speech delivered April 23, 2007, accessed via YouTube Jan. 16, 2009\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "James", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Oklahoma", "id": 114, "last_name": "Inhofe", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "james-inhofe", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-jamesinhofe.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/114/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://inhofe.senate.gov/public/"}, "statement": "<p>Energy nominee Steven Chu has called coal \"his worst nightmare.\"</p>", "statement_context": "in a news release", "statement_date": "2008-12-15", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Secretary of Energy designee", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Steven", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "California", "id": 115, "last_name": "Chu", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "steven-chu", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-stevenchu.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/115/", "total_count": 0, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": null}
