Roosevelt had in mind when he signed it into law in 1935, according to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We adopted the modern Social Security system at a time when the average person died before they were old enough to get Social Security,&quot; he said during a Dec. 2 interview on &quot;The John Fredericks Show,&quot; broadcast in Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We now have some people who are living 50 years on Social Security,&quot; Gingrich said. &quot;Nobody ever tried to design a system like this, and we&rsquo;re going to have to rethink our whole approach.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if Gingrich was right about life expectancy falling short of Social Security age in 1935.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/history/35actinx.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>bill</u></a> signed by Roosevelt offered benefits to retirees when they turned 65.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. life expectancy for a person born in 1935 was just under 62 years, according to <a href=\"http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005148.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>records</u></a> from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On average, girls were expected to live to 64 and boys to 60.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were curious whether the retirement age was set purposely at 65 to deprive most people of receiving Social Security. Did Roosevelt make this calculation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Certainly the Roosevelt administration did not,&quot; said Edward Berkowitz, a professor of public policy at George Washington University and author of several books on Social Security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My understanding, that I received from longtime Social Security actuary Robert Myers, was that the age 65 had no particular significance and was chosen because a choice needed to be made and (it) seemed reasonable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myers, who died in 2010, helped to write the Social Security law and in a 1992 memoir offered a simple explanation for how the Roosevelt administration chose the qualifying age for benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Age 65 was picked because 60 was too young and 70 was too old,&quot; he wrote. &quot;So we split the difference.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berkowitz told us that life expectancy at birth - then and now - &quot;is not a good measure of how many people who are working and paying into Social Security will die before age 65.&quot; That&rsquo;s because the life expectancy average is skewed by infant deaths. After infancy is survived, life expectancy goes up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, we&rsquo;ll give you one final set of numbers. Average U.S. life expectancy from birth in 2015 was <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db267.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>78.8 years</u></a>, according to figures just released by the National Center for Health Statistics.
