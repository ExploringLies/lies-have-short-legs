Ted Strickland has long campaigned on being a champion of education, even going so far as to inject himself into the landmark school funding decision in Ohio back when he was a congressman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo it&rsquo;s no surprise that the Democratic governor is peppering &nbsp;his campaign speeches with references to increasing school funding.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor example, in a July 6, 2010, speech in Columbus, Strickland lamented funding cuts done in several other states before saying &quot;in Ohio, we invested in our children, raising school funding by 5.5 percent in the last budget.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim is such a popular theme with Strickland, we decided to look more closely at his assertion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile it&rsquo;s true that the total pot of money going to funding primary and secondary schools in Ohio will grow by 5.5 percent during the current two-year state budget that ends in July 2011, it&rsquo;s not state aid that is responsible for the hike. State aid to schools will actually be lower by about $32 million--from $6.542 billion in 2009 to $6.510 billion in 2011. On a district-by-district level, that means about 60 percent of the more than 600 school districts in Ohio will get less money for operations in the current two-year budget cycle than they did before.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInstead, it&rsquo;s federal money, including stimulus funding dollars which makes the statewide school funding pie bigger. And a large portion of the federal funding for primary and secondary education must be funneled into very specific programs such as $922 million statewide in combined federal Title I and IDEA funding. Title I money must be spent on things like additional teachers, intervention specialists for low-income students. IDEA funds must be spent on the education of special needs children.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe natural impression left by the governor&rsquo;s words &quot;we invested in our children, increasing school funding&quot; is that Ohio&rsquo;s state government took steps to increase the amount it puts toward education. In fact, it was the federal government that has invested more in Ohio&rsquo;s children. And six out of 10 Ohio schools districts have less money to spend on operations than they did in the previous budget under Strickland.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe find the governor&rsquo;s claim to be False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/07/ted_strickland_claims_ohio_inv.html\">Comment on this item</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-22T18:26:24.969093", "ruling_date": "2010-07-23T11:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ted Strickland claims Ohio invested more in school funding", "ruling_headline_slug": "ted-stricklands-claim-about-increased-school-fundi", "ruling_link_text": "State funding actually is reduced", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tGov.
