So, I support what we have right now.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs that what we have right now?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to Vince Leibowitz, Shami&#39;s campaign director and senior strategist, Shami was &quot;probably talking about&quot; Harris County, &quot;where the clerk&#39;s office was requesting driver&#39;s licenses for people to vote.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome background: Harris County started using a computerized system in 2008 where poll workers swiped driver&#39;s licenses in lieu of checking voter registration cards during the early voting period.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Hector DeLeon, director of communications at the Harris County Clerk&#39;s office, said voters aren&#39;t required to show their licenses, nor does the clerk&#39;s office push one type of document over the other.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe program, designed to expedite the voting process for voters who want to use an ID or license instead of their voter registration card, is &quot;just an option when people show up,&quot; he said. &quot;A good number of people show up with their license.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to state law, voters are not required to show a photo ID during early voting or on election day. If you don&#39;t have your voter card but your registration is still current, you are required to sign an affidavit at the polls and provide one of seven documents &mdash; including a driver&#39;s license, a current utility bill, a bank statement or paycheck &mdash; that shows your name and address.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYou can register to vote if you don&#39;t have a driver&#39;s license or a Social Security number, but you&#39;ll be flagged on the official voter registration list with an &quot;ID&quot; annotation, which cues poll workers to request another form of ID in addition to your voter card.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo state law doesn&#39;t require voters to show a driver&#39;s license, but do poll workers still ask for it?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tApparently, not in Harris County. &quot;When somebody shows up to vote, nobody asks for this first or this second,&quot; DeLeon said. He said the Harris County Clerk&#39;s office trains poll workers in what documents are acceptable.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMaybe somebody should tell the Secretary of State&#39;s election division. When we called that office, a representative told us (incorrectly) that we need a photo ID to vote &mdash; even if we have a voter registration card. She also said a driver&#39;s license is preferred.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShami is correct that poll workers verify that voters are registered &mdash; and voters can use a driver&#39;s license as a substitute for their registration card. But state law doesn&#39;t require poll workers to ask voters for their license, and voters can use other forms of ID to cast their ballots.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Shami&#39;s claim Half True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-02-09T18:36:42.111528", "ruling_date": "2010-02-12T15:15:12", "ruling_headline": "Shami says poll workers request voters' driver's licenses to verify citizenship", "ruling_headline_slug": "shami-says-poll-workers-request-voters-drivers-lic", "ruling_link_text": "No driver's license?
