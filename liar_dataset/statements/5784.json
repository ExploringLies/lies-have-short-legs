The idea is to ensure light media coverage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats and liberal interest groups accused Republican Gov. Scott Walker of an all-time classic dump on Good Friday, when Walker&rsquo;s office announced by news release he had signed four bills they had labeled as part of a &quot;war on women.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s more, they said he concealed the fact they were signed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an April 6, 2012, news <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=266549\">release</a>, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Falk challenged Walker to &quot;explain to the people of Wisconsin why in secret, he allowed legislation that will restrict women&rsquo;s access to health care and equal pay and will end age-appropriate sex education for students to become law.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe added that Walker had &quot;violated the trust of the people.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWait.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCan a bill signing announced by news release really constitute &quot;a secret&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-signs-dozens-of-bills-into-law-gh4t9ll-146443915.html\">four bills</a> at issue <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/sb202\">prevent people</a> subjected to employment discrimination from seeking damages in state court; reverse a 2010 ban on <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/sb237\">abstinence-only sex education </a>courses; create new requirements for getting <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/SB306\">medical advice before abortions</a>; and <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/reg/sen/bill/sb92\">prohibit insurance plans</a> offered in Wisconsin under the federal health care reform law from covering some abortions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDemocrats say they are part of a broader GOP &quot;war on women.&quot; Republicans said the bills protect women and reverses ill-advised legislation passed when Democrats had control.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut what about the signed-in-secret part?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bills, of course, were argued and approved in public. And once signed into law, they ultimately are published. So from that perspective no bill signings are secret.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSometimes, bills are signed in elaborate ceremonies in front of TV cameras that are announced in advance. Most bills, though, are signed quietly by the governor and announced via news release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s look at this case more closely.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker faced a legal deadline, based on when the bills passed, to sign or reject the four bills. That deadline was Thursday, April 5, 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat day, the Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s Capitol bureau reporters -- and other media members -- asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie if the bills had been signed. He declined to directly say.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo back up her statement, Falk&rsquo;s campaign alleged there had been a one-day gap between when Walker signed the bills and his office&rsquo;s April 6, 2012 <a href=\"http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=266554\">announcement</a>, which listed the four among 51 bills that had been signed.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tWe checked <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/journals/senate/20120409\">legislative records</a>, and they listed the bills being signed on Thursday (most of the others were signed on Friday).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition to April 6, 2012 being Good Friday, it was opening day for the Milwaukee Brewers -- a &quot;Friday dump&quot; bonus.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe news release, issued at about 12:30 p.m. -- a couple hours before the first pitch at Miller Park -- offered no comments about any of the bills. It was the first time Democratic lawmakers, who are copied on the releases, were notified they had been signed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Democratic lawmakers -- and the public -- were not notified in a timely fashion about the four bills in question.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s more, the release said Walker &quot;signed bills into law today&quot; (italics ours).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the public notice itself was misleading on when they were signed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Werwie precisely when and where the four bills were signed. He would only say that it was not &quot;the dark of night&quot; as critics alleged, and that Walker didn&rsquo;t sign them in his office because &quot;he didn&rsquo;t have time.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn that same day, Walker signed two job-creation bills at Palermo&rsquo;s Pizza in Milwaukee. This underlines a point about bill signings and announcements: In the same manner politicians call attention to popular measures with public signings (for political advantage), they can downplay controversial ones by skipping one (also seeking political advantage).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the end, it all becomes public. The secretary of state gets the bills within 24 hours of a signing, and publishes them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo find out more, we called the sponsors of the four bills.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey told us there was a private signing ceremony -- on Thursday, April 5, 2012, at the governor&rsquo;s Milwaukee office. The Republican sponsors were invited to attend, according to Sen. Mary Lazich (R-New Berlin) and an aide to Rep. Michelle Litjens (R-Oshkosh) &nbsp;though neither of those officials could make it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome additional information:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe general timing of Walker&rsquo;s move was influenced by the Legislature&rsquo;s actions. The bills in question were not sent to Walker until March 29, 2012. The state constitution gives Walker six working days to sign or veto.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the timing with Easter Week was determined by lawmakers, while the specific day that week was Walker&rsquo;s call.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA big-batch signing itself is not unusual, especially in the rush at the end of a legislative session. Earlier that week, Walker issued a similar news release announcing 36 bill signings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEchoing <a href=\"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/host.madison.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/3e/53e753cc-801e-11e1-8675-0019bb2963f4/4f7f435d0a5a6.pdf.pdf\">others</a>, Falk took Walker to task for signing the four bills &quot;in secret.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFalk&rsquo;s words suggest at the very least a highly unusual effort to conceal an &nbsp;official action. And the record reflects that. It&rsquo;s clear to us that Walker cloaked the signing from reporters, and delayed his announcement to the public and Democratic lawmakers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut although Walker sought to quietly approve these bills -- that&rsquo;s his prerogative. The timing was only partially in his control, and it&rsquo;s not unusual to sign big batches of bills out of direct public view, for practical reasons or political ones.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe think it&rsquo;s a stretch to call it &quot;secret&quot; when the signing will ultimately become public -- and when it was announced in a news release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn short, we think there&rsquo;s an element of truth to Falk&rsquo;s claim but it ignores critical facts that could give a different impression.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s our definition of Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-04-20T17:57:55.029521", "ruling_date": "2012-04-22T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Kathleen Falk says Gov.
