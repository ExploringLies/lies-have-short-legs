But he gives particular focus to the margins in his 2014 re-election victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Feb. 26, 2015, Walker spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference, along with a host of other Republicans who are pondering a presidential run in 2016. The same day, he did an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhqPOBpI0gc\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview</u></a> with Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hannity&#39;s first question went to Walker&rsquo;s electability: &quot;How does a Republican win in Wisconsin because, on a presidential level, they haven&#39;t won since &#39;84?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was the year Ronald Reagan won a second term in a landslide. Since then, the state has gone Democratic seven straight times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You&#39;ve got to go big and you&#39;ve got to go bold,&quot; Walker replied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He continued by describing his 2014 win for a second term,<strong> </strong>over Democrat Mary Burke:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I mean, ironically, I had solid support. In fact, I think more than any Republican governor in the country, I took a higher percentage of the Republican vote this last go-around, and yet I also carried independents by 12 points.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered about the numbers in Walker&rsquo;s claim, one he repeated several days later in an <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday-chris-wallace/2015/03/01/gov-walker-cpac-record-wisconsin-rep-scalise-talks-dhs-funding-fight#p//v/4087171184001\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview</u></a> with Chris Wallace on &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, did Walker win a higher percentage of the Republican vote in 2014 than any other Republican governor?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And did he also win independent voters by a margin of 12 points?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2014 exit polls</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.edisonresearch.com/election-polling/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Edison Research</u></a> does exit polling for five TV networks and the Associated Press.

But he was running for an open seat. And exit polls, like any poll, have a margin of error and the difference between 96 percent and 97 percent are within the margin of error. At the same time, they are the best numbers available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Walker&rsquo;s Republican support was extremely high, but not quite the highest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(On the other side, Walker won only 6 percent of the vote from Democrats. That <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/285037141.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>90-point partisan gap</u></a> -- 96 percent of the GOP vote versus 6 percent of the Democratic vote &ndash; was the biggest of any 2014 candidate for governor in states where exit polls were done, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#39;s Craig Gilbert, who writes The Wisconsin Voter blog.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the second part of Walker&rsquo;s claim, the <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/2014/WI/governor/exitpoll\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Wisconsin exit poll</u></a> found that among voters who identified themselves as independent or something else, Walker outperformed Burke by 54 percent to 43 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a margin of 11 points, one point less than what Walker claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said that more than any Republican governor in the 2014 elections, &quot;I took a higher percentage of the Republican vote&quot; and &quot;yet I also carried independents by 12 points.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exit polls show both parts of the claim are slightly off. Walker&rsquo;s 96 percent support from Republicans was second to Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad&rsquo;s 97 percent. And among independent voters in Wisconsin, Walker led Democratic challenger Mary Burke by 11 points, not 12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, Walker earns a Mostly True. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-scott-walker-on-his-electability-among-republicans-independents-b99455973z1-295026401.html?page=1\">web page</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>------</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>More on Scott Walker</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#39;s Scott Walker page</u></a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-03-04T12:32:47.378790", "ruling_date": "2015-03-04T11:30:54", "ruling_headline": "With 2016 on the horizon, Scott Walker asserts his appeal among Republicans and independents", "ruling_headline_slug": "2016-horizon-scott-walker-asserts-his-appeal-among", "ruling_link_text": "A notch off on both counts", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, Gov.
