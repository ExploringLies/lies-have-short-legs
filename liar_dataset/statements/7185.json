This does not change the ruling.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAdvocates of new taxes for programs know that voters want the money to go to the people the tax is supposed to serve. So, when supporters of a tax levy for children pitched the program in 2002 and in 2008, they made sure to tell voters that administrative costs would be capped at 5 percent of all money received from an increase in property taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means 95 percent of the money goes toward direct services for low-income and at-risk children, or at least, to the programs that serve those children.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPortland City Commissioner Dan Saltzman made the <a href=\"http://www.kgw.com/on-tv/straight-talk/Straight-Talk-City-commissioner-Dan-Saltzman-179044831.html\">same point on KGW&rsquo;s &quot;Straight Talk&quot; </a>recently. (The statement is about 10 minutes into the interview.) The City Council has voted to put the <a href=\"http://www.portlandchildrenslevy.org/\">property tax levy </a>on the May 2013 ballot.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn singing the levy&rsquo;s praises, he said, &quot;And we hold our administrative expenses to less than 5 percent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wanted to know if the figure is accurate, and if so, what that means. We noticed that the campaign pitching a Portland arts tax this fall also stated that administrative costs <a href=\"http://web.multco.us/sites/default/files/elections/documents/26-146_vp_nov_12.pdf\">would be capped at 5 percent, after startup costs</a>. So clearly it&rsquo;s trendy number. (Jessica Jarratt Miller, executive director of the Creative Advocacy Network, said in an email that they borrowed the figure from the Portland Children&rsquo;s Levy.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tW e checked the annual audits of the Portland Children&rsquo;s Levy and confirmed that levy administrators have consistently met the standard of keeping costs at or below 5 percent. For a sense of the dollars, the latest progress <a href=\"http://www.portlandchildrenslevy.org/sites/default/files/CHIF_2011_WEB.pdf\">report shows that in 2010-11</a>, the fund brought in $12.9 million, bringing the total available to $19.1 million. Of that, $560,000 was spent on administration. That&rsquo;s 4.3 percent of $12.9 million. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, we should point out that the administrative cap doesn&rsquo;t work on an annual basis, according to the levy. If fund administrators don&rsquo;t use up the entire 5 percent in one year, they can the following year. Which is why in fiscal year 2011-12, revenue was $10.8 million but administration expenses were $565,000, or 5.2 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLevy administrators look at the cumulative figure: Spokeswoman Mary Gay Broderick reports that from July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2012, total revenue was $95.7 million, with $4.5 million of the money spent on administration. That comes out to 4.7 percent. Grants totaled nearly $90.2 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat is an administrative cost? Broderick explains they include all the costs associated with allocating, negotiating and monitoring grants. This includes salaries and benefits for staff, office lease, outside audit, computer costs, office supplies and general overhead, such as access to payroll and city attorney services. Other groups may define administrative costs differently.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(The groups that receive grant money from the Children&rsquo;s Levy use a different marker and the rates are negotiated separately. Generally, administration costs cannot exceed 15 percent of program expenses.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, is a 5 percent cap a norm? We don&rsquo;t know, and neither does Saltzman. He does not recall how early advocates settled on the figure. &quot;I think the 5 percent came from my belief that we had a pretty high bar to gain public support for investing in kids, and they need to be assured that most of the dollars are going not for our administration but to the programs,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe hunted around for some context. The Portland Development Commission, which is the city&rsquo;s economic development arm, granted $158,000 last year as part of its &quot;Green Features Grant&quot; program. Total staff time to manage the program was $17,000. That&rsquo;s about a 10 percent administrative rate. PDC granted $569,000 through its &quot;Community Livability Grant&quot; program, with $87,000 to administer the program. That&rsquo;s about 13 percent of costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Oregon Department of Justice tracks charities and nonprofits in Oregon. Management expenses and fundraising made up of expenses in 16 percent in 2009 and 13 percent in 2010. So 5 percent spent on issuing and tracking grants sounds reasonable.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPortland&rsquo;s Revenue Director Thomas Lannom said comparing administrative caps may not even be the most accurate way of gauging efficiency. An outfit like the Portland Children&rsquo;s Levy needs little to no resources to collect revenue -- it comes out of property taxes -- while the new arts tax will require bodies to collect what is basically a head tax of $35 per adult worker.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLannom explained that voters authorized his office to spend up to 5 percent of revenue to collect the money. The Regional Arts and Culture Council has a <a href=\"http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=60467&amp;a=424630\">separate 3 percent cap on coordination costs</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Oregon can&rsquo;t judge what is the proper amount for administrative costs, but we can say that Saltzman is accurate when he says the Portland Children&rsquo;s Levy holds its &quot;administrative expenses to less than 5 percent.&quot; The statement is True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-12-18T19:56:49.922322", "ruling_date": "2012-12-19T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Are administrative costs capped at 5 percent for the Portland Children's Levy?", "ruling_headline_slug": "are-administrative-costs-capped-5-percent-portland", "ruling_link_text": "It's written into the measure ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCity of Portland, <a href=\"http://web.multco.us/sites/default/files/elections/documents/26-146_vp_nov_12.pdf\">Ballot Measure 26-146</a>, Multnomah County Voters&rsquo; Pamphlet, November 2012<br />\r\n\tCity of Portland, Ballot Measure 26-94, <a href=\"http://web.multco.us/elections/november-4-2008-general-election\">Multnomah County Voters&rsquo; Pamphlet</a>, November 2008<br />\r\n\tPortland Children&rsquo;s Levy, <a href=\"http://www.portlandchildrenslevy.org/sites/default/files/CHIF_2011_WEB.pdf\">2010-11 Progress Report</a><br />\r\n\tThe Oregonian, Portland&rsquo;s child levy passes, and activists look beyond city,&quot; Nov. 7, 2002<br />\r\n\tEmails from Mary Gay Broderick, spokeswoman Portland Children&rsquo;s Levy, Nov. 13, 15, 19, 2012<br />\r\n\tInterview with and email from John Kelly, fiscal specialist, Portland Children&rsquo;s Levy, Nov. 19, Dec. 18, 2012<br />\r\n\tEmail from Jessica Jarratt Miller, executive director, Creative Advocacy Network, Nov. 13,2012<br />\r\n\tEmails from Cary Clarke, arts and culture policy director, Office of Mayor Sam Adams, Dec. 18, 2012<br />\r\n\tMcDonald Jacobs, <a href=\"http://www.portlandchildrenslevy.org/sites/default/files/2011%20PCL%20Compliance%20audit%20FINAL.pdf\">Portland Children&rsquo;s Levy, Compliance Examination</a>, Dec 1, 2011<br />\r\n\tPortland Children&rsquo;s Levy, <a href=\"http://www.portlandchildrenslevy.org/governance/accountability/audits\">List of audits (website</a>)<br />\r\n\tPortland State University and Nonprofit Association of Oregon, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nonprofitoregon.org/sites/default/files/uploads/file/ONSR_FINAL.pdf\">Oregon Nonprofit Sector Report: The State of the Nonprofit Sector in Oregon 2011</a>&quot;<br />\r\n\tInterview with Carrie Kaufman, Nonprofit Association of Oregon, Dec. 12, 2012<br />\r\n\tEmails from and interview with Thomas Lannom, Portland Revenue Director, Dec. 12-13, 2012<br />\r\n\tInterview with Dan Saltzman, Dec. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\tEmail from Shawn Uhlman, PDC spokesman, Dec. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\tEmail from Jeff Manning, Oregon DOJ spokesman, Dec. 14, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Portland City Commissioner ", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Dan ", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Oregon", "id": 2121, "last_name": "Saltzman", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "dan-saltzman", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Saltzman.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2121/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays the Portland Children&rsquo;s Levy holds its &quot;administrative expenses to less than 5 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a television news interview ", "statement_date": "2012-11-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 127, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/127/", "subject": "Children", "subject_slug": "children", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 203, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/203/", "subject": "City Government", "subject_slug": "city-government", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/2/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
