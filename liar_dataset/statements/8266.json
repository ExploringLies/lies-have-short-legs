Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1309/11/cnr.05.html\">defended him</a> when she spoke with CNN&rsquo;s Wolf Blitzer<strong>, </strong>comparing Obama&rsquo;s international credibility favorably in comparison with that of his predecessor, George W. Bush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You know, President George W. Bush had significantly degraded our international influence around the world,&quot; she said. &quot;We stood alone in the war in Iraq. We were roundly criticized and rightfully so. And today, we have 35 nations that signed the statement in support of the U.S.&#39;s commitment to strike. ... So President Obama&#39;s leadership has rebuilt our credibility around the world with leaders that was decimated in the previous administration.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blitzer pushed back against her argument, noting that the British Parliament, &quot;our closest ally wouldn&#39;t even support potential U.S. military strikes in Syria.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wasserman is right that some countries, such as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/31/world/europe/in-turnaround-its-france-backing-arms-while-britain-sits-on-syria-sidelines.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&amp;ref=iraq\"><u>France</u></a>, have backed a potential strike this time around. But Britain and others are opposed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, we&rsquo;ll focus on fact-checking her statement about Iraq, in which she claimed that the United States didn&rsquo;t have the support of other nations. A reader emailed us, asking if Wasserman Schultz was right.<strong> </strong>Her office did not return requests for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should start by noting that Bush received a lot of criticism for the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 because he didn&rsquo;t have backing from the <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/sep/12/would-us-strike-syria-violate-international-law/\"><u>United Nations</u></a>. But the United States didn&rsquo;t go in alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Bush claimed the support of 35 countries for the action in his March 2003 <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/03/19/sprj.irq.int.bush.transcript/\"><u>address</u></a> to the nation declaring war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;More than 35 countries are giving crucial support, from the use of naval and air bases, to help with intelligence and logistics, to the deployment of combat units. Every nation in this coalition has chosen to bear the duty and share the honor of serving in our common defense,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later that month, the White House released a <a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030327-10.html\"><u>list</u></a> of 49 nations that had &quot;already begun military operations to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, and enforce 17 (United Nations Security Council) resolutions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should also point out that support from British Prime Minister Tony Blair was particularly strong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tell our allies that at the very moment of action, at the very moment when they need our determination that Britain faltered? I will not be party to such a course. This is not the time to falter,&quot; Blair said at the end of a long, passionate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/mar/18/foreignpolicy.iraq1\"><u>speech</u></a> before the House of Commons in favor of invading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Great Britain had troops stationed in Iraq <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8026136.stm\"><u>until 2009</u></a>, while the United States pulled out in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Blitzer asked about Obama&#39;s decision to strike&nbsp;Syria,&nbsp;Wasserman Schultz defended the president and argued that he has support, unlike when the&nbsp;United States &quot;stood alone&quot; against Iraq.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Democrats often criticize Bush for invading Iraq without more global backing, including that of the United Nations, Bush did put together a coalition. Nearly 50 countries, most notably Britain, ultimately supported the invasion, with many sending troops of their own. That&#39;s roughly on par with the support network that Obama has put together for action against Syria, and possibly exceeds it.&nbsp;We rate her claim Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-09-13T13:49:02.842882", "ruling_date": "2013-09-13T14:35:42", "ruling_headline": "Defending Obama on Syria, Wasserman Schultz says Bush invaded Iraq \"alone\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "wasserman-schultz-bush-invaded-iraq-alone-syria", "ruling_link_text": "Did she forget the 'coalition of the willing'?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>BBC, &quot;<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8026136.stm\"><u>UK Combat Operations End in Iraq</u></a>,&quot; April 30, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/03/19/sprj.irq.int.bush.transcript/\"><u>Bush Declares War</u></a>,&quot; March 19, 2003</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1309/11/cnr.05.html\">Senate Vote On Syria Delayed; Debt Ceiling Doomsday In October; Syria Anxiety Surfaces At 911 Service; U.N.
