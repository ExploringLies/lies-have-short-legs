Absolutely not true,&quot; Latvala told the crowd. &quot;One tax increase since I&rsquo;ve been in office. It was a quarter mill tax in the unincorporated area only.&quot;</font></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">Hackworth has criticized Latvala for voting for tax rate increases when he didn&rsquo;t as a city commissioner in Dunedin. The county took advantage of rising property values that already were increasing revenue to Pinellas, he said.</font></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">We wondered: Who is right?</font></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">Latvala referred to a vote for the 2002-03 budget involving the municipal services taxing unit, which is a property tax paid only by residents who live in unincorporated areas of Pinellas. In August 2002, she was part of 6-1 vote to raise the property tax rate, meeting records show. Discussion at the time focused on increasing revenue to pay for recreation and other services.</font></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">Latvala misstated the size of the hike. The rate increased a half-mill, not a quarter-mill, from $1.856 per $1,000 of taxable property value to $2.356.</font></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">At the same meeting in which the County Commission raised the unincorporated property tax rate, it also raised a different tax, a 5.1 percent increase of the telecommunications services tax.</font></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">And a year earlier, meeting records show that Latvala voted with the majority to increase the property tax rate countywide.</font></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">It was a small increase, from $6.75 per $1,000 of property to $6.801, but an increase nonetheless.</font></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">She did vote to raise taxes more than once during her nearly 10 years on the commission.</font></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">&quot;I goofed,&quot; Latvala said, when confronted with the records.</font></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<font size=\"2\">So we rate Latvala&rsquo;s claim as False.</font></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-24T20:01:10.911279", "ruling_date": "2010-09-24T20:03:18", "ruling_headline": "Pinellas County Commissioner Susan Latvala says she only backed one small tax hike  ", "ruling_headline_slug": "pinellas-county-commissioner-susan-latvala-says-sh", "ruling_link_text": "Oh yes, it's all coming back now.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\tPinellas County Tax Collector millage rate records, 2000 to 2009</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\tPinellas County Budget, 2005</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\tPinellas County Budget, 2011</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\tMinutes, County Commission meeting, Aug. 21, 2001</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\tMinutes, County Commission meeting, Aug. 28, 2001</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\tMinutes, County Commission meeting, Aug. 27, 2002</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n</dir>\r\n<p align=\"left\">\r\n\tInterview, Susan Latvala, Sept. 21, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Pinellas County Commissioner", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Susan", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 683, "last_name": "Latvala", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "susan-latvala", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NP_271257_wigi_smith_8.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/683/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p align=\"justify\">\r\n\t&quot;One of the other inaccuracies ...&nbsp;is that we have raised taxes multiple times and run up the budget.
