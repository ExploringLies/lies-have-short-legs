Here we will put a recent Romney claim about Obama&rsquo;s comment to the Truth-O-Meter. To do this, we&rsquo;ll look at the latest Romney <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lifCb7z7x18&amp;feature=player_embedded\">web video</a> in the seemingly endless back and forth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&#39;s how the Romney campaign prefaced the video on its website:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;President Obama recently said: &lsquo;If you&#39;ve got a business, you didn&#39;t build that. Somebody else made that happen.&rsquo;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Clearly, this President doesn&#39;t understand how our economy works.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Mitt Romney understands that we have to celebrate people who start enterprises and employ other people rather than devalue them. Success is not the result of government, it is the result of hard-working people who take risks, create dreams, and build lives for themselves and for their families.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Stand with Mitt today and stand up for Americans who work hard to build their businesses, their homes, their families and their communities.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this item, we&rsquo;ll rate the claim that Obama was saying success &quot;is the result of government,&quot; not &quot;hard-working people,&quot; when he said, &quot;If you&#39;ve got a business, you didn&#39;t build that. Somebody else made that happen.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn case you didn&#39;t catch it the first 5,000 times the snippet ran on cable, yes, those words were uttered by Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut as you can see when you read the full text of his remarks, that quote distorts the meaning of Obama&#39;s claim. (Romney himself has been a victim of this kind of shenanigans, when opponents claimed he said <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/jan/11/context-does-mitt-romney-firing-people/\">he liked firing people</a>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere is the full context, from Obama&#39;s speech in Roanoke, Va.:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me -- because they want to give something back. They know they didn&rsquo;t -- look, if you&rsquo;ve been successful, you didn&rsquo;t get there on your own. You didn&rsquo;t get there on your own. I&rsquo;m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you&rsquo;ve got a business -- you didn&rsquo;t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn&rsquo;t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don&rsquo;t do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this country, you know what, there are some things we do better together. That&rsquo;s how we funded the G.I. Bill. That&rsquo;s how we created the middle class. That&rsquo;s how we built the Golden Gate Bridge or the Hoover Dam. That&rsquo;s how we invented the Internet. That&rsquo;s how we sent a man to the moon. We rise or fall together as one nation and as one people, and that&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;m running for President -- because I still believe in that idea. You&rsquo;re not on your own, we&rsquo;re in this together.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe believe, as do our friends at <a href=\"http://factcheck.org/2012/07/you-didnt-build-that-uncut-and-unedited/\">FactCheck.org</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/an-unoriginal-obama-quote-taken-out-of-context/2012/07/20/gJQAdG7hyW_blog.html?wprss=rss_fact-checker\"><em>Washington Post </em>Fact Checker</a>, that Romney has seriously distorted Obama&rsquo;s comments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney cherry-picked a quote that made it sound like Obama was dismissive of businesses when in fact he was making a point that success comes from the combination of &quot;individual initiative&quot; and the fact that &quot;we do things together.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe biggest problem is that the Romney campaign has left out the lead-up to the statement -- that &quot;if you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese words indicate that Obama was referring to infrastructure and educational opportunities that were paid for by taxpayers through the government -- things that established a necessary foundation for making private businesses successful.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe think his meaning is clear -- that both business people and government play a role in the American enterprise system, not purely one or the other.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn speeches and videos, the Romney campaign has repeatedly distorted Obama&#39;s words. By plucking two sentences out of context, Romney twists the president&#39;s remarks and ignores their real meaning.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe preceding sentences make clear that Obama was talking about the importance of government-prov<wbr>ided infrastructure and education to the success of private businesses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney also conveniently ignores Obama&#39;s clear summary of his message, that &quot;the point is ... that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy leaving out the &quot;individual initiative&quot; reference, Romney and his supporters have misled viewers and given a false impression. For that, we rate the claim False.</wbr></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-26T13:26:16.862277", "ruling_date": "2012-07-26T18:04:46", "ruling_headline": "Putting Mitt Romney's attacks on 'You didn't build that' to the Truth-O-Meter", "ruling_headline_slug": "putting-mitt-romneys-attacks-you-didnt-build-truth", "ruling_link_text": "A gross distortion", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tMitt Romney, <a href=\"http://builtbyus.mittromney.com/\">prefatory material</a> for the web video &quot;Introducing <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/BuiltByUs,\">www.MittRomney.com/BuiltByUs,</a>&quot; July 25, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarack Obama,<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/13/remarks-president-campaign-event-roanoke-virginia\"> remarks at a campaign event in Roanoke, Va</a>., July 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/jul/18/context-obamas-you-didnt-build-comment/\">In context: Obama&#39;s &lsquo;you didn&#39;t build that&#39; comment</a>,&quot; July 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMitt Romney, remarks at a campaign event in Irwin, Pa., July 17, 2012 (accessed via Nexis)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarack Obama, &quot;Tampered&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp8nC9dBhaQ&amp;feature=player_embedded\">web video</a>), July 23, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Washington Post</em> Fact Checker, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/an-unoriginal-obama-quote-taken-out-of-context/2012/07/20/gJQAdG7hyW_blog.html?wprss=rss_fact-checker\">An unoriginal Obama quote, taken out of context</a>,&quot; July 23, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFactCheck.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://factcheck.org/2012/07/you-didnt-build-that-uncut-and-unedited/\">&lsquo;You Didn&rsquo;t Build That,&rsquo; Uncut and Unedited</a>,&quot; July 23, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 34, "current_job": "Former governor", "false_count": 32, "first_name": "Mitt", "half_true_count": 58, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 5, "last_name": "Romney", "mostly_true_count": 33, "name_slug": "mitt-romney", "pants_count": 19, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-mittromney.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/5/", "total_count": 221, "true_count": 30, "website": "http://www.mittromney.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tPresident Obama was saying success &quot;is the result of government,&quot; not &quot;hard-working people,&quot; when he said, &quot;If you&#39;ve got a business, you didn&#39;t build that.
