(They were the third, fourth and fifth presidents.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve only come close one other time, but deaths and resignations interrupted that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull; President Harry Truman </strong>served more than seven years in office, having finished President Franklin D. Roosevelt&rsquo;s fourth term and having been elected on his own once, in 1948 (1945-52).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull; President Dwight Eisenhower </strong>served two full terms (1953-60).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull; President John F. Kennedy </strong>was assassinated during his first term. President Lyndon B. Johnson completed Kennedy&rsquo;s term and was elected to his own four-year term in 1964 (1961-68).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull; President Richard Nixon </strong>was elected president in 1968 and re-elected in 1972 before resigning in 1974 (1969-74).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scarborough said that before &quot;our last three presidents, you have to go back to the 1800s, early 1800s to find three presidents in a row being consecutively re-elected.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s right. The last -- and only -- presidents before Clinton, George W.
