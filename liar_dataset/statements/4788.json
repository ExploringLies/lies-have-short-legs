Rick Perry, who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerry&rsquo;s plan would allow people to opt out of the current tax system and pay a flat 20 percent federal levy on their income.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring a Fox News interview on Oct. 30, the governor did not dispute host Chris Wallace&rsquo;s assertion that the flat tax proposal, by the estimates of Perry&rsquo;s campaign, would reduce federal revenue by $4.7 trillion from 2014 to 2020. &quot;I think Americans are ready for Washington, D.C., to quit spending money,&quot; Perry said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe next day, Kaine&rsquo;s campaign put out a statement saying Allen supports a 17 percent flat tax -- lower than Perry&rsquo;s 20 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That means Allen&rsquo;s plan would actually shrink revenues further than the Perry plan, forcing even harsher cuts to programs that Virginians depend on,&quot; the news release said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered if Kaine was correct in saying Allen backs a flat tax plan that would cut revenues more than Perry&rsquo;s proposal.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnder the Texas governor&rsquo;s plan, flat tax filers would receive a $12,500 exemption for each dependent and would not pay levies on capital gains and social security benefits. Perry&rsquo;s proposal would preserve deductions on mortgage interest and charitable contributions, as well as state and local taxes, but phases them out for people with incomes of more than $500,000. He would also drop the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlat tax supporters say the lower levies would fuel economic expansion; critics say the plans would sap more revenues than can be made up by added growth. An analysis of Perry&rsquo;s plan by economic consultants John Dunham and Associates, done at the behest of the Perry campaign, said it could drain about $5 trillion in federal revenues through 2020.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat, exactly, is Allen proposing? We&rsquo;re not sure, and Allen&rsquo;s campaign isn&rsquo;t providing many clues.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaine, in the news release, based his contention that Allen backs a 17 percent flat tax on a statement Allen made during a June 14, 2011, news conference when he released his economic platform. &nbsp;Allen endorsed the concept of an optional flat tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are a lot of people who would actually like to say, &quot;Alright, here is my income, multiply it by, say, .17, and file it on one page,&rsquo;&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Kaine campaign provided us with transcripts and tapes of two other appearances where Allen used the 17 percent flat tax example. In both cases, Allen used the word &quot;say&quot; before he uttered 17 percent, creating some hedge room.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDan Allen, an Allen policy adviser, said the candidate&rsquo;s wording shows he was throwing out a hypothetical number. A variety of flat tax plans throughout the years have called for flat tax rates of 17 to 25 percent, Dan Allen said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe text of George Allen&rsquo;s economic proposals, titled &quot;The Blueprint for America&rsquo;s Comeback,&quot; calls for a flat-tax alternative but offers no details.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Allen&rsquo;s campaign for specifics -- such as what percentage of income should be subject to a flat tax and what deductions and exemptions should be allowed. But Dan Allen said the Republican has never settled on a single flat tax plan to support.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;To say there&rsquo;s one Allen plan is not accurate,&quot; said Dan Allen, who is not related to George Allen.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe referred us to George Allen&rsquo;s 2010 book, &quot;What Washington can Learn from the World of Sports,&quot; in which the Republican said he&rsquo;s supported a variety of flat tax proposals. One plan lauded in Allen&rsquo;s book would establish an optional flat levy on combined federal payroll and income taxes, set at 25 percent of gross income.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRoberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said he suspects that proposal would drain more revenue than Perry&rsquo;s plan because it affects two levies. Perry&rsquo;s proposal only applies to income tax, not payroll tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWilliams wrote earlier this month that Perry&rsquo;s proposal &quot;would dramatically reduce tax revenues,&quot; by a much as $1 trillion in 2015. But he told us he can&rsquo;t definitively say whether Allen would cut off more government revenue than Perry because he doesn&rsquo;t know the details of what Allen is proposing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur ruling:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaine says Allen&rsquo;s flat tax &quot;plan would actually shrink revenues further&quot; than a flat tax proposal made by Texas Gov. Rick Perry.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaine is correct is in saying Perry endorses a 20 percent flat tax on income, but stretches the truth when he says Allen has made a proposal that would set the rate lower. Allen, while endorsing the concept of an optional flat tax, has offered no plan of his own. The basis of Kaine&rsquo;s charge are Allen&rsquo;s statements that a flat tax rate could be set at &quot;say, 17 percent.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s hardly a plan or an endorsement of a flat tax rate, so there&rsquo;s no substance to compare to Perry&rsquo;s proposal. We don&rsquo;t fault Kaine for demanding specificity from Allen. But Kaine goes too far when he tries to create a plan for Allen based on inconclusive statements.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Kaine&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-14T18:53:39.412829", "ruling_date": "2011-11-14T20:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Tim Kaine says George Allen's flat tax \"plan\" shrinks revenues more than Rick Perry's proposal ", "ruling_headline_slug": "tim-kaine-says-george-allen-flat-tax-plan-shrinks-", "ruling_link_text": "Allen has no flat tax plan", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tKaine for Virginia, &quot;Rick Perry Admits flat tax proposal that he and George Allen support would severely shrink revenues, make deficit problems worse,&quot; October 31, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews with Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, November 4 and November 8, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Dan Allen, advisor to George Allen&rsquo;s campaign, November 7, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorge Allen for U.S. Senate, <a href=\"http://www.georgeallen.com/blueprint-for-americas-comeback/\">&quot;Blueprint for America&rsquo;s Comeback,&quot;</a>June 14, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorge Allen op-ed in The Daily Caller, <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2011/04/18/flat-tax-option-the-freedom-to-choose/\">&quot;Flat tax option: the freedom to choose,&quot;</a>April 18, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorge Allen, &quot;What Washington can learn from the world of sports,&quot; 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Policy Center,<a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/Perry-plan.cfm\">&quot;Governor Rick Perry&rsquo;s tax reform plan,&quot; </a>November 2, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJohn Dunham and Associates <a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/aroy/files/2011/10/Perry-Tax-Proposal-Score.pdf\">report on Rick Perry&rsquo;s flat-tax plan</a>, October 23, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRick Perry for President, <a href=\"http://www.rickperry.org/cut-balance-and-grow-pdf/\">&quot;Cut, Balance and Grow,&quot; </a>accessed November 7, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCato Institute, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=5684\">Freedom to Choose flat tax,&quot;</a>June 9, 1998.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFox News Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/2011/10/30/gov-rick-perry-rebooting-his-presidential-campaign\">&quot;Gov.
