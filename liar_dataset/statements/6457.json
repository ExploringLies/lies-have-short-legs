Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, the Democratic nominee for a Senate seat being vacated later this year by Jeff Bingaman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the ad, titled &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4195iEBZ1E&amp;feature=g-all-u\">Frustrating</a>,&quot; a narrator says, &quot;The past few years have been frustrating and disappointing. Washington says the economy is better, but we sure don&#39;t see it. We&#39;re tightening our belts, but Washington is spending more and delivering less. Martin Heinrich told New Mexico he would fight unemployment, but he spent a trillion of our tax dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas. So thousands of New Mexicans remain jobless, and unemployment got worse. Tell Martin Heinrich to stop the wasteful spending that&#39;s hurting our economy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s correct that Heinrich <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll046.xml\">voted for</a> the stimulus bill known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. But did that bill spend &quot;a trillion of our tax dollars on a stimulus for failed companies here and jobs overseas&quot;? (We tried to reach the American Future Fund but the group did not return our inquiries.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, we should note that while the bill was huge, its pricetag was not as big as the $1 trillion cited in the ad. The measure was passed with an estimated cost of $787 billion, and the Congressional Budget Office later <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/117xx/doc11705/08-18-update.pdf\">revised that upward</a> to $814 billion. Still, generous rounding isn&rsquo;t the biggest problem with the ad&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe most significant problem is that the claim suggests that the stimulus bill spent that much money on &quot;failed companies here and jobs overseas.&quot; Even allowing for some hyperbole, as we do the ad&rsquo;s charge is way off base because it distorts how the stimulus was spent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy our count, the overwhelming majority of the stimulus couldn&#39;t have possibly been spent on &quot;failed companies here and jobs overseas.&quot; Here are just a few of the bigger examples of spending categories in the bill that don&rsquo;t have anything to do with failed companies or jobs overseas. (It comes from a <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/Transparency/fundingoverview/Pages/fundingbreakdown.aspx\">breakdown</a> of stimulus-bill spending by recovery.gov, the federal government&rsquo;s stimulus website, which uses a higher measurement of the bill&rsquo;s cost -- $840 billion.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Individual tax credits for homebuyers, commuting, education and the Earned Income Tax Credit: $135.9 billion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Making Work Pay tax credit for working individuals and families: $104.6 billion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Medicaid and Medicare spending: $92.5 billion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; One-time payments to Social Security recipients: $13.8 billion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Aid for public and Indian housing and homelessness prevention: $13.3 billion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Science, research and development, including National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health: $13.2 billion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what aspects of the bill might conceivably have led to aid for &quot;failed companies&quot; and supported &quot;jobs overseas&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Transportation spending, $35.3 billion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Tax incentives for business, $33.5 billion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Infrastructure spending, $28.6 billion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Energy and environment spending, $26.3 billion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Energy entitlements, $14.2 billion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Energy tax incentives, $10.8 billion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Manufacturing and economic recovery, infrastructure refinancing tax free bonds, $9.2 billion<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you add up all of these categories, the maximum you&rsquo;d get is $158 billion. And that assumes that every penny spent by these portions of the bill -- which collectively account for 19 percent of the bill&rsquo;s total cost -- would have been frittered away on failed companies and overseas jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The stimulus was basically one-third increased spending for existing programs, which could go to failed companies and jobs overseas, one-third for tax provisions that really can&rsquo;t be guided that much and many of which were not going to companies at all, and one-third in payments to the states, which clearly was not going to failed companies here and jobs overseas,&quot; said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublicans are correct that some recipients of stimulus money failed, such as Solyndra, a solar manufacturer that received a <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/15/business/la-fi-solyndra-hearing-20110915\">$535 million federal loan guarantee</a> in 2009 from the stimulus. The company got special attention from the Obama administration, which relished the idea of supporting manufacturing jobs and homegrown green energy. But the company <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_18798313\">collapsed spectacularly</a> less than two years later, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fbi-searches-shuttered-solyndra-offices-plant-in-california/2011/09/08/gIQAu4kRCK_story.html\">followed by an FBI raid</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/items/SolyndraIncpetition.pdf\">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a>. Taxpayers were on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, we&#39;ve found Republicans&#39; claims about Solyndra have often been exaggerated and given them <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/nov/15/americans-prosperity/solyndra-ad-president-barack-obama-taxpayer-money/\">mediocre</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/22/national-republican-congressional-committee/rep-david-cicilline-responsible-federal-loan-guara/\">ratings</a>. And while $500 million is hardly chump change, it&rsquo;s an exaggeration to say that any large percentage of the stimulus was spent on such failures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor instance, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/may/04/line-line-sleight-hand-afp/\">we have noted</a> serious problems with the claim in one ad that &quot;President Obama wasted $34 billion on risky investments.&quot; While the Energy Department has committed $34.7 billion in low-interest loans to nearly 40 green projects, only Solyndra and one other company has filed for bankruptcy. Our friends at <a href=\"http://factcheck.org/2012/05/stimulus-money-for-jobs-overseas/\">FactCheck.org</a> calculated that the government could lose as much as $578 million on those two deals -- less than 2 percent of the total program, which itself is a small part of the stimulus as a whole.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAds that claim the stimulus supported job creation overseas <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/03/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-jobs-finland/\">haven&rsquo;t</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/20/mitt-romney/romney-ad-says-stimulus-money-went-buy-electric-ca/\">fared</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/02/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-solar-company-/\">very</a> <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/03/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-streetlights-c/\">well</a> in our ratings, either.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA charitable interpretation of the ad would be that it was sloppily worded. That may be, but we think a viewer unfamiliar with the stimulus would come away with the idea that $1 trillion in tax dollars were spent on &quot;failed companies&quot; and &quot;jobs overseas.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPeople are free to disagree with the wisdom of passing a stimulus and criticize the way Washington spent the money, but it&rsquo;s flat wrong to suggest that any large percentage of stimulus spending ended up going to failed companies and jobs overseas. About four-fifths of the total spent was allocated to items that literally couldn&rsquo;t go for those purposes. We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-13T17:28:57.459670", "ruling_date": "2012-08-14T17:21:30", "ruling_headline": "Did a New Mexico Rep. spend $1 trillion in tax dollars on a stimulus for \"failed companies here and jobs overseas\"?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-new-mexico-rep-spend-1-trillion-tax-dollars-st", "ruling_link_text": "Much of the stimulus literally couldn't be spent that way", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAmerican Future Fund, &quot;Frustrating&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4195iEBZ1E&amp;feature=g-all-u\">ad</a>), Aug. 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Christian Science Monitor</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Donald-Marron/2010/0825/New-price-tag-for-stimulus-814-billion\">New price tag for stimulus: $814 billion,</a>&quot; Aug. 25, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/117xx/doc11705/08-18-update.pdf\">The Budget and Economic Outlook: An Update</a>,&quot; August 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRecovery.gov, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/Transparency/fundingoverview/Pages/fundingbreakdown.aspx\">Breakdown of Funding</a>,&quot; accessed Aug. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHouse <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll046.xml\">roll call vote</a> on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Jan 28, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/may/04/line-line-sleight-hand-afp/\">Line by line: How an ad uses sleight-of-hand to distort facts on stimulus</a>,&quot; May 4, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, Aug. 10, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 1873, "last_name": "American Future Fund", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "american-future-fund", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/aff.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1873/", "total_count": 5, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://americanfuturefund.com/about-us"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays U.S. Rep.
