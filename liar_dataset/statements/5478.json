Bob McDonnell says the country can&rsquo;t afford another four years of President Barack Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;[The president&rsquo;s] budget would call for about $25 trillion in debt by the end of his term, if he was re-elected,&quot; McDonnell, a Republican, said at Politico&rsquo;s Feb. 24 State Solutions Conference.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe total U.S. debt stands at about $15.5 trillion. About two-thirds of it is owed to investors and the rest is owed to trust funds for government programs such as Social Security and Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcDonnell&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/Events/Politico-Maryland-Virginia-Governors-Talk-About-Jobs/10737428528/\">statement</a> caught our eye. If Obama is re-elected, would his policies really lead to a &nbsp;$9.5 trillion expansion of the national debt by the time the president leaves office in January 2017?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTucker Martin, a spokesman for the governor, stressed to us that McDonnell&rsquo;s statement was made during an hour-long &quot;extemporaneous&quot; exchange over a range of issues. Then he offered a clarification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMartin said in an email that McDonnell had cited a figure on what the debt would be at the end of a 10-year projection contained in the president&rsquo;s budget for the current 2012 fiscal year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMartin pointed to White House <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/pdf/BUDGET-2012-BUD-29.pdf\">summary tables</a> for that budget estimating it would lead to a total national debt of $26.3 trillion in 2021. The tables essentially assume that policies in the budget will be carried out for a decade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Feb. 13, more than a week before McDonnell made his statement, the president introduced his budget for fiscal 2013, which starts Oct. 1. The White House <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/tables.pdf\">projected</a> the plan would lead to gross national debts of $25 trillion in 2021 and $25.9 trillion in 2022.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Under the terms of his introduced budgets, the president, if re-elected, would leave office in January 2017 with the national debt estimated to reach approximately $25 trillion by 2021,&quot; Martin said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that&rsquo;s not what the governor said. McDonnell said the debt would hit the $25 trillion mark by the end of a hypothetical second Obama term in January 2017. There&rsquo;s a considerable difference.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe president&rsquo;s current spending proposal projects the debt will grow to $21.3 trillion by the end of fiscal 2017 -- the last year for which a two-term Obama would submit a budget. That&rsquo;s still a leap from the current debt, but $3.7 trillion below what McDonnell said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo put that number in focus, $3.7 trillion is also the entire amount this year&rsquo;s federal budget. The sum would roughly cover four years of government spending on Social Security or six years of outlays for defense.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJason Peuquet, research director at the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal &nbsp;Budget, said that while 10-year projections are important to budget, they are also extremely volatile. &quot;These things are about 100 percent guaranteed to be not right on the mark,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJosh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition -- an organization that advocates balanced budgets -- does not put much stock in measuring debt by simple dollars. Gordon said it&rsquo;s best to look at it in proportion to the country&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product -- the total goods and services produced -- because that compares the debt to a nation&rsquo;s ability to pay.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. total debt is now about 101 percent of GDP. The White House projects it would peak at 107.8 percent of GDP in 2014 under Obama&rsquo;s budget before dropping to 102.3 percent in 2021.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcDonnell said that if Obama is reelected this year, his budget policies would push total U.S. debt to about $25 trillion by the time the president&rsquo;s second term expired in 2017.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor&rsquo;s spokesman qualified the statement. McDonnell, he said, cited a White House projection of the national debt in 2021 if Obama&rsquo;s policies are continued. Indeed, the administration has estimated a $25 trillion debt that year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in 2017 -- at the end of a second Obama term that McDonnell addressed with dread -- the debt would be $21.3 trillion. That&rsquo;s still a heavy load, but significantly less then the governor claimed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcDonnell&rsquo;s statement is based on the element of truth that the debt will continue to rise under Obama&rsquo;s policies, but greatly exaggerates by how much. We rate his claim Mostly False.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-03T11:57:48.962258", "ruling_date": "2012-03-05T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "McDonnell says Obama, if reelected, would drive debt to $25 trillion in 2017", "ruling_headline_slug": "mcdonnell-says-obama-if-reelected-would-drive-debt", "ruling_link_text": "An exaggerated claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPolitico, <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/Events/Politico-Maryland-Virginia-Governors-Talk-About-Jobs/10737428528/\">&quot;State Solutions Conference,&quot;</a> Feb. 24, 2012.
