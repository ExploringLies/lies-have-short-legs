At about 2 p.m. Feb. 26, 1980, the day of the New Hampshire primary, Reagan met with campaign manager John Sears and two other top staffers in his hotel suite. Reagan and others blamed Sears for losing the Iowa caucuses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReagan handed Sears a news release that announced the campaign&rsquo;s new manager was future Central Intelligence Agency head William Casey. It said Sears had resigned to return to his law practice. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSears got the message and left, as did staffers loyal to him.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrich&rsquo;s memory wasn&rsquo;t perfect. But yes, many of Reagan&rsquo;s top aides left the campaign on the day of his blowout victory in New Hampshire.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStaffers left Gingrich&rsquo;s campaign under very different circumstances.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNews accounts said Gingrich&rsquo;s high command rebelled after disagreements on the direction of the campaign. The Associated Press, which broke the story, described the dissent as a &quot;rebellion.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn-the-record accounts indicate Gingrich did not orchestrate these departures as Reagan did in 1980. Staffers left of their own accord because they disagreed with the direction of the campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe departures started May 31, when Will Rogers, Gingrich&rsquo;s Iowa political director, resigned. Rogers told The Des Moines Register that he thought Gingrich wasn&rsquo;t campaigning or fundraising hard enough. Gingrich&rsquo;s departure for a luxury vacation in the Greek isles was the last straw.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFormer staffers Rick Tyler, Gingrich&rsquo;s longtime spokesman, and the campaign&rsquo;s Iowa director Craig Schoenfield both told The Boston Globe after they left that they and others resigned after a series of meetings involving top-level campaign aides. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSchoenfeld told Politico that staffers couldn&rsquo;t convince Gingrich to run a more labor-intensive campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;To be successful in Iowa you need to be here [and] taking a look at the way the schedule was, he&rsquo;s not scheduled to be here in June at all and he&rsquo;s got very few appearances in July,&quot; Scoenfeld said. &quot;You need to make sure that you give yourself a chance to be successful.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTyler told the National Journal that staffers made up their minds to resign June 9, the day the news broke.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are other glaring differences between the Gingrich and Reagan departures. Reagan switched staff during the primaries, as his campaign gained steam. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrich&rsquo;s staffers left at a low point, after embarrassments on Medicare policy, his vacation to the Greek Isles, and news he held massive credit accounts at the jeweler Tiffany&rsquo;s. The primaries are still eight months away.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReagan lined up replacements before he pushed out his old staffers. Ten days after Gingrich&rsquo;s staff left en masse, The Des Moines Register reported that Gingrich had yet to replace his Iowa staff.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the Atlanta Press club, Gingrich referenced Reagan campaign history to drive home the fairly vanilla point that &quot;campaigns go up and down.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Fox News, his point that he had &quot;exactly the same&quot; problems as Reagan in 1980 is outrageous self-flattery.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReagan was on an upswing when his staffers left. Gingrich&rsquo;s campaign is in a rut.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReagan had replacements ready. Gingrich did not.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReagan pushed out his staffers to run a more competitive campaign. Gingrich&rsquo;s left him because they thought he wouldn&rsquo;t do what it takes to win.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrich started off in Atlanta with a statement about Reagan that was close to the truth, but as he repeated it, he embellished the facts so much that only a kernel of truth remained. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrich might wish he had Reagan&rsquo;s problems. But on this one he deserves a Barely True.</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
