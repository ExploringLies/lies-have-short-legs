But they <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/economicdevelopment/as-drug-deaths-mount-new-law-stalls-tighter-state-regulation/1136045\">were stalled</a> by a new law intended to crack down on expensive state regulations. The law, approved Nov. 16 when the Legislature met in a one-day session to override eight vetoes by Gov. Charlie Crist, requires legislative approval of rules that have a measurable fiscal impact on commerce.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state Department of Health now must determine whether the new rules exceed the threshold and require a legislative sign-off -- if they have a $1 million adverse impact over five years on economic growth, competitiveness, employment, investment, job creation or regulatory costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor now, the upshot is that the rules are stalled. What will happen in the meantime?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What&#39;s going to happen is nothing,&quot; said Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey. &quot;And seven more people will die each and every day until the Legislature ratifies these rules that are being approved by the Board of Medicine and the Department of Health.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFasano was a sponsor of the pain clinic legislation that cracked down on facilities freely dispensing medications&nbsp;being used by drug abusers who were doctor-shopping. Fasano also was critical of the Legislature for passing the new rule-making bill, arguing it needed more study.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor this item, we wanted to examine the scope of the problem. Is Fasano correct that seven people die each day from prescription drug abuse?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFasano was referring to a <a href=\"http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/Content/getdoc/742e2162-c1de-4ecd-bce4-857a32c6f42e/2009-Drug-Report.aspx\">2009 study </a>by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement that tracked which drugs were identified in deceased people. The study shows Fasano is correct: 2,488 people died in Florida with at least one prescription drug listed as the cause of death. That works out to an average of 6.8 people per day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe drug that caused the most deaths (1,185) in 2009 was oxycodone, a strong pain killer. That was followed by benzodiazepines, which are used to treat stress, anxiety and seizures (1,099), methadone (720), alcohol (559), cocaine (529) and morphine (302).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCompared to previous years, prescription drug abuse is significantly higher. In 2005 --<a href=\"http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/Content/getdoc/170b29f2-f109-418f-a65b-40b737681d3f/2005MERDrugReport.aspx\"> the earliest report on the FDLE website </a>-- oxycodone was only responsible for 340 deaths. That&#39;s nearly a 250 percent increase in four years. Benzodiazepines, the drugs used for stress, were listed as the cause of death for 574 people.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne drug that showed a significant drop was cocaine. In 2005, it resulted in 732 deaths, or about 200 more than last year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrescription drug deaths have exploded so much that FDLE did not list them as a separate category in 2005, though past reports noted the steady increase of oxycodone-related deaths.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&#39;s worth noting that the report lists all deaths related to prescription drugs -- not only people who got their drugs from pill mills. &quot;There&#39;s no way of telling if they specifically got their meds from a pain clinic,&quot; said Capt. Robert Alfonso, head of the Pinellas County Sheriff&#39;s narcotics unit. &quot;The only thing we can really quantify is that people are dying from prescription medication.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBesides clinics that freely dispense hundreds of pills each day, Alfonso also listed prescription fraud as a major problem. People who write fake prescriptions for pain pills can entirely bypass a clinic and head straight to pharmacies. &quot;There are just so many different aspects of this that are causing problems,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf course, the rise in prescription-related deaths coincides with an explosion in pain clinics. Take two examples from South Florida. <em>The Palm Beach Post </em><a href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/state/senate-passes-bill-tightening-restrictions-on-pill-mills-627054.html\">reported</a> that 30 new pain clinics opened in Palm Beach County from 2007 to 2009. And in Broward County, clinics swelled from <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/jul/29/dave-aronberg/aronberg-says-broward-pain-clinics-outnumber-mcdon/\">four in 2007 to 115 in 2009</a>. So it&#39;s logical -- but not precise -- to link the soaring number of deaths with the growth of pill mills.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFasano, an advocate for cracking down on unscrupulous pain clinics, underscores his argument for more regulation with an attention-grabbing statistic: an average of seven people die each day from prescription drugs. The numbers from Florida&#39;s top law enforcement agency bear him out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever,&nbsp;not all of the prescription-related deaths originated at pill mills. Experts say that figure is hard to quantify.
