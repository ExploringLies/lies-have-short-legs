In fact, since you are asking more about it, it is a masterful work on the part of President Obama to bring the P-5, Russia, China, into the fold. They have never voted with us at the U.N. on any sanctions on Iran in the past. So from a diplomatic standpoint to get us to this place was masterful.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some readers asked us to check whether Russia and China have never endorsed sanctions against Iran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we initially contacted Pelosi&#39;s office for their evidence, we quickly heard back from her spokesman, Drew Hammill, who said, &quot;The leader misspoke.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia and China often aren&#39;t aligned with the United States&#39; interests, but they have, in fact, joined the United States in&nbsp;endorsing&nbsp;sanctions against Iran at least eight times before the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We <u><a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/sc/meetings/searchvote.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">confirmed eight Security Council resolutions</a>&nbsp;threatening, imposing or continiung sanctions against Iran in which Russia and China approved&nbsp;sanctions.&nbsp;The votes date back to July 2006.
