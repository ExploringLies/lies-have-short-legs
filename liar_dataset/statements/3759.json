But a caller to the show who identified himself as a Democrat complained that the party is influenced too much by labor groups.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot so, Redfern said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Over the course of the last six months, for instance, the Ohio Democratic Party has raised $1.1 million since the November election. A very small percentage of that has come from organized labor.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGiven PolitiFact Ohio&rsquo;s weakness for a political boast, especially one that includes a statistic &ndash; we decided to take a closer look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRedfern&rsquo;s reference to the last six months coincides with the current election cycle, which began when the books closed on fundraising for the Nov. 2, 2010, election.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio asked for an accounting of the $1.1 million and the union contributions because political donations are not reported publicly in real time and parties typically have several accounts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tParty spokesman Seth Bringman said the money was raised this calendar year; that after the November election, fundraising didn&rsquo;t get underway in earnest until after the December holidays.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe party raised $383,191 this year for its federal campaign account, which is used when the party promotes a candidate running for federal office, such as the U.S. Senate, Bringman said. The Federal Elections Commission requires the party to submit monthly reports on contributions to the federal account. PolitiFact checked the party&rsquo;s claims against FEC records and found the figure accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe party raised another $477,901 for its state account, as detailed in its &quot;pre-primary&quot; report filed in April with the Ohio Secretary of State, Bringman said. The report shows the party raised $455,281. The slight difference is a result of refund and other accounting issues required by the state. For the analysis, PolitiFact Ohio is using the figure reported to the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio verified $858,472 through records. Bringman said the remaining money &ndash; about $242,000 --will be detailed in forthcoming reports. We&rsquo;re taking him at his word, since the figure will be easily verifiable once reports are filed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext we looked to see what percentage of the money raised came from labor groups.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBringman provided a list of contributions from labor organizations received this year. The contributions, which include $25,000 from the Ohio Education Association, total $66,645.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat translates to about 6 percent of the total raised this year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio matched these labor donations to the state report. Bringman insisted that the forthcoming reports detailing the remaining $140,000 will not show any additional labor-group money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also evaluated whether the money raised from labor over the last six-month reflects what the Democratic Party typically draws from labor. Is the figure an anomaly that works to Redfern&rsquo;s advantage in responding to the caller?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the radio program, Redfern went on to say that &quot;our support, financially speaking, has been and will always be&quot; from individual donors, many of them who make small donations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat comment drew a rebuke from DeWine, who said the amount of money labor groups contributed to Democrats in 2010 is &quot;staggering.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe GOP chairman produced a spread sheet for us that showed $8.2 million in contributions from labor groups to 2010 Democratic candidates &ndash; including those running for the Ohio General Assembly and statewide offices &mdash; and to state and county Democratic parties. Bringman estimated that together the state party, statewide candidates, General Assembly candidates and county parties raised about $50 million in the 2010. The would mean union donations accounted for about 16 percent.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo where does this leave Redfern&rsquo;s statements on the Truth-o-Meter?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCampaign figures support his claim that that his party has raised $1.1 million since November. Unions contributed a bit under 7 percent of the total, which allows Redfern -- generously speaking -- to claim the it&rsquo;s a &quot;very small percentage&quot; of what it raised so far.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne important caveat: The figures presented by both Democrats and the GOP only take into account money given to the Democratic Party and its candidates. But that doesn&rsquo;t include any money spent directly by labor organizations on behalf of a candidate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a piece of additional information that provides clarification. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Redfern&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-16T19:26:59.944855", "ruling_date": "2011-05-17T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ohio Democratic Party Chair Chris Redfern says donations from labor a small percentage of party's fundraising", "ruling_headline_slug": "ohio-democratic-party-chair-chris-redfern-says-don", "ruling_link_text": "Only 6 percent, but direct campaigning doesn't count", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWCPN&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.ideastream.org/soi/entry/40057\">Sounds of Ideas</a>, May 4, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeth Bringman, spokesman for Ohio Democratic Party, interviews and email, May 10 and May 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFederal Elections Commission, <a href=\"http://images.nictusa.com/pdf/184/11930809184/11930809184.pdf#navpanes=0o\">Ohio Democratic Party federal account information</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOhio Secretary of State, <a href=\"http://www2.sos.state.oh.us/pls/cfonline/f?p=119:44:634660757742882::NO::P44_RP_ID,P44_LISTTYPE:101936317,simple\">Ohio Democratic Party pre-primary report</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChris Maloney, Ohio Republican Party spokesman, interview May 10, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Chairman of the  Ohio Democratic Party", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 1212, "last_name": "Redfern", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "chris-redfern", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/politifact-chris-redfern.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1212/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://ohiodems.org/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;The Ohio Democratic Party has raised $1.1 million since the November election.
