And he's right about federal spending; it rose a cumulative 53 percent between 2000 and 2007. Because taxes and other receipts didn't rise as fast, the debt soared.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the former Arkansas governor overlooks the fact that President Bush asked for most of the changes that drove up spending, most notably the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that were not fullly offset by spending cuts and the 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill, which drove up entitlement costs. There also were national security spending increases after 9/11 and the cost of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n</p>\n<p>\n Republican-controlled Congresses delivered on each of these high-priority items, and Bush signed them into law. So at a minimum, the president and Congress share the blame for the fiscal policies Huckabee cites in the eight-year time frame. For that reason, we rate his statement Half True.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:24.434625", "ruling_date": "2008-01-31T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Congress delivered, but after Bush asked", "ruling_headline_slug": "congress-delivered-but-after-bush-asked", "ruling_link_text": "Congress delivered, but after Bush asked", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Fiscal 2008 federal budget,\n<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/pdf/hist.pdf\">\n Historical tables\n</a>\n<p>\n U.S. Department of Treasury,\n <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">\n  Current U.S. debt to the penny\n </a>\n</p>\n<p>\n CQ  Weekly,  \"Democrats Blame GOP for Debt Limit Hike,\" by David Clarke, Oct. 1, 2007, p. 2858\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 12, "current_job": "author", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Mike", "half_true_count": 9, "home_state": "Arkansas", "id": 16, "last_name": "Huckabee", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "mike-huckabee", "pants_count": 4, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Mike_Huckabee.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/16/", "total_count": 42, "true_count": 8, "website": "http://www.explorehuckabee.com/"}, "statement": "\"Let's not blame President Bush for all of this.
