Chris Christie recently wielded his veto pen to wipe out more than $900 million in spending passed in the state Legislature&rsquo;s budget. A flood of press releases from Democrats condemning the governor&rsquo;s cuts followed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd state Sen. Jim Whelan (D-Atlantic) was among those expressing disapproval.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In our proposal, we would have expanded school aid across the board and finally realized the promise of the 2008 school funding reform act by fully funding all schools &ndash; urban, rural and suburban. Governor Christie slashed school aid in this budget, preferring instead to extend a tax break for millionaires over funding in the classroom,&quot; Whelan said in a July 5 news release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Christie claimed otherwise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This budget is not only constitutionally balanced, but represents my commitment to education,&quot; the governor said in a June 30 news release. &quot;This year&rsquo;s budget managed to increase funding by $850 million and does so in a fiscally prudent budget.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, who&rsquo;s right? They both are.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhelan&#39;s statement was included in a news release about the governor&#39;s line item vetoes of the Democrats&#39; budget proposal and Whelan confirmed to PolitiFact New Jersey that his statement was about the governor&rsquo;s reductions from the Democrats&rsquo; budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn that case, Whelan is correct: the governor did cut state aid for schools from the budget approved by the Legislature. But year over year, Christie increased overall funding for schools.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s break it down.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor always fires the first shot in the state&rsquo;s budget war. In Christie&rsquo;s February proposal, state aid to school districts was increased by about $250 million over last year&rsquo;s budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered another $500 million in state aid go to 31 urban school systems, the so-called Abbott districts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Democrats unveiled their budget for Fiscal Year 2012 late last month, an additional $1.1 billion in state aid for schools had been added over the governor&rsquo;s proposed budget. They also put another $412 million in state aid for non-Abbott districts in a separate bill that would have been enacted only if an income tax rate increase was approved for individuals earning more than $1 million. Christie vetoed both measures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe increases in the Democrats&rsquo; spending plan also did not withstand Christie&rsquo;s veto pen.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor cut nearly $500 million in state education aid from the Legislature&rsquo;s budget. However, he left in more than $446 million in funding that will go to Abbott districts per the court order and another $167 million for other districts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat aid, as well as the $250 million in the governor&rsquo;s original budget proposal that went untouched, equals about $863 million. So, &nbsp;year over year, funding for schools increased.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhelan recognized this when PolitiFact New Jersey spoke with him. &quot;There&rsquo;s more school aid than last year,&quot; he said, but argued that the aid still didn&rsquo;t fully fund all districts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs a spokesman for the Senate Democrats put it: the year over year increase &quot;only tells a partial story, as the only districts being made whole are the Abbotts.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tState Treasury Department spokesman Andrew Pratt said, &quot;Everyone would like to see more aid for schools, however there&rsquo;s a limit to what we can spend.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s briefly touch on the second part of Whelan&rsquo;s statement, which said Christie made the cuts in state aid for schools, &quot;preferring instead to extend a tax break for millionaires over funding in the classroom.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie vetoed a bill that would have raised the income tax on individuals with incomes over $1 million from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent for two years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut is vetoing a tax increase a tax break?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/19/new-jersey-education-association/njea-ad-not-renewing-jerseys-millionaires-tax-give/\">tackled</a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/19/new-jersey-education-association/njea-ad-not-renewing-jerseys-millionaires-tax-give/\"> this issue </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/19/new-jersey-education-association/njea-ad-not-renewing-jerseys-millionaires-tax-give/\">before</a> and rated it half true.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s recap.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhelan said, &quot;Governor Christie slashed school aid in this budget&quot; and Christie did cut funds from the Legislature&#39;s proposal.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd although Christie slashed school aid in his first year as governor, he in fact increased school aid year over year from Fiscal Year 2011 to Fiscal Year 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor these reasons, we rate Whelan&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/07/politifact_new_jersey_did_gov.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-08T16:35:18.294578", "ruling_date": "2011-07-11T05:15:00", "ruling_headline": "State Sen.
