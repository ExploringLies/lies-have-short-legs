A mailer sent by his campaign claims Santarsiero, a Democrat running for a seat in the eighth congressional district, &quot;wrote PA&rsquo;s Gun Safety Law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pennsylvania doesn&rsquo;t have a law named for gun safety. So we decided to look a little deeper into Santarsiero&rsquo;s gun-related claims to see which law his campaign was touting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad goes on to state: &quot;After the shooting at Sandy Hook, Steve said &lsquo;enough is enough&rsquo; and wrote legislation to close the background check loophole on gun sales and introduced a bill to stop those on the federal terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms in Pennsylvania.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s true, but neither of those bills were passed into law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Santarsiero&rsquo;s campaign manager Eric Goldman said the campaign &quot;should have more clearly stated he has been fighting for it to become law,&quot; but added the mailer was not &quot;intentionally misleading.&quot; He said other mailers and television ads on the issue referred to the legislation as a bill or a proposed law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Pennsylvania law currently requires background checks for gun purchases from licensed dealers and for the private sale of handguns, Santarsiero&rsquo;s background check bill would have added a stipulation that private sales of long guns are also subject to a background checks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He first introduced his background checks bill in 2013 and reintroduced it in 2015, but the bill has never been brought to a vote and was last referred to the House Judiciary Committee in October 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, a bill Santarsiero was the prime sponsor of last year would have prohibited the sale of firearms to anyone currently on the federal terrorist watch list, including no-fly lists. That bill was never brought to a vote and was last referred to the House Judiciary Committee in January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to those gun safety-related bills authored by Santarsiero, the state representative implied in his campaign mailer that Pennsylvania has an overarching gun safety law. No such law exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gun safety is regulated by the Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act, the last major version of which was written in 1995. Santarsiero was first elected to the state House in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Santarsiero is running in the April 26 primary to replace Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick, a Republican who isn&rsquo;t seeking re-election. Guns have been at the center of his debates with his primary opponent Shaughnessy Naughton, a magazine publisher. Her campaign manager Erik Polyak called the mailer misleading, saying Santarsiero is &quot;always exaggerating the record.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent television ad released by Santarsiero&rsquo;s campaign doesn&rsquo;t include the claim that he wrote a &quot;gun safety law,&quot; but rather states that he leads in pushing for expanded background checks in Pennsylvania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. that left 20 children and six adults dead, six states have expanded background check regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Santarsiero, a candidate for Congress, claims in a recent campaign mailer that he &quot;wrote PA&rsquo;s Gun Safety Law.&quot; The campaign goes on to reference two bills that were authored by Santarsiero but that never made it out of committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, Pennsylvania doesn&rsquo;t have an overarching law that governs &quot;gun safety&quot; and the law that does govern gun safety wasn&rsquo;t written by Santarsiero. We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-04-20T14:50:41.446588", "ruling_date": "2016-04-21T07:32:35", "ruling_headline": " Claim in Bucks lawmaker\u2019s gun law mailer isn\u2019t exactly what happened", "ruling_headline_slug": "claim-bucks-lawmakers-gun-law-mailer-isnt-exactly-", "ruling_link_text": "He confused a law with a bill", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email, Eric Goldman.
