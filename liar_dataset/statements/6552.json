Lamar Smith said he believes Congress will reach a compromise to extend the so-called &quot;Bush tax cuts&quot; before they expire at the end of this year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were already working on a related fact-check of the San Antonio Republican: In an Aug. 1, 2012, <a href=\"http://lamarsmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=305760\">press release</a>, Smith touted his vote for the extension that day and said, &quot;The top 20 percent of income earners (over $74,000) pay nearly 70 percent of all federal taxes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSmith, whose district takes in part of Travis County, gave similar figures in his Aug. 23, 2012, speech to the Austin-Oak Hill Rotary Club. We&rsquo;ll describe those but stick to checking his earlier 20-percent claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Bush tax cuts are a mix of changes to tax rates, exemptions, deductions and credits enacted in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush and extended in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSmith&rsquo;s press release credits its numbers to a July 22, 2012, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444873204577537250318931044.html\">Wall Street Journal chart</a>, which in turn cites a <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43373\">July 10, 2012, study</a> of 2008-09 data by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The Journal&rsquo;s bar chart shows the top 20 percent of U.S. wage-earners made $74,000 or more and paid nearly 70 percent of federal taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThough there wasn&rsquo;t a precise percentage on the bar chart, there was in the CBO&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2Wzr4_cemD5OTJKbWlpX01SeVU\">report</a> on its study: 67.9 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRoberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told us by email that allowing for rounding, Smith&rsquo;s full statement was correct except for some clarification needed on the $74,000 salary figure (which was also on the Journal&rsquo;s chart).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s how much a single person living alone would have had to earn to rank in the top 20 percent in 2009, Williams said, but the CBO adjusts its figures for household size. &quot;A two-person household had to make $104,700 and a four-person household had to make $148,100 to hit the top quintile,&quot; Williams said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhether to extend the Bush tax cuts for all taxpayers or for everyone except &quot;rich&quot; taxpayers is a major part of the battle in Congress, where Democratic plans have proposed extending the cuts for households with income below a cutoff point (which has ranged from $200,000 for individuals to $1 million). The Republican-majority House approved a plan extending the cuts for all taxpayers in the August vote Smith cited in his press release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring the debate, politicians have made a range of claims about how much of the nation&rsquo;s revenue comes from the wealthiest households. Smith&rsquo;s 20-percent statistic avoids a pitfall PolitiFact has found in some of those statements.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/09/trent-franks/trent-franks-says-top-1-percent-pays-over-half-ent/\">2010</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/18/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-top-1-percent-pay-40-percent/\">2011</a>, Republicans fell foul of the Truth-O-Meter by claiming the top 1 percent of wage earners paid more than 40 percent of &quot;the entire revenue&quot; and &quot;all taxes.&quot; That group paid more than 40 percent of all income taxes, but income taxes are only about half of the total federal revenue pie.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSmith also cites &quot;all federal taxes&quot; -- the whole pie, including payroll, corporate income and excise taxes -- but includes a lot more taxpayers. According to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmWzr4_cemD5dHY3LVlBdHQ1U2tkTW1FMDh5aDJwVGc\">supplemental data</a> for the July CBO report, there were 23.6 million households in the top 20 percent of wage-earners and 1.1 million households in the top 1 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe top 1 percent, the report says, earned $282,900 or more per single-person household and paid 22.3 percent of all federal taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s closer to the stats Smith gave in his Austin speech, which included measures for the top 1 percent but referred only to share of federal income tax revenue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe told us he usually gives rounded versions of the percentages, and produced his reference material -- a chart he keeps in his wallet, based partly on <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/summary-latest-federal-individual-income-tax-data-0\">Oct. 24, 2011, data</a> from the business-backed Tax Foundation -- showing the top 1 percent earned 16.9 percent of 2009 income in the U.S. but paid 36.7 percent of federal income taxes.</p>\r\n<center>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dfYX99ebBs5qKN4p9iMfhC-vm8BrMPAItRGNH9D0-lCZ7NqilxXcZ2zJyRqRDBiauujDHFq08RuOFQjYUf4_QP79AgQdKgkOIW0krcCbyfP8H3rTob4\" style=\"width: 436px; height: 325px;\" /></center>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSmith said the top 20 percent of taxpayers shoulder nearly 70 percent of all federal taxes.
