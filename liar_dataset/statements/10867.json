Scott Walker&rsquo;s proposed 2015-&rsquo;17 budget rankled critics because at one point a nearly <a href=\"http://www.governing.com/news/headlines/mct-scott-walker-tax-cut.html\">$1 billion surplus was projected </a>for the start of that budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker and fellow Republicans returned much of the surplus to taxpayers in 2014, and then slower-than-predicted growth in tax collections further boxed in the GOP entering the new budget cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, while campaigning for president, Walker eagerly touts his budget as fiscally responsible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is even using the &quot;S&quot; word again -- surplus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;At the end of the budget we&#39;re debating right now for our next two years in my state, we will end with a structural surplus of $499 million -- nearly a half-a-billion dollars on the structural side of things,&quot; Walker said in a <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?325754-2/governor-scott-walker-rwi-south-carolina-freedom-summit\">May 9, 2015 speech</a> at the South Carolina Freedom Summit in Greenville.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait, his budget cuts education but it ends up in a surplus?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the claims and counterclaims about deficits and surpluses can get confusing. Let&rsquo;s look more closely at this one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, note the modifier &quot;structural&quot; in front of &quot;surplus.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s important. Walker is talking about a particular measure of a budget&rsquo;s fiscal responsibility, one published regularly by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s usually called the &quot;structural deficit&quot; or &quot;structural surplus,&quot; but even that name is misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The measure is not a prediction of whether the next budget will be in balance. By law it has to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather, it is a tally of the size of the budget challenge lawmakers will face in the following budget (2017-&rsquo;19) based on the spending and taxing decisions they are making in the upcoming one. Think of it as a rough projection of the amount of tax-collection growth the Legislature and governor will need to balance that 2017-&rsquo;19 budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s rough because the Fiscal Bureau doesn&rsquo;t try to guess how much tax collections might rise or fall, or factor in demand for Medicaid health programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it gives lawmakers an idea of how decisions they are making might affect state finances going forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fiscal Bureau examined Walker&rsquo;s 2015-&rsquo;17 budget plan and said it would create a positive balance of $300 million in year one of that 2017-19 budget and another $199 million in year two. This is the report that Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick cited to back up his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That adds up to $499 million, as Walker said. His own budget document published a similar number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Behind the numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the &quot;structural surplus&quot; traces to Walker&rsquo;s proposed cut in aid for local school districts and to timing factors in the way Walker funds school tax credits, said Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You generally run into structural problems when, in the second year of the budget, spending is greater than ongoing revenues,&quot; Knapp said. &quot;That is not the case in the governor&rsquo;s proposal.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another expert agreed with the numbers, but found fault with how Walker phrased the deficit number as a done deal, when it&rsquo;s not through the Legislature yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He assumes that the budget will pass exactly as he proposed it, and we all know that won&rsquo;t happen,&quot; said Jon Peacock, head of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families&rsquo; Wisconsin Budget Project. &quot;Even the governor has been urging changes to the budget.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a fair point; the budget is still in the sausage-making stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peacock raised a larger criticism of using the structural imbalance number as a measure of the state&rsquo;s fiscal condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lawmakers and governors have learned how to game a once-useful tool, he said. For instance, Peacock said, Walker&rsquo;s budget unrealistically assumes a popular form of school aids will disappear in the following two-year budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knapp, too, called the school aid change &quot;a bit of an accounting trick&quot; that seems designed only to inflate the size of the structural surplus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker said a sign of his restoring fiscal responsibility was that &quot;For our next two years in my state, we will end with a structural surplus of $499 million.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reliable, independent source made that estimate, so the figure is solid. Walker, though, makes it sound like a done deal when the budget is still undergoing legislative review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-05-22T11:31:12.669660", "ruling_date": "2015-05-26T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker says $499 million 'structural surplus' is ahead", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-says-499-million-surplus-ahead", "ruling_link_text": "Positive signs but prediction a bit premature", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Emails with Dale Knapp, research director, Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, May 19, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails with Jon Peacock, director, Wisconsin Budget Project, May 20, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails with Laurel Patrick, Gov.
