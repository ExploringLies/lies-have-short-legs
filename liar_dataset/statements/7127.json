Crossroads GPS contributed nearly $6.4 million to the unsuccessful effort to defeat Brown, making it the biggest third-party spender in a race that was one of the nation&#39;s costliest, according to figures gathered by the nonprofit Sunlight Foundation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandel, in an email thanking his supporters, said one of them had pointed out &quot;that our race was the closest U.S. Senate race in Ohio in 36 years -- when Howard Metzenbaum defeated Robert Taft in 1976.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTrue? PolitiFact Ohio couldn&#39;t resist an excuse to dig into history.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe looked first at current unofficial election results from Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. They show Brown defeated Mandel by 278,052 ballots, or 50.35 percent of the vote to Mandel&#39;s 45.06 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen we checked the official record on the secretary&#39;s website. Of the 11 Senate races going back to 1976, none was as close as the Brown-Mandel match. Most were comparatively lopsided, in fact, including Brown&#39;s victory margin of more than 12 percent in 2006.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1976, Metzenbaum defeated Robert Taft Jr., the Republican incumbent, by a margin of 117,339 votes, or 3 percent of the vote. Not only closer than the Brown-Mandel race, it was a reverse rematch of the 1970 election in which Taft reached the Senate, defeating Metzenbaum by a margin of 70,420 votes, or &nbsp;2 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTaft was a congressman, father of the former governor and son of the famed three-term senator who was nicknamed &quot;Mr. Republican.&quot; Before his two tight contests with Metzenbaum, he lost his first bid for the Senate in an even closer race.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1964, the year of Lyndon Johnson&#39;s presidential landslide over Barry Goldwater, Taft lost to incumbent Democrat Stephen Young by just 0.5 percent. It was Ohio&#39;s closest Senate election of the last half century.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio found the history interesting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, Mandel&rsquo;s statement rates True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-11-29T17:11:07.782197", "ruling_date": "2012-11-30T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Josh Mandel says his senate contest with Sherrod Brown the closest in three decades in Ohio", "ruling_headline_slug": "josh-mandel-says-his-senate-contest-sherrod-brown-", "ruling_link_text": "History votes in favor of this claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.5057845616247505\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;\">UPI, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2012/11/08/Republicans-Spending-kept-race-close/UPI-91101352404908/#ixzz2DU8xqNp9\">Republicans: Spending kept race close</a>,&quot; Nov. 8, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Hill, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/266857-schumer-roves-reputation-has-taken-a-major-hit\">Schumer jabs Rove over election record</a>,&quot; Nov. 8, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWall Street Journal MarketWatch, &quot;<a href=\"http://stream.marketwatch.com/story/live-coverage-of-election-day-2012-and-the-battle-between-obama-and-romney/SS-4-15803/SS-4-15806/\">The costliest races in the House and Senate</a>,&quot; Nov. 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/11/08/american-crossroads-defends-campaign-spending-to-donors/\">American Crossroads defends campaign spending to donors</a>,&quot; Nov. 8, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSunlight Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/outside-spending/race_detail/S/OH/00/\">Outside spending by race: Ohio</a>,&quot; Nov. 28, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJosh Mandel, Email to supporters, Nov. 27, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOhio Secretary of State, <a href=\"http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/elections/Research/electResultsMain.aspx\">election results</a>, accessed Nov. 28, 2012</b></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "Ohio treasurer", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Josh", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 612, "last_name": "Mandel", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "josh-mandel", "pants_count": 6, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/ohio-treasurer-josh-mandel_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Ohio", "edition": "Ohio", "edition_slug": "ohio", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 7, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Ohio Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/7/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/612/", "total_count": 31, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://www.tos.ohio.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Our race was the closest U.S. Senate race in Ohio in 36 years -- when Howard Metzenbaum defeated Robert Taft in 1976.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an email to supporters", "statement_date": "2012-11-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
