The one-square mile, densely populated city is filled with old mills and aging triple-deckers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCentral Falls firefighters are among the &quot;hardest working&quot; in the state, Andriole said. &quot;When you look at what they get paid, they are one of the lowest, if not the lowest, paid fire departments in the state and entire region.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered if that was true. So we decided to check it out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, we called Andriole, who faxed us a three-page chart he and the union&rsquo;s business manager use in contract negotiations which shows the annual wages for 33 Rhode Island fire districts whose firefighters have union contracts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe list compares the top &quot;base pay&quot; rate for firefighters. These &quot;Private First-Class&quot; firefighters comprise the bulk of most local forces. (Firefighters with less than a year on the job typically earn less; &nbsp;lieutenants, captains, battalion chiefs and other officers earn more.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Central Falls, the top base pay for those firefighters is $44,892.08 per year. (That&rsquo;s after the state-receiver this month reinstated a 2 percent pay raise that the firefighters had agreed to forgo last January.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBased on the union&rsquo;s list, Central Falls appears to have one of the lowest base pay rates in Rhode Island. (We spot-checked the list for accuracy.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found two fire districts where the base pay was lower than in Central Falls: North Providence ($90 a year less) and the Lime Rock Fire Department in Lincoln ($1,200 a year less).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe firefighters with the highest base pay on Andriole&rsquo;s list are in Warwick, where the top base pay rate as of July was $62,422.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the comparison leaves out other compensation, including one of the biggest pay boosters: overtime.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the fiscal year that ended June 30, Central Falls firefighters received a total of $545,339 in overtime pay -- an average of about $13,300 per firefighter. (The overtime pay in fiscal 2009 and 2010 averaged about $413,000, or roughly $10,000 per firefighter.) Short-staffing tends to drive up overtime pay because of minimum-staffing rules.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCentral Falls isn&rsquo;t unusual in that regard. In North Providence, overtime pay for firefighters during the same period was roughly $21,000, on average, per firefighter -- more than double the average in Central Falls.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Andriole says that overtime shouldn&rsquo;t be factored into the pay comparisons, since it&rsquo;s not guaranteed. He conceded, though, that one could argue that other forms of pay guaranteed under union contracts -- such as longevity, holiday pay -- should be included.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCentral Falls firefighters with five years on the job get longevity pay of $1,500 a year. Those with 20 or more years on the job get $3,000 a year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd then there&rsquo;s holiday pay. Central Falls firefighters currently get an additional 10 paid holidays a year, or roughly $2,100 a year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirefighters also get annual allowances for uniforms and, in some cases, clothing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUntil recently, Central Falls firefighters got a uniform allowance of $975 a year plus a $1,000 a year clothing allowance. (The uniform allowance was recently eliminated under an agreement between the firefighters&rsquo; union and the state-appointed receiver.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo if you add in overtime, holiday pay, longevity pay and clothing allowances, the annual pay for a firefighter in Central Falls with five years on the job climbs to more than $58,000 a year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s significantly more, for example, than firefighters in the Lime Rock Fire Department in neighboring Lincoln.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLime Rock is one of two fire districts in the town with paid firefighters; the others are all volunteer. &nbsp;The department responds to about 600 to 650 fire calls per year -- just under half of the calls the Central Falls department handles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLime Rock&rsquo;s top-paid privates earn $43,680 per year. No overtime. No longevity pay. &nbsp;And their &nbsp;uniform allowance is $700.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs far as how Central Falls firefighters&rsquo; pay stacks up with the rest of the region, that&rsquo;s harder to say.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Nationally, the median annual income for firefighters last year was $45,250 -- $358 more than the Central Falls&rsquo; base pay -- according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy &quot;region,&quot; Andriole explained, he&rsquo;d meant Massachusetts and Connecticut. We found no master lists, but did some spot-checks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe base pay for firefighters in Hartford, Conn., -- a city more than six times the size of Central Falls -- is $45,857. That&rsquo;s $965 a year more than Central Falls firefighters are paid. After five years, Hartford firefighters&rsquo; base pay rises to $68,073 -- $10,000 more than in Central Falls.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe base pay for firefighters in Holyoke, Mass., -- an old mill city similar to Central Falls, -- is $49,011 -- about $4,100 more than in Central Falls.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Holyoke&rsquo;s firefighters earned, on average, less than half of what firefighters in Central Falls earned during each of the last three fiscal years in in overtime pay.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe point is that firefighters can, and often do, earn a lot more than their &quot;base pay.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn short, Andriole was right when he said that Central Falls firefighters&rsquo; pay is among the lowest in the state and region -- but he was talking only about base pay.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe left out some important context - namely, all of the other compensation firefighters receive -- which is why we rate his statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">Mostly True</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
