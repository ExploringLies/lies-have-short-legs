Scott Walker, issued a &quot;recall petitioners&rsquo; rights&quot; memo in late November 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group said you only have to be a qualified voter in Wisconsin; you don&rsquo;t have to have voted here before or even have registered to vote.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMildly surprising to some perhaps, but the next claim really jumped out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.onewisconsinnow.org/\">group wrote</a>: &quot;You can circulate or sign a recall petition even if you have already signed another recall petition (note, however, that only one signature per person will be counted).&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCan you really sign a petition twice?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd will it count for one signature -- or none, or two -- if you pen your name on separate petitions?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s one of many points, from both sides, that has prompted confusion -- and accusations that opponents are misleading folks for their advantage. We already looked at a few process-related questions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s one more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn state statutes, the recall law (<a href=\"http://docs.legis.wi.gov/statutes/statutes/9/10\">Section 9.10</a>) lists eight ways a signature could be nullified. Among them: It&rsquo;s not dated, was too early or late, the signer lives out of state, the address can&rsquo;t be confirmed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere was nothing noted about a case of multiple signatures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut deeper in the statute, we found an answer: &quot;If a challenger can establish that a person signed the recall petition more than once, the 2nd and subsequent signatures may not be counted.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means the first signature is still good, but duplicates can be thrown out, said Reid Magney, spokesman for the Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections the recall process.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat doesn&rsquo;t guarantee they will be. It&rsquo;s up to the incumbent to challenge the validity of signatures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state Accountability Board will review the petitions, but isn&rsquo;t staffed to systematically check for duplicates, Magney said. That puts the onus on the gatherers or Walker&rsquo;s side.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf people do sign more than once, they face no penalties.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There are no legal restrictions,&quot; Magney said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat doesn&#39;t speak to practical concerns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMagney, for instance, noted that people signing more than once could put their own cause in jeopardy because that falsely inflates the true number of signatures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMagney said the Government Accountability Board is not encouraging people to sign multiple times. But he added there is an instance in which they could be justified in doing so.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;People should not sign a petition more than once unless they have some good faith reason to believe that the first petition was somehow fraudulent and believes the circulator doesn&rsquo;t intend to file it,&quot; Magney said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMagney said the agency has tried to make that clear after an anonymous Facebook group (<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Operation-Burn-Notice/127747064001477?sk=wall\">Operation Burn Notice</a>) said it believed &quot;burning recall petitions is fun and games.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne Wisconsin Now&rsquo;s executive director, Scot Ross, cited the same motive for publicizing the fact that signing twice is not illegal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group is <a href=\"http://www.onewisconsinnow.org/blog/2011/11/one-wisconsin-now-establishes-10000-reward-fund-to-combat-recall-petition-attacks.html\">concerned about fraud</a>, especially illegal destruction of recall petitions. Ross said One Wisconsin Now supports but is not directly involved in gathering signatures as the Democratic Party and allied groups <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/walker-recall-effort-to-start-at-midnight-tn31qjo-133810473.html\">push to get 540,208 valid signatures </a>by Jan. 14, 2012, when the 60-day period closes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the right, recall critics including the <a href=\"http://www.wisgop.org/news/potential-petition-fraud-reported-recall-integrity-center\">Republican Party of Wisconsin</a>, and the <a href=\"http://maciverinstitute.com/2011/11/problem-of-duplicate-signatures-looms-over-recall-process/\">MacIver Institute </a>for Public Policy, have raised a different set of concerns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso citing Facebook chatter, they have raised alarms about fraud and double counting, contending that some duplicates will not be weeded out by state officials.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Without a systematic review of signatures, how will we know if the proper process was followed and the threshold for recall was reached legally?&quot; Brett Healy, president of the MacIver Institute, told us. &quot;What is to stop someone from signing a petition three times or 30 times?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMagney said the state agency will look for obvious cases of fraud.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe can&rsquo;t predict whether all multiple signers will be found, but state law makes clear that one -- and only one -- signature is to be counted. And it&rsquo;s perfectly legal to sign more than once.
