At the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion dollars on K-12 education each year,&quot; Trump said on Sept. 8, 2016. &quot;That&rsquo;s an average of about $12,296 dollars for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools. The federal government pays for about 10 percent of the K-12 costs. The other roughly $560 billion dollars spent on K -12 education comes from the states themselves. We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world. And we&rsquo;re doing very poorly in terms of A-list.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in January, Trump made a similar statement about U.S. education spending, saying we were &quot;No. 1 per-pupil by a factor of four.&quot; PolitiFact rated the statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/iowa/statements/2016/feb/09/donald-trump/trump-claim-united-states-spends-most-education/\">Mostly False</a> because it is exaggerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This new claim is a bit more tempered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does the United States spend more per student than other major countries?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The question is, how do you define &lsquo;major?&rsquo;&quot;&nbsp;said Neal McCluskey, director of the libertarian Cato Institute&rsquo;s Center for Educational Freedom. He is a proponent of <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/blog/ending-fed-ed-would-hardly-be-pure-loss\">cutting federal involvement </a>in K-12 education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McCluskey relies on data from the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/\">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,</a> &nbsp;a consortium of 34 member countries that share internationally comparable <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/statistics/\">statistical, economic and social data</a>. Their education statistics from <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cmd.asp\">2012</a> were the most up-to-date available at the time of Trump&rsquo;s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the OECD, Switzerland spends the most per student at $15,500 per student, followed by Norway, and then the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Switzerland ranks <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/09/the-top-10-most-competitive-economies-in-europe/\">first </a>on the Global Competitiveness Index, which ranks economic strength. Norway is a not-too-shabby 11th place. The United States is <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2015-2016/competitiveness-rankings/\">third</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"NCES graph.JPG\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PyW_5aHGBklxQf2KXwN5iEGPc5fGmgIcHfy4Zf25uZoV4h_YvgwjGn-Tn0cu6ozce9LnVkKj-cobMZ8K5ikDswrC40hSlnkRu8EpwToWcwCdZdQmmZTzDUEwXEEB4Auekshl2g7S\" style=\"border:none; height:333px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States&rsquo; per-student expenditure at the elementary/secondary level was <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cmd.asp\">31 percent </a>higher than the OECD&rsquo;s average of $9,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It certainly is the case that we spend more than almost any country except Norway and Switzerland,&quot; McCluskey said. &quot;Very few countries outspend us in terms of absolute numbers. The United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, they all spend less than we do. I suppose you could say they&rsquo;re all major.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s financial figures -- $620 billion on K-12 education nationally, $12,296 per student, on average -- match the totals reported by the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=66\">National Center on Education Statistics.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A conclusion from the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment, a test administered to 15-year-old students in 65 countries, called out the United States for high spending and underperforming. &quot;While the U.S. spends more per student than most countries, this does not translate into better performance,&quot; it read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American students&rsquo; scores on the test were&nbsp;<a href=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/pisa-2012-results-overview%20graph%201_larger.jpg\">mediocre</a>. In math, American 15-year-olds ranked No. 26 out of the 34 participating countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That concurs with Trump&rsquo;s assessment that &quot;we&rsquo;re doing very poorly,&quot; education-wise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For a country that spends as much as we do, you&rsquo;d think we&rsquo;d have better outcomes,&quot; McCluskey said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said that in the United States spends &quot;more per student than almost any other major country in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s assertion that U.S. taxpayers don&rsquo;t get enough bang for their relative buck, when our students&rsquo; test scores are ranked worldwide, checks out. The most recent numbers put the United States at third for government spending on education, behind Switzerland and Norway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Trump&rsquo;s claim True.</p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/93229a59-9bef-456f-937a-ddedc1dfca1e\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/93229a59-9bef-456f-937a-ddedc1dfca1e</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-20T15:58:58.690218", "ruling_date": "2016-09-21T10:18:40", "ruling_headline": "Trump: U.S. spends more than 'almost any other major country' on education", "ruling_headline_slug": "trump-us-spends-more-almost-any-other-major-countr", "ruling_link_text": "The ABCs are $$$", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview, Neal McCluskey, director, Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute, Aug. 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Iowa, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/iowa/statements/2016/feb/09/donald-trump/trump-claim-united-states-spends-most-education/\">Trump is off on claim that the United States spends the most on education</a>,&quot; Feb. 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBSNews.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-education-spending-tops-global-list-study-shows/\">U.S. education spending tops global list, study shows</a>,&quot; Jun. 25, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>World Economic Forum, <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2015-2016/competitiveness-rankings/\">Global Competitiveness Rankings</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Center for Education Statistics, Fast Facts, <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=66\">Expenditures</a>, May 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OECD Publishing, Education at a Glance <a href=\"http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2011_eag-2011-en#.V-FbovkrKUk\">2011</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Atlantic</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/12/american-schools-vs-the-world-expensive-unequal-bad-at-math/281983/\">America&rsquo;s schools vs. the world: Expensive, unequal, bad at math</a>,&quot; Dec. 3, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a rally in Cleveland", "statement_date": "2016-09-08", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 131, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/131/", "subject": "Government Efficiency", "subject_slug": "government-efficiency", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ".@realDonaldTrump's point about U.S. education spending accurate"}
