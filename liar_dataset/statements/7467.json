We&rsquo;re going to give you the skills and the backing and the opportunity to do that, but you&rsquo;ve got to work to make that happen as well. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an unrealistic expectation.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough Walker didn&rsquo;t state it in his speech, he claimed in one of his slides that two-thirds of unemployment insurance recipients in Wisconsin &quot;are not required to search for work due to current work search exemptions.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat seems like a big number. Is he right? Is there more to the story?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Unemployment picture</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEmployment has been a contentious issue since Walker took office in January 2011. As our <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/\">Walk-O-Meter</a> shows, the governor is far off the pace for meeting his signature <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/promises/walk-o-meter/promise/526/create-250000-new-jobs/\">campaign promise</a> of creating 250,000 private-sector jobs during his four-year term. At the same time, he emphasizes that the state&#39;s unemployment rate has been lower than the <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000\">national rate</a> and has <a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/newsreleases/2012/unemployment/120119_december_state.pdf\">generally declined</a> during his tenure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn January 2013, Walker proposed tightening the standards for receiving jobless benefits, a move that would have to be approved by the Legislature.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWisconsinites seeking unemployment benefits must <a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/uiben/handbook/english/contentspart3.htm\">file a claim</a> each week they are out of work. Depending on what their previous wages were, their unemployment <a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/uiben/computing_benefit_entitlement.htm#wbr\">benefits</a> are between $54 and $363 per week.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen filing the weekly claims, the recipients are asked a number of questions, including:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Were you able to work full-time and available for full-time work?</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tand</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Did you contact at least two employers during the week to try to find work?</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRecipients could <a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/uiben/handbook/english/contentspart4.htm\">lose their benefits</a> if they don&rsquo;t <a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/dwd/forms/ui/ucb_12_e.htm\">contact </a>at least two employers &quot;who hire people with your skills or might have other work you can do.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, <a href=\"http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/dwd/127/02\">state regulations</a> waive the work search requirement under a number of circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/uiben/handbook/english/contentspart4.htm\">According</a> to Walker&rsquo;s Department of Workforce Development:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;You may be told that you do not have to look for work if you are definitely returning to full-time work for a recent employer or if you are a member (in good standing) of a trade union that operates a hiring hall or referral system and has signed an agreement with the department. In some cases, you will not have to look for work if you are working part-time.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Walker&rsquo;s evidence</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJohn Dipko, a spokesman for the Department of Workforce Development, told us that Walker&rsquo;s claim is based on calculations by the department.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe department estimated that <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Distribution+Jan+2013+%282%291.xls\">60,167</a> people filed an initial claim for unemployment benefits in January 2013 and were paid benefits. In other words, they were filing for the first time since becoming unemployed; that&rsquo;s when the determination is made on whether they must look for work.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwo-thirds of those people -- 40,119 -- were not required to look for work, the department determined.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe asked for figures covering a longer period of time and were given <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/CY12.pdf\">statistics</a> indicating that in 2012, an even larger proportion of unemployment compensation recipients -- 68 percent -- were not required to work.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe ran the numbers by <a href=\"http://www.nelp.org/site/about_us/policy_co_director2\">Maurice Emsellem</a>, policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project, which <a href=\"http://www.nelp.org/index.php/content/content_about_us/background/\">says</a> it promotes &quot;help unemployed workers regain their economic footing through improved benefits and services.&quot; He didn&rsquo;t quarrel with the accuracy of the claim that two-thirds of the recipients don&rsquo;t have to look for work.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut Emsellem said it would be counterproductive, both for employers and employees, to require laid-off employees to look for new jobs if they are likely to soon return to their old job, or similar work. Those people are not likely to find better jobs -- or temporary ones -- simply by making &quot;cold calls&quot; to other employers, he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGetting back to the most recent figures that Walker relied on, for January 2013, here&rsquo;s a breakdown from the Department of Workforce Development of the 40,119 people who filed new claims for unemployment insurance who were not required to look for work:</p>\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\" style=\"width:624px;\">\r\n\t<colgroup>\r\n\t\t<col />\r\n\t\t<col />\r\n\t</colgroup>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tLaid off, expected to return to job within 12 weeks</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\t29,636</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tNow working part-time for same employer</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\t5,940</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tLaid off, but routinely obtains work through union hiring hall</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\t3,837</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tEnrolled in job training program</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\t442</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tExpected to start job with new employer within four weeks</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\t258</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tOther</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\t6</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\tTotal</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t\t40,119</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">\r\n\tSo, it&rsquo;s not as though the people exempted from work search are being allowed to idly collect handouts.
