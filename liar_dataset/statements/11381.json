Following the assassination attempt, Kelly and Giffords created Americans for Responsible Solutions, a super PAC that supports gun control. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One thing is really clear. We sell 40 percent of our guns without a background check,&quot; Kelly said during CNN&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/10/04/sotu-tapper-mark-kelly-full-interview.cnn\">State of the Union</a></em> on Oct. 4. &quot;That means felons, people who are dangerously mentally ill have easy access to guns.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 40 percent figure was often invoked by gun control <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2013/01/16/president-obama-introduces-plan-reduce-gun-violence#transcript\">advocates</a> <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?310444-1/vice-president-biden-remarks-us-conference-mayors\">who</a> wanted stricter background check laws after the Newtown, Conn., elementary school mass shooting. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/apr/28/tim-kaine/kaine-says-40-percent-guns-sales-estimated-escape-/\">We</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/the-stale-claim-that-40-percent-of-gun-sales-lack-background-checks/2013/01/20/e42ec050-629a-11e2-b05a-605528f6b712_blog.html\">other</a> <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2013/03/guns-acquired-without-background-checks/\">fact-checkers</a> have pointed out that it&rsquo;s based on outdated research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to know if there had been any updates that would give this statistic more weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 21-year-old statistic, recently reproduced in an unpublished survey, is still the best figure available, experts told us, thanks to a two-decade ban on federal funding of gun violence research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Virtually all iterations of the 40 percent claim can be traced to a <a href=\"http://tulprpc.org/attachments/File/Natl_Justice-guns_in_America.pdf\">1994 survey</a> by Duke University&rsquo;s Philip Cook and the University of Chicago&rsquo;s Jens Ludwig. Kelly&rsquo;s source is a <a href=\"http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/vprp/CBC%20White%20Paper%20Final%20Report%20022013.pdf\">2013 white paper</a> that cites Cook and Ludwig&rsquo;s survey as <em>its</em> source, according to a spokesperson for Americans for Responsible Solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey was based on a small sample (251 people) and counted background checks on firearm purchases before the 1996 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which required federal background checks on firearm purchases, was enacted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/apr/28/tim-kaine/kaine-says-40-percent-guns-sales-estimated-escape-/\">debate</a> among researchers on whether the 40 percent figure still holds true today, and Cook and Ludwig have both <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/30/kirsten-gillibrand/gillibrand-says-40-percent-guns-sold-today-escape-/\">said</a> that no one knows the current percentage of guns sold without a background check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Robert Spitzer, a SUNY Cortland political science professor and author of <em>The Politics of Gun Control</em>, noted that the background check statistic is &quot;notoriously slippery,&quot; because gun sales that don&rsquo;t go through a federally licensed seller are, as you would expect, not subject to formal record keeping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;How would a researcher identify a sufficiently large and representative sample of non-background check gun purchases/exchanges, given the absence of a paper trail?&quot; Spitzer said. &quot;My general sense is that 40 percent might be on the high side but is certainly possible.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s the best estimate we have, said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, adding,&nbsp;&quot;There&#39;s no good reason to believe that the number has changed substantially &mdash; though we can&#39;t know for sure.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ludwig told PolitiFact&nbsp;that he can see why people use the 1994 survey as the benchmark, &quot;even though everyone recognizes the estimate is now old.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why is the most recent statistic on gun purchases without background checks about two decades old? There&rsquo;s very little funding for research on gun violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Problems with methodology also play a role, but the 1996 appropriations bill, experts said, is mainly to blame for the lack of research dollars. Strong-armed by the powerful gun lobby, Congress wrote in a provision that effectively banned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from researching the roots of gun violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/house-bill/3610/text\">the bill reads.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It basically was a shot across the bow by Congress on the part of the NRA,&quot; Mark Rosenberg, former director of the CDC&rsquo;s National Center for Injury Control and Prevention, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2015/01/14/why-the-cdc-still-isnt-researching-gun-violence-despite-the-ban-being-lifted-two-years-ago/\">told the <em>Washington Post</em></a>. &quot;All federally funded research was shut down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result of the attack on CDC funding, all government funding for the issue was stifled, agreed David Hemenway, director of Harvard University&rsquo;s Injury Control Research Center. Private foundations, too, were wary of putting dollars toward&nbsp;a controversial and politically divisive topic, he said. (There are fewer than five foundations providing the funding today, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/12/gun_violence_research_nra_and_congress_blocked_gun_control_studies_at_cdc.html\">said </a>Garen Wintemute, director of UC Davis&rsquo; Violence Prevention Research Program, to Slate.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a few years ago, it looked like things were about to change for gun violence research. In the wake of the Newtown shooting in 2012, President Barack Obama issued a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/16/presidential-memorandum-engaging-public-health-research-causes-and-preve\">proclamation</a> directing the CDC and other federal agencies to look into the causes of gun violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In spite of the presidential pressure, the 20-year moratorium on gun violence research wasn&rsquo;t really lifted, and researchers haven&rsquo;t exactly heeded Obama&rsquo;s call. Six days after the Charleston, S.C., church shooting on June 17, 2015, House Republicans <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/12/gun_violence_research_nra_and_congress_blocked_gun_control_studies_at_cdc.html\">blocked</a> an <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/gop-gun-violence-cdc-study-charleston-south-carolina-119384\">amendment</a> that would have funded CDC gun violence research in the next fiscal year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/114th-congress/house-report/195/1\">appropriations bill</a> &quot;continues the general provision to prevent any funds provided from being spent on gun research.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advocates of the funding ban <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2013/02/12/why-the-centers-for-disease-control-should-not-receive-gun-research-funding/\">say</a> the research is inherently biased to support stricter gun control and is irrelevant to the mission of the CDC. In the words of outgoing House Speaker John Boehner, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9X948LOPXA\">a gun is not a disease</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hemenway has managed to get around the lack of federal and private funding for&nbsp;gun research with a recent project&nbsp;financed by the&nbsp;Fund for a Safer Future, a program&nbsp;aimed at reducing gun violence. He told PolitiFact that&nbsp;the Harvard Injury Control Research Center conducted a 2015 national survey with a sample size over 3,000 that confirmed the 40 percent of sales without a background check figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this study has not been published, and we could not read it for ourselves, so we cannot factor it into this fact-check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelly said, &quot;We sell 40 percent of our guns without a background check.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The figure he&rsquo;s citing comes from a 21-year-old survey with a small sample size before a key gun law took effect. Even its authors say they&rsquo;re not sure if it holds true today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, there are few credible alternative statistics because of a two-decade dearth of gun violence research funding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-04T11:11:14.328515", "ruling_date": "2015-10-04T18:36:20", "ruling_headline": "Out-of-date gun background check statistic gets new life after Oregon shooting", "ruling_headline_slug": "out-date-gun-background-check-statistic-gets-new-l", "ruling_link_text": "Still a question without an answer", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with Mark Prentice, spokesperson for Americans for Responsible Solutions, Oct. 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Philip Cook, &nbsp;professor of public policy at Duke University, Oct. 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jens Ludwig, professor of public policy at the University of Chicago, Oct. 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, Oct. 4, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Garen Wintemute, director of UC Davis&rsquo;
