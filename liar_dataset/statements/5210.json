What sort of examination of the California start-up company&rsquo;s finances did the government do before taking such a big risk?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to a news release we received the other day, the National Republican Congressional Committee has found a scapegoat for the debacle: U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Once the poster child for David Cicilline&#39;s stimulus boondoggle, the bankrupt Solyndra company is now a symbol of how his failed scheme wasted taxpayer money on political payback and failing companies instead of creating the jobs promised,&quot; the Jan. 13 release said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe NRCC sent out the release in response to a Washington Times report that senior Solyndra executives were set to receive bonuses despite the company&rsquo;s troubles.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s outrageous enough that David Cicilline supported a $1-trillion failed stimulus package, but it&rsquo;s even more outrageous that hundreds of millions were spent to fund a failing company like Solyndra,&quot; NRCC communications director Paul Lindsay went on to say in the release. &quot;Not only is Cicilline responsible for this irresponsible investment, but he&rsquo;ll also have to explain to his Rhode Island constituents why Solyndra&rsquo;s senior employees are receiving bonuses at the expense of hard-working American taxpayers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve heard a lot of allegations in connection to Solyndra&rsquo;s problems, but never one laying the blame at Cicilline&rsquo;s doorstep. This puzzled us because Cicilline took office in 2011, well after the federal stimulus package that financed Solyndra&rsquo;s loan guarantee was passed and well after the decision was made to award Solyndra the loan guarantee. How could he be responsible?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked the NRCC&rsquo;s website and saw that the same <a href=\"http://nrcc.org/default.asp?id=274&amp;newsid=3409\">news release</a> had been sent out to 49 other Congressional districts, but each time, the name of the Democrat in office was inserted where Cicilline&rsquo;s name was. (The Democrats included Rep. Bill Keating, of Massachusetts, who also took office in 2011).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe then called the organization seeking an explanation of how Cicilline made it on the list. (Curiously, Rep. James R. Langevin, Rhode Island&rsquo;s other congressman who is also a Democrat, wasn&rsquo;it on the list even though he was in office at the time the stimulus bill was passed and voted for it.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn NRCC spokesman said the release was accurate because Cicilline voiced support for the stimulus package when he was campaigning for Congress.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I think the important thing to note is we didn&rsquo;t say Cicilline voted for the stimulus,&quot; Nat Sillin said. &quot;We say he supported it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s true that Cicilline did back the stimulus package. When he was mayor of Providence, he was quoted numerous times saying that the bill would create sorely needed jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd although it&rsquo;s technically true that the release didn&rsquo;t say that Cicilline voted for the stimulus, it did say that he&rsquo;s responsible. That didn&rsquo;t add up to us. Let&rsquo;s run through some dates to make it clear why:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFeb. 13, 2009: Congress passes the <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/About/Pages/The_Act.aspx\">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</a>. Under the $787-billion stimulus package, Solyndra received its loan guarantee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMarch 20, 2009: Solyndra receives conditional approval for the loan guarantee, according to a <a href=\"http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/Solar%20Background%20Document%201.pdf\">timeline</a> from the Department of Energ,.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSept. 3, 2009: The Department of Energy makes the final decision to approve the loan guarantee for Solyndra.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNov. 2, 2010: Cicilline <a href=\"http://www.ri.gov/election/results/2010/general_election/\">elected</a> to Congress.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJan. 5, 2011: Cicilline takes office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe full name of the legislation under which the stimulus package was approved gives this one away -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCicilline took office in January 2011, a full 23 months <em>after </em>passage of the bill enacting the loan guarantee program that benefited Solyndra.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe National Republican Congressional Committee has every right to call the stimulus a &quot;boondoggle.&quot; And it&rsquo;s fair to say that Cicilline supported the stimulus before taking office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Lindsay said that Cicilline is &quot;responsible for this irresponsible investment.&quot; No, he&rsquo;s not.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;d say that Lindsay and the National Republican Congressional Committee simply used overheated rhetoric, but that&rsquo;s an understatement. Their claim is so wildly inaccurate that we give it a Pants on Fire.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em> (Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
