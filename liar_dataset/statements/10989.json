To Coulter, that makes Republicans who support the movement nonsensical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Coulter, however, spouted her own bit of nonsense in trying to defend her position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the Fox Business show <em>Kennedy </em>June 23, Coulter was asked about the ongoing flag debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Where are you from?&quot; host Kennedy (the former MTV veejay) asked Coulter. Coulter said she&rsquo;s from Connecticut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Do you have a geographic ... Do you have a horse in this race either way? Do you consider yourself a Northerner?&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Oh, you mean the Southern thing?&quot; Coulter responded. &quot;Well, I&#39;m a student of American history ... I&rsquo;d really like to like Nikki Haley, since she is a Republican. On the other hand, she is an immigrant and does not understand America&#39;s history.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Coulter got one part of Haley&rsquo;s background right. Yep, she&rsquo;s a Republican.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But she&rsquo;s not an immigrant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She was born in South Carolina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Born in Bamberg, the daughter of Indian immigrants, Gov. Haley&rsquo;s first job was keeping the books for her family&rsquo;s clothing store -- at the age of 13,&quot; reads the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.governor.sc.gov/About/Pages/GovernorBio.aspx\" style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px;\">website</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;South Carolina&nbsp;office of the governor.&nbsp;Bamberg, S.C., is a small city with a population of less than 4,000 people. You may not have heard of it. But it is definitely in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/us/politics/14haley.html\">described</a> Haley&rsquo;s time growing up in Bamberg in a 2010 profile and her life as the American-born child of an Indian Sikh family. When Haley was about 5, she was disqualified from the Little Miss Bamberg pageant along with her sister because &quot;the judges of the contest, one that crowned one black queen and one white queen, were &hellip; flummoxed&quot; by the sisters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;(People in my hometown) didn&rsquo;t know much about the Indian culture, and we didn&rsquo;t know much about how to teach it to them,&quot; Haley, who was&nbsp;Nimrata Randhawa,&nbsp;said during an <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/865354/governor-nikki-haley-new-horizons/\" style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">interview</a> with <em style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Vogue</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Haley went on to receive an accounting degree from Clemson University, and then returned to Bamberg to work in her family&rsquo;s store again. With her help, the store turned &quot;into a multimillion-dollar business.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Then, in 2003, a speech by Hillary Clinton inspired Haley to run for state Legislature. &quot;She said there will be all of these reasons that people tell you you can&rsquo;t do it. She said that there&rsquo;s only one reason for you to do it, and it&rsquo;s because you know it&rsquo;s the right thing. I walked out of there thinking, I&rsquo;ve got to do this,&quot; Haley said to <em>Vogue</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The next year, Haley was elected to represent Lexington County in South Carolina&rsquo;s House of Representatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On Jan. 12, 2011, Haley was sworn in as <a href=\"http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/current-governors/col2-content/main-content-list/nikki-r-haley.html\">governor</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She visited India as part of a trade mission in 2014. Prior to that, Haley said the last time she visited the country <a href=\"http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20141107/PC05/141109495\">was when she was two years old</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">PunditFact reached out to the publisher of Coulter&rsquo;s latest book <em>Adios, America</em> but did not hear back. Coulter, for the record, describes herself as being of Scottish descent and traces part of her family&#39;s roots to &quot;<a href=\"http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2009-04-22.html\">Puritan nonconformists who came to America in 1633</a>.&quot; She seemed to defend her remarks in a post of Twitter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img height=\"426px;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/aLtOxvovWLfM3ieTyUX3tP4DcDQ2bWmXsOK61afxyU79BvUJ-_5pYMGtLIYq6uZWfhBGezoaGH7ZPYHGE0f2M41roZSDzJ-TZbT9G8zefNmLjn9PTGgz2YbQ6qpBrD4SmLiLCTo\" style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" width=\"598px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coulter said Haley is an immigrant and went on to suggest&nbsp;that Haley doesn&#39;t understand American history because she is less-American than others (namely, Coulter).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haley&nbsp;was born in South Carolina, and is no more an immigrant than Coulter, who describes herself of <a href=\"http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2008-01-09.html\">Scottish descent</a>.
