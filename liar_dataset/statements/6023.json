While debating the legislative repeal of a broader election law, House Bill 194, they argued that &nbsp;the prohibition should be reversed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe last three days of early voting &quot;happen to be the most populated days of voting that we have in early voting,&quot; said Rep. Ron Gerberry, a Youngstown-area Democrat, at an April 17 news conference.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGerberry was one of three Democrats at the event to explain their views on the legislative repeal of HB 194 and the importance of allowing in-person early voting the three days before the election.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUltimately, majority Republicans passed legislation to repeal HB 194 without reversing the restriction on in-person early voting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe at PolitiFact Ohio were curious about Gerberry&rsquo;s claim because it could shed light on whether the new rule will affect voter turnout this fall.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we contacted Gerberry, he referred us to Rep. Kathleen Clyde, a Democrat from Kent and a former election official, who stood alongside Gerberry and Rep. Vernon Sykes, an Akron Democrat, at the April news conference.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClyde turned over her research that examined early voting statistics from Cuyahoga, Franklin and Hamilton counties, the state&rsquo;s three largest. The research focused on the final days of in-person early voting before the 2008 presidential election.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe reached out to the elections boards in each of the three counties to confirm Clyde&rsquo;s figures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn all three counties, the number of voters who cast absentee ballots at election offices increased as the election neared. However, fewer voters voted the final three days &ndash; Saturday, Sunday and Monday &ndash; compared to the three preceding weekdays.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe fact more people voted early on Wednesday through Friday would suggest Gerberry&rsquo;s statement is incorrect. But Clyde&rsquo;s research also factors in how many hours the three elections boards were open for business.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen time was factored in &ndash; early voting operations were open for fewer hours on the weekend &ndash; there were more voters per hour during the final three days compared to the three preceding weekdays.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Cuyahoga County, 10,938 absentee ballots were cast at the board&rsquo;s offices on the Saturday, Sunday and Monday before the 2008 election. In those three days, the board was open for 18.5 hours for a ratio of about 591 voters per hour. Over the three preceding days &ndash; Wednesday, Thursday and Friday &ndash; 12,552 such ballots were cast and the board was open for 31.5 hours, resulting in a ratio of about 398 voters per hour.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe same situation &ndash; fewer voters over the weekend but fewer hours of operation, resulting in more voters per hour over the final three days before the election &ndash; was also seen in Franklin and Hamilton counties.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClyde said it&rsquo;s important to factor in the time crunch, adding that, as a director of Franklin County&rsquo;s early vote center in 2008, she would know.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I ran it for 35 days straight,&quot; she said. &quot;We were slammed those three days. Analyzing by the hour is the only way it makes sense.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile the stats show the final three days were the busiest in Ohio&rsquo;s three largest counties, Gerberry used the word &quot;populated&quot; when characterizing the situation, which suggests more voters on those days. The data shows more ballots were cast the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday before Election Day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDespite that discrepancy, Clyde&rsquo;s underlying point was correct: the final days were busier. And it is reasonable to assume more people would have cast in-person absentee ballots the weekend before the election if the boards had stayed open longer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-01T17:22:48.132220", "ruling_date": "2012-06-04T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "State Rep.
