So, to evaluate Clarke&rsquo;s claim, we are looking at what happened specifically within the Office of the Sheriff&#39;s budget. And we&rsquo;re looking at the final numbers for the year, which reflect actual spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to County Comptroller Scott Manske, it is expected that each department lives within the amount it is allocated. Most of the money comes from the property tax levy, though there are other sources of revenue, such as fees and grants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clarke did not respond to our request for backup, so we turned to County Auditor Jerome Heer. He directed us to the county&rsquo;s annual fiscal reports from 2003 to 2013. Clarke was appointed sheriff in 2002, but the first full year with his own budget was in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All told, the sheriff&#39;s office will spend about $78 million this year, compared to $64 million in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the budget surpluses and deficits the office has encountered under Clarke:</p>\r\n\r\n<table dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2003</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>-$2,393,755</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2004</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1,510,200</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2005</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1,363,322</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2006</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$442,806</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2007</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1,296,949</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2008</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$52,338</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2009</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1,380,056</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2010</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$1,420,322</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2011</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>$237,127</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2012</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>-$660,579</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2013</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>-$217,000*</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">* estimated deficit as of 8/4/14</div>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the fiscal reports prepared by the Comptroller&#39;s office show Clarke&#39;s office actually had a deficit in three of the 11 years. The number for 2013 is an estimate, since the books have not been closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is a look at the three exceptions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2003</strong>: In Clarke&rsquo;s first full-year budget, the office ran a $2,393,755 deficit, because revenue from fines, forfeitures, grants and reimbursements came in nearly $2.2 million less than expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2012</strong>: &nbsp;The office was hit with another deficit, totaling $660,579. A $942,666 difference between budgeted and actual revenues contributed to the deficit for that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2013</strong>: The auditor&rsquo;s office has yet to determine final surplus and deficit figures because year-end adjustments are still &quot;firming up,&quot; Heer said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, Heer said he believes the office&#39;s final deficit will be between $162,000 and $217,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another factor to consider is Clarke&rsquo;s temporary control over the House of Correction, inheriting a <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/82840927.html\">$5 million deficit on overtime pay</a> when he took it over in January 2009. A court ruling unraveled his authority over the House of Correction in May 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Clarke took it over, the House of Correction was its own separate entity that oversaw a $45 million budget and includes about 500 employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Clarke cut the<a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/51145857.html\"> overtime spending by 70 percent </a>in his first year, two budgets sustained deficits in 2012 and 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an Aug. 1, 2014 appearance with host <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/journal-broadcast-group/milwaukee-co-sheriff-david-clarke-with-charlie-sykes\">Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM</a>, Clarke rephrased his claim a bit: &quot;I have a 10-year record where I&rsquo;ve balanced every budget or some of those years I&rsquo;ve turned back budget surpluses.
