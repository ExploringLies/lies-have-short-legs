But some animal activists are <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Justice4Harambe/timeline\">outraged</a> at the death of a <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/directory?direction=desc&amp;sort=extinction_status\">critically endangered</a> animal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One dimension of this outrage, Limbaugh said, is people think they&rsquo;re related to gorillas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A lot of people think that all of us used to be gorillas, and they&#39;re looking for the missing link out there,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2016/05/31/the_politics_of_the_gorilla_story\">Limbaugh said</a>. &quot;The evolution crowd. They think we were originally apes. I&#39;ve always had a question: If we were the original apes, then how come Harambe is still an ape, and how come he didn&#39;t become one of us?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Limbaugh has delivered mixed messages on his belief in evolution in the past. <a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2004/05/21/undeniable_truth_of_life_232\">In 2004</a>, he asked why chimpanzees and baboons &quot;got stuck being idiot gorillas&quot; instead of becoming humans. Then <a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2010/09/29/tackling_darwinism_in_literalville\">in 2010</a>, he said, &quot;clearly things evolve,&quot; while still expressing skepticism about the progression of human and primate evolution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We thought we&rsquo;d take the opportunity to answer Limbaugh&rsquo;s question and explain why the presence of gorillas doesn&rsquo;t negate the concept of <a href=\"http://humanorigins.si.edu/education/introduction-human-evolution\">evolution</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humans are apes, as members of the taxonomic family <a href=\"http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Hominidae/\">hominidae</a>, which also includes the great apes &mdash; orangutans, chimpanzees and gorillas. Humans, the great apes, monkeys and more are all <a href=\"http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/eutheria/primates.html\">primates</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4cfxI9LNVmLypqDI3aezBXL9MWxC_uO4YQ_DzUmOc9LzycDq9nbTKgCWq8xx84qp0vH-xhh3MYAL80rCdqUMoZZQ_IeM8gzUfIe6WbGPn1F1Tb0igj7CxA2oftkRa6mIz5IYLfzj\" style=\"border:none; float:left; height:425px; line-height:20.8px; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px; width:365px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, humans didn&rsquo;t evolve from gorillas or other apes, as Limbaugh suggests. Rather humans, gorillas and all other apes evolved from a common ape-like ancestor (now extinct) around 5&nbsp;million to 8&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/3996-humans-chimps-split.html\">million years ago</a>. See the primate family tree to the left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientists know this from studying the comparative anatomy and DNA for humans and other creatures, said Blythe Williams, a professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Each species has changed over time,&quot; Williams said. &quot;For reasons that are not clear, our own species has changed in some very dramatic ways, such as becoming bipedal and getting really big brained.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some experts believe this common ancestor was chimp-like, while others think it might have been different from anything currently living, said David Pilbeam, professor of human evolution at Harvard University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams said the question Limbaugh poses &mdash; why gorillas and humans coexist despite evolution &mdash; is akin to asking why Rush Limbaugh hasn&rsquo;t evolved into his cousin, <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Stephen_N._Limbaugh,_Jr.\">Stephen</a>, or vice-versa. The two share a common ancestor, but they&rsquo;re not the same person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They are different people, with some shared DNA,&quot; Williams said. &quot;But because of the introduction of other genes into their gene pool, via parents, they are not exactly the same as one another or their shared grandparent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it&rsquo;s not that there was a linear progression from gorillas to humans, and some gorillas just didn&rsquo;t evolve. It&rsquo;s that <a href=\"http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_07\">over some 6&nbsp;million years</a>, descendants of a single, common species became gorillas, and others became humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Evolution, including human evolution, doesn&#39;t have a goal beyond survival and reproduction,&quot; Pilbeam said, making the argument that becoming human isn&rsquo;t the end-all-be-all in evolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Homo sapiens are the only remaining human species, having emerged about <a href=\"http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-sapiens\">200,000 years ago</a>, though there used to be <a href=\"http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-family-tree\">numerous</a> human species, including our closest extinct relative, the <a href=\"http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-neanderthalensis\">neanderthal</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain genes differ just 1.8 percent between humans and gorillas. The difference in those genes is about 1.2 percent between humans and our <a href=\"http://www.berggorilla.org/en/gorillas/general/facts/how-closely-are-gorillas-related-to-us/\">closest animal relative</a>, the chimpanzee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Limbaugh said the presence of gorillas calls into question the concept of evolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Limbaugh hit on a common misconception that humans evolved from modern-day apes. In reality, modern-day humans and modern-day gorillas are cousins, having both evolved from a common, but now extinct, ancestor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Limbaugh&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b42f712a-3014-4819-ac8e-9e84151e6146\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b42f712a-3014-4819-ac8e-9e84151e6146</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-03T12:18:50.275262", "ruling_date": "2016-06-03T14:21:19", "ruling_headline": "Rush Limbaugh asks why Cincinnati Zoo gorilla hadn't evolved into a human", "ruling_headline_slug": "rush-limbaugh-asks-why-cincinnati-zoo-gorilla-hadn", "ruling_link_text": "Brother from another mother", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Rush Limbaugh Show, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2016/05/31/the_politics_of_the_gorilla_story\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Politics of the Gorilla Story</u></a>,&quot; May 31, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rush Limbaugh Show, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2004/05/21/undeniable_truth_of_life_232\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Undeniable Truth of Life #23,</u></a>&quot; May 21, 2004</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rush Limbaugh Show, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2010/09/29/tackling_darwinism_in_literalville\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Tackling Darwinism in Literalville,</u></a>&quot; Sept. 29, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, <a href=\"http://humanorigins.si.edu/education/introduction-human-evolution\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Introduction To Human Evolution,&quot;</u></a> accessed June 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.C.
