John McCain, R-Ariz., about the report she had just aired about American competitiveness.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Well, I think it&#39;s obviously a recognition of the reality and the trends, that cheaper, lower-cost labor products will usually prevail over the products made in higher wage and income countries,&quot; <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-sen-john-mccain/story?id=13069098&amp;page=1\">McCain said</a>. &quot;But I would also point out that, if you&#39;d emptied (a house shown in the earlier segment) -- if you&#39;d left a computer there or an iPad or an iPhone, those are built in the United States of America. And as the president said, continuously, and I agree with him, innovation is the key to us being able to restore our economy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCritics immediately jumped on McCain&rsquo;s statement that the devices &quot;are built in the United States of America.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe answer is inscribed on the back of every iPhone: &quot;Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we contacted McCain&rsquo;s office, spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan confirmed that the senator had been in error and had corrected himself in interviews later on Sunday.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Sen. McCain is aware the iPhone, iPad, and other Apple products were designed in the United States but manufactured elsewhere,&quot; said Buchanan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, one of Apple&rsquo;s key manufacturing contractors in China, Foxconn, has attracted attention over the years for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/27/technology/companies/27apple.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=foxconn&amp;st=cse\">allegations of worker abuse</a>. (Apple did not respond to an inquiry for this story.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s true that Apple, a U.S.-based company, has thrived in the global market against foreign-based competitors. But McCain was wrong to suggest that iPads and iPhones &quot;are built in the United States of America.&quot; They aren&rsquo;t.
