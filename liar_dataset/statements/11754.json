Ted Cruz&nbsp;(R-Texas) meets with attendees Tuesday, Jan. 12, 2016, during a campaign stop at Granite State Indoor Range in Hudson, N.H. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Feinstein on guns</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feinstein, by contrast, is considered a leader on gun control. In 1994, she authored the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which was signed by President Bill Clinton. It prohibited the manufacture of 19 specific kinds of military-style, semi-automatic firearms, often called assault weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also banned the manufacture and sale of gun magazines that hold more than 10 bullets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill expired in 2004 after efforts to extend it failed in Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its restrictions did not apply to any semi-automatic weapons or magazines made before the ban&rsquo;s effective date: Sept. 13, 1994.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Video of Feinstein&rsquo;s comment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interview with <em>60 Minutes</em> that aired in February 1995, correspondent Lesley Stahl asked Feinstein about this loophole, which made it legal to buy and sell hundreds of thousands of the assault weapons the senator had sought to restrict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feinstein responded: &quot;If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, &lsquo;Mr. and Mrs. America turn &lsquo;em all in,&rsquo; I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren&rsquo;t here.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz&rsquo;s campaign spokesman pointed to this statement when we asked him to back up the presidential hopeful&rsquo;s claim. It&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_LaBJvI0BI&amp;app=desktop\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>available on YouTube</u></a> as a short excerpt of the longer <em>60 Minutes</em> piece.</p>\r\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_LaBJvI0BI\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The YouTube video makes it clear that the interview is about the assault weapons ban. The term &quot;assault weapon&quot; is uttered in the first sentence, just as the video clip shows Feinstein hoisting up a semiautomatic weapon at a press conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowhere in the short piece or the <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vzEw5kVPFEwJ:ibgwww.colorado.edu/~wilsonsm/feinstein.ps\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>full interview</u></a> does Feinstein discuss banning &quot;all guns&quot; as Cruz claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feinstein does say in the TV interview that she wanted to ban all <em>assault weapons</em>, regardless of when they were made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She again made that point in a speech on the U.S. Senate floor several months after the <em>60 Minutes</em> interview, in December 1995:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If I had my way, I would ban the possession of assault weapons anywhere in the United States of America, but there were not going to be the votes for that,&quot; she said, according to a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/11/senate-section/article/s18307-1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>transcript </u></a>in the Congressional Record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feinstein has outlined her support for legal gun ownership in many ways, including during the effort to renew the assault weapons ban.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let me be clear: If an individual wants to purchase a weapon for hunting or self-defense, I support that right,&quot; Feinstein wrote in an <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Feinstein-presses-for-assault-weapons-ban-3741632.php\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>op-ed</u></a> in the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> in July 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz has claimed multiple times that Feinstein stated her desire to tell Americans &quot;I want all of your guns,&quot; or&nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m rounding &#39;em up.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked to show evidence of the claim, Cruz&rsquo;s spokesman pointed to a short segment of a <em>60 Minutes</em> piece that centered on Feinstein&rsquo;s assault weapons ban from two decades ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Feinstein calls for an &quot;outright ban&quot; in the excerpt, a reasonable look at that sound bite, and a transcript of the full <em>60 Minutes</em> interview, shows Feinstein is not referring to banning &quot;all guns.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, she&rsquo;s relaying that she failed to achieve her desired full ban on assault weapons.<em> </em>The full TV segment details a large loophole in the law that allows the sale and purchase of assault weapons made before the ban went into effect. Feinstein&rsquo;s statement is clearly in response to concerns over that loophole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Cruz&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-01-13T18:20:49.233275", "ruling_date": "2016-01-15T13:01:16", "ruling_headline": "Ted Cruz misfires on Feinstein gun claim", "ruling_headline_slug": "ted-cruz-misfires-feinstein-gun-claim", "ruling_link_text": "Gaping hole in Texas senator's claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Sen.
