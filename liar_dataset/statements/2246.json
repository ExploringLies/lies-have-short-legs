The plan also proposes longer license suspensions, including a new type of suspension that would still allow offenders to drive to work.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen <font>Archambault </font><font>recalled seeing</font> statistics suggesting that 4 out of 10 fatal accidents in Rhode Island involved alcohol. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t be at the top of the country for alcohol-related fatalities,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut is Rhode Island really the <font><font>worst in the country for DWI fatalities? </font></font><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked the Archambault campaign for the source of its numbers. They referred us to <a href=\"http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pubs/811172.pdf\" id=\"e.x1\" title=\"a 2009 report\">a 2009 report</a> from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#39;s National Center for Statistics and Analysis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt turns out that Rhode Island is not number one, but we&#39;re up there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor 2008, the latest year for which statistics are available, the state ranked 5th out of the 50 states when it came to motor vehicle fatalities in which a driver was at the legal limit of .08 or higher.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThirty-eight percent of our 69 driving fatalities that year involved someone who was drunk. That&#39;s very close to the 4 out of 10 cited by Archambault. Only Hawaii (39 percent), Montana (40 percent), Wyoming (42 percent) and North Dakota (46 percent) had a worse record.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<font>Apparently our ranking can bounce around. In 2007, Rhode Island was right at the national average of 32 percent, but that doesn&#39;t happen often. </font><a href=\"http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/810616.pdf\" id=\"r5fs\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" title=\"In 2005\">In 2005</a><font> we ranked 11th, and </font><a href=\"http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/810801.pdf\" id=\"kmh.\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" title=\"in 2006\">in 2006</a><font> we were 10th.</font><br />\r\n\t<br style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" />\r\n\tBut in <a href=\"http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/809761.pdf\" id=\"p650\" title=\"2003\">2003</a> and <a href=\"http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/809905.pdf\" id=\"nds9\" title=\"2004\">2004,</a> we were ranked first in the nation in the percentage of fatalities related to alcohol.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tArchambault isn&#39;t completely correct about our ranking, unless you go back several years.
