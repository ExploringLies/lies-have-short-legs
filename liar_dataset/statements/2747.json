The ads vary a bit, sometimes doubling up the targets, but all follow the same theme.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Do you refuse to get a job? Looking for a free ride?&quot; a narrator asks in <a href=\"http://www.wmc.org/PDFfiles/video/SD5_Sullivan_FreeRide.mov\">one of the ads</a>. &quot;Well, Jim Sullivan says, Come to Wisconsin. No job? No problem! Don&rsquo;t pay taxes? Don&rsquo;t worry about it!&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen comes the punch line:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Jim Sullivan&rsquo;s been working hard to raise taxes on Wisconsin workers by another $510 a month so freeloaders can get free state-run health care.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhoa.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor some workers, that&rsquo;s a car payment or two worth of higher taxes every month. And &quot;freeloaders&quot; is, well, a pretty loaded word.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, let&rsquo;s see what Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce is talking about.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ads cite votes by the four Democrats for Senate Bill 40, which was the Senate version of the 2007-&rsquo;09 state budget and included &quot;Healthy Wisconsin.&quot; The proposal would have provided health coverage to nearly all state residents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSenate Bill 40 died after being approved by the Senate. It faced opposition from Assembly Republicans and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, who <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/31958679.html\">said at the </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/31958679.html\">time</a> he had to live in the &quot;real world&quot; of ideas that could become law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s examine the two parts of the major claim in the ads:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The Senate Democrat&rsquo;s plan would have raised &quot;taxes on Wisconsin workers by another $510 a month ...&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe proposal was to be funded through a payroll tax. The average monthly cost would have been $370 for employers and $140 for employees, or a total of $510, according to the Senate Democrats&rsquo; <a href=\"http://www.legis.state.wi.us/senate/sen27/news/HealthyWI/HealthyWisconsin.asp\">summary</a> of the plan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen asked why the ads claim the full tax would have been picked up by workers, WMC policy analyst R.J. Pirlot told PolitiFact Wisconsin: &quot;It ultimately comes out of the worker&rsquo;s pocket.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s one view of it. But clearly $510 per month would not have been deducted from paychecks, as the ads suggest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow the second part.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&quot; ... so freeloaders can get free state-run health care.&quot;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Freeloaders&quot; means people who don&rsquo;t work, said WMC spokesman Jim Pugh.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIndeed, WMC&rsquo;s ad against Jauch -- unlike the ones against Sullivan, Lehman and Kreitlow -- is explicit on that point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat ad says &quot;Healthy Wisconsin&quot; was &quot;like ObamaCare, only worse. It would cost us $510 a month, but it&rsquo;s free for people who move here and refuse to work.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs that right? Only to a point.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Healthy Wisconsin&quot; would have covered state residents and out-of-state residents working in Wisconsin, except those already covered by plans such as Medicare, Medicaid and BadgerCare, according to the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnemployed people would have been eligible for health care under the proposal. So would new unemployed residents, after living in Wisconsin for one year -- although that waiting period would have been waived for pregnant women. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s punch the clock on this item.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith a focus on key state Senate seats, Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce is airing ads against four Democrats for their votes on a failed universal health care plan. Citing a $510 a month cost, the ads overstate how much the plan would have raised payroll taxes on workers. As for the second half of the charge -- that &quot;freeloaders&quot; would get free care -- unemployed Wisconsin residents would have qualified, as long as they&rsquo;d been state residents for at least a year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim as Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-29T19:53:26.748370", "ruling_date": "2010-10-30T09:01:00", "ruling_headline": "Group says four Wisconsin senators voted to raise taxes on workers so \u201cfreeloaders\u201d can get free health care", "ruling_headline_slug": "group-says-four-wisconsin-senators-voted-raise-tax", "ruling_link_text": "Workers wouldn't have picked up the full tab, but plan did propose free benefits to the unemployed", "ruling_state": "Wisconsin", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tInterviews with Carrie Lynch, Wisconsin Senate Democratic Committee spokesman, Oct. 27 and 28, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews with Jim Pugh and R.J.
