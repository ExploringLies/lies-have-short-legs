Healey Jr. likes to wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the other candidates campaigned for months and spent millions in the most expensive governor&rsquo;s race in Rhode Island history, Healey didn&rsquo;t enter the contest until shortly after the September primary, when he replaced the Moderate Party&rsquo;s original candidate, who was unable to run because of illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Healey, who has repeatedly run for lieutenant governor with the intention of abolishing the office, and who spent the 2002 election season handing out campaign condoms with the slogan &quot;Nothing never felt so good,&quot; got 21.4 percent of the vote after mail ballots were counted in the 2014 gubernatorial election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the major party candidates, Democrat Gina Raimondo and Republican Allan Fung, saturated the airwaves with commercials, Healey made a few campaign appearances and put up a few signs. But his performance in televised debates in October won him support from a lot of people who like his unconventional style -- or didn&rsquo;t much like Fung or Raimondo, who won the race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day after the election, Healey told Providence Journal columnist Edward Fitzpatrick that he <a href=\"http://www.providencejournal.com/writers/edward-fitzpatrick/20141105-ed-fitzpatrick-how-did-healey-get-22-in-r.i.-governors-race-with-just-36-poll.ece\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>spent just $36.29</u></a> on his campaign. He made <a href=\"http://www.630wpro.com/2014/11/05/news-healey-im-an-equal-opportunity-spoiler/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a similar claim on WPRO</u></a>, where morning host Gene Valicenti congratulated him on his strong showing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Thank you. For 35, for 38 bucks, not bad,&quot; Healey said. &quot;I probably should have spent twice as much. I would have doubled my numbers and maybe be the governor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Valicenti joked that he didn&#39;t count gas money. &quot;I know,&quot; Healey responded. &quot;(But) I had to go there anyway.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Moderate Party candidate -- who also founded the Cool Moose Party -- has cited similar numbers in other venues. That prompted a reader to question the accuracy of Healey&#39;s statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Someone had to spend money for those garish signs over I-195. And those signs weren&#39;t cheap,&quot; the reader said. Indeed, there were more than a few Healey signs throughout the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Healey&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.ricampaignfinance.com/ExportDocs/2850-RICF2-140625-63438c68-2bb9-4fa1-b057-7ce914d7cd6a.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>most recent filing</u></a> with the Rhode Island Board of Elections, for the period ending Oct. 27, 2014, shows that he raised no money and spent nothing during the previous 20 days. <a href=\"http://ricampaignfinance.com/ExportDocs/2850-RICF2-140624-2b151998-8165-4453-9820-989ba1ceef6a.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>His previous report</u></a> shows that he gave himself $35.31 and spent it all on cell phone expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Healey told us the amount jumps to $36.29 when you add the price of the only two purchases he made since his last financial report -- a pair of postage stamps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filings for the Moderate Party itself show that it spent no money on Healey&#39;s race either, at least through Oct. 27.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So where did the money for the signs come from?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Healey said a lot of supporters downloaded the public-domain images of <a href=\"http://www.votehealey.com/images.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>him and his artwork</u></a> from his website &quot;so anybody could produce anything.&quot; They printed their own. In addition, a local sign maker printed up his own signs and sold them at cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The candidate also recycled signs from his past campaigns for lieutenant governor. &quot;We just crossed out the word &#39;lieutenant&#39; and gave those away,&quot; said Healey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also painted a campaign message on the wall of a building using old black paint. He initially had trouble opening the cans of Rust-Oleum paint because the covers had rusted shut. &quot;I found that rather ironic. They should make cans that don&#39;t rust,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, &quot;I didn&#39;t spend any money on signs. Not at all,&quot; Healey asserted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, &quot;people printed up a ton of T-shirts. I don&#39;t know what people did with them. But we&#39;re creating small business in Rhode Island. We&#39;re giving people jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We recycled everything -- anything I could cross out the word &#39;lieutenant.&#39; We recycled buttons. We had some old bumper stickers from when I ran for governor in &#39;98. In the attic, I found a case of Cool Moose combs, which I had in &#39;86. Yardsticks,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And did he have any leftover condoms?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We did, but they all expired in 2003. We didn&#39;t want to be giving out expired condoms.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when Robert Healey says he spent only about $36 on his campaign, all the evidence points to a truly shoestring operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>True</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>PolitiFact Rhode Island</u></a> to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
