Pundits on CNN chewed over the matter recently, with one conservative arguing they shouldn&rsquo;t try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think we&#39;re missing one important point here. Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans,&quot; <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1601/12/se.01.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>said Mike Rogers</u></a>, a former Republican congressman from Michigan and CNN&#39;s national security commentator, on Jan. 12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rogers said people who don&#39;t see this are &quot;missing the folks on the street who are drawn to his campaign. He&#39;s got this whole group of Democrats for Trump, it&#39;s an economic issue. &hellip; This is a Republican Party attracting Democrats, independents, Reagan Democrats to a message that says this town is broken. The institutions of government are broken. The economy is broken.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were intrigued by the idea that Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans, so we asked Rogers&#39; office for his sources. We also checked some national polls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First stop: the <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2016/01/08/fox-news-poll-national-presidential-race-obama-ratings/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>latest Fox News Poll,</u></a> jointly conducted by a Democratic and Republican polling firm from Jan. 4 to 7. The results were reported four days before Rogers&#39; statement. It surveyed 1,006 registered voters by phone and found that in a matchup with Hillary Clinton, Trump&#39;s level of support was 84 percent among Republican but only 9 percent among Democrats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2311\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>latest Quinnipiac poll</u></a> to look at the question, conducted Dec. 16-20 among 1,140 registered voters, found that while 82 percent of Republicans would support Trump, only 4 percent of Democrats would vote for him in a matchup with Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Democratic support for Trump doesn&#39;t come close to his level seen among Republican voters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Rogers about his sources, his spokeswoman sent us two articles, one from the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/upshot/donald-trumps-strongest-supporters-a-certain-kind-of-democrat.html?_r=3\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u><em>New York Times</em></u></a>&nbsp;and the other an opinion piece from <em><a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-01-08/new-poll-shows-donald-trump-is-a-real-threat-to-hillary-clinton\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>U.S. News &amp; World Report</u></a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Times </em>analysis is based on surveys by Civis Analytics of more than 11,000 people who say they lean Republican. Trump&#39;s support was 43 percent among Republicans who are still registered as Democrats. But that group makes up only 8 percent of the respondents who said they tend to support the GOP, and Civis spokeswoman Lisa Kornblatt told us no Democrats were included in the survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arguing that Civis polling shows that Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans &quot;is a misrepresentation of our data,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mercuryanalytics.com/category/our-articles/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The results from Mercury Analytics</u></a>, cited in the <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report </em>opinion piece, found that a hefty 19 percent of likely Democratic voters&nbsp;would cross party lines and vote for Trump if the election were held when the online survey was conducted, January 6-8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, in contrast, Trump was supported by 73 percent of Republicans, making him nearly four times more popular among Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If the claim was truly &#39;Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans,&#39; this is completely untrue &ndash; ridiculous,&quot; Mercury CEO Ron Howard wrote in an email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mercury poll also found that 14 percent of likely Republican voters said they would vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN commentator and former congressman Mike Rogers said, &quot;Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A January 2016 Fox News poll found Trump was nine times more popular among Republicans than Democrats, when matched up against Clinton. A December 2015 Quinnipiac poll found that the billionaire was 20 times more popular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rogers, in contrast, cited one survey that didn&#39;t even poll people who said they leaned Democrat and another that found Democrat support for Trump was only about one quarter of what it was among Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The relevant numbers render Roger&#39;s assertion ridiculous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Pants on Fire</u></a>!</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-01-21T14:49:11.129211", "ruling_date": "2016-01-21T14:08:21", "ruling_headline": "Mike Rogers says Trump appeals to Democrats as much as Republicans", "ruling_headline_slug": "mike-rogers-says-trump-appeals-democrats-much-repu", "ruling_link_text": "Surveys say, this one goes down in flames", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1601/12/se.01.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.6; text-decoration: none;\"><u>CNN Live Event/Special</u></a>&quot; transcript, aired Jan. 12, 2016 at 21:00 ET, accessed Jan. 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FoxNews.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2016/01/08/fox-news-poll-national-presidential-race-obama-ratings/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Fox News Poll: National presidential race, Obama ratings</u></a>,&quot; Jan. 8, 2016, accessed Jan. 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quinnipiac.edu, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2311\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Half Of U.S. Voters Embarrassed With Trump As President, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; Trump At Top Of GOP Pack, But Cruz Closes In</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 22, 2015, accessed Jan. 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails, Amanda Nunez, Communications Manager, Mike Rogers, Jan. 14-21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. News &amp; World Report, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-01-08/new-poll-shows-donald-trump-is-a-real-threat-to-hillary-clinton\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Trump Could Win It All</u></a>,&quot; Jan. 8, 2016, accessed Jan. 15, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/upshot/donald-trumps-strongest-supporters-a-certain-kind-of-democrat.html?_r=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Donald Trump&#39;s Strongest Supporters: A Certain Kind of Democrat</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 31, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mercury Analytics, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.mercuryanalytics.com/category/our-articles/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hillary Clinton vs. Donald Trump - A Tough Battle</u></a>,&quot; Jan. 9, 2016, accessed Jan. 17, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Lisa Kornblatt, director of communications, Civis Analytics, Jan. 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Ron Howard, CEO, Mercury Analytics, Jan. 17, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails, Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, Jan. 21, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Doug Schwartz, executive director, Quinnipiac University Poll, Jan. 21, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "national security commentator for CNN", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Mike ", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Michigan", "id": 2333, "last_name": "Rogers", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "mike-rogers", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rogers_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2333/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.mikerogers.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a roundtable discussion on CNN", "statement_date": "2016-01-12", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 194, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/194/", "subject": "Polls and Public Opinion", "subject_slug": "polls", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 104, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/104/", "subject": "Pundits", "subject_slug": "pundits", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
