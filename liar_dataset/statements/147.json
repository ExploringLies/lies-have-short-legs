Obama's 4,000-word speech spends about two paragraphs on Iran and Syrian; its main purpose was to argue for withdrawing from Iraq.\n</p>\n<p>\n After discussing the need to reduce troops and increase diplomacy, Obama outlines a number of possible scenarios, including sending more troops to Afghanistan. After that, he says the reduced forces in Iraq would still have a role to play in sending a message to Iran and Syria.\n</p>\n<p>\n But it's an exagerration to say that he has dramatically switched positions.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Clinton campaign is right when it asserts that there is little difference between Clinton and Obama on Iran policy. Both advocate aggressive diplomacy and economic sanctions, and both say a military strategy cannot be ruled out.\n</p>\n<p>\n But selectively quoting Obama from the November speech is a weak point for this argument, so we rate this claim Half-True.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:33.716280", "ruling_date": "2007-10-29T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Cherry-picking Obama's quotes", "ruling_headline_slug": "cherry-picking-obamas-quotes", "ruling_link_text": "Cherry-picking Obama's quotes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "Hillary Clinton campaign, Memo: Obama vs. Obama: The Real Differences on Iran, Oct. 25, 2007.\n<p>\n Barack Obama,\n <a href=\"http://obama.senate.gov/speech/061120-a_way_forward_i/\">\n  A Way Forward in Iraq,\n </a>\n speech given to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Nov. 20, 2006.\n</p>\n<p>\n <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00349\">\n  Roll call vote on the Kyl-LiebermanAmendment,\n </a>\n Sept. 26, 2007.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Jerusalem Post,\n <a href=\"http://www.blogcentral.jpost.com/index.php?cat_id=9&amp;blog_id=73&amp;blog_post_id=1187\">\n  How would you grapple with Iran's nuclear drive?,\n </a>\n June 7, 2007.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "Sen.
