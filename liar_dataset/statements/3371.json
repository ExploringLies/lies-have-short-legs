Rick Perry&rsquo;s Feb. 8 call on higher education to devise a way that students could earn bachelor&rsquo;s degrees at a cost of $10,000, including textbooks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;As for the governor&rsquo;s preposterous scheme to serve up $10,000 college degrees, nobody in higher education believes that is even possible,&quot; Andy Brown writes. &quot;Tuition and books for a single year easily add up to that amount, and tuition likely will increase in the face of state funding cuts.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGranted, four years in college costs a bundle. But no one believes a $10K degree is even possible?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe reached Brown, who said by e-mail that there is &quot;probably someone out there who thinks it is possible at most Texas institutions, so the word &lsquo;credible&rsquo; probably should have been included as a modifier&quot; after nobody. &quot;Regardless, it&#39;s not a realistic option for most higher ed institutions in Texas,&quot; Brown said, &quot;and for Perry to imply otherwise is ridiculous.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext, we read news accounts following Perry&rsquo;s State of the State address. Skepticism and uncertainty abound, the reports suggest. &nbsp;On Feb. 10, the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> quoted state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, who chairs the Senate Higher Education Committee, saying that it&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmong officials in higher education, Mike McKinney, chancellor of the Texas A&amp;M University System, was quoted in the Feb. 12 <em>Austin American-Statesman </em>as telling state senators he has no idea how to meet Perry&rsquo;s goal. The newspaper said McKinney also testified: &quot;I&#39;m not going to say that it can&#39;t be done.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA <em>Houston Chronicle</em> news article, likewise published Feb. 12, says some education leaders say a $10,000 degree could be achieved at community colleges. The article quotes Bruce Leslie, chancellor of the San Antonio-based Alamo Colleges, saying: &quot;&quot;We already have the facilities, the infrastructure, the doctorate faculty. You could take community colleges and do that without building a whole new infrastructure, or forcing existing four-year universities to downsize.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe story quotes Shirley Reed, president of South Texas College in McAllen, saying: &quot;It is an idea that is long overdue.&quot; At the college, resident tuition for 120 credit-hours--which colleges typically require to earn a degree--is currently about $7,600, according to its website. According to a Feb. 10 Texas Tribune news article, South Texas College and two other community colleges are already authorized to offer a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Applied Technology, costing in the range of $10,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext, we asked the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board if anyone in higher education has rated the $10,000 degree possible. Spokesman Dominic Chavez replied by e-mail: &quot;We interpret the $10,000 degree challenge by the governor as just that&mdash;a challenge...The question from the board&rsquo;s perspective is not &lsquo;is $10,000 the right target or a reasonable target?&rsquo; but rather &lsquo;what can we do to get as close to it as possible?&rsquo;&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor national perspective, we contacted Beth Hagan, executive director of the Florida-based Community College Baccalaureate Association, which seeks to improve access to bachelor&rsquo;s degrees. Hagan told us bachelor&rsquo;s degrees costing $10,000 are now available through community colleges in 17 states. However, she said, they generally aren&rsquo;t in the academic studies available through four-year universities. Besides, she cautioned, very few community college students get the four-year &quot;niche&quot; degrees, which tend to involve technologies or special skills such as nursing or teaching.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHagan said of Perry&rsquo;s proposal: &quot;If you asked a group of (community) college administrators and presidents if this could be done, they would laugh at you. Of course, it&rsquo;s possible.&quot; But Perry&rsquo;s call, she said, was akin to challenging a chain steakhouse to offer $1 hamburgers. &quot;Can they do it? Sure. But they don&rsquo;t want to.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerry&rsquo;s communications director, Mark Miner, called Brown&rsquo;s statement unfortunate, adding that it&rsquo;s &quot;just like the establishment to say it can&rsquo;t be done, without trying.&quot; Catherine Frazier, Perry&rsquo;s deputy press secretary, pointed out a Feb. 10 <a href=\"http://www.mywesttexas.com/top_stories/article_3f7cf265-f3aa-5bab-8d47-ba080c4eec27.html\">news article </a>in the <em>Midland Reporter-Telegram</em> describing Midland College&rsquo;s applied technology bachelor&rsquo;s degree, which the article says can be earned for about $10,000. The article also says the program might not be funded in the next state budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo doubt, there&rsquo;s skepticism in higher education about Perry&rsquo;s call. But it&rsquo;s a stretch to say nobody believes $10,000 degrees possible. Four-year technology degrees at around that price point are already an option for some Texas students.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Brown&rsquo;s statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-03-07T12:45:28.884670", "ruling_date": "2011-03-08T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Andy Brown says nobody in higher education believes $10,000 bachelor's degree is possible", "ruling_headline_slug": "andy-brown-says-nobody-higher-education-believes-1", "ruling_link_text": "Not impossible, perhaps unlikely", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAustin American-Statesman, news article, <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/texas-politics/perrys-call-for-10-000-bachelors-degrees-stumps-1248814.html\">&quot;Perry&#39;s call for $10,000 bachelor&#39;s degrees stumps educators,&quot;</a> Feb. 11, 2011 (accessed Feb. 22, 2011)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAndy Brown, web post, Travis County Democratic Party, <a href=\"http://www.traviscountydemocrats.org/2011/02/slashing-education-is-just-plain-stupid/\">&quot;Slashing education is just plain stupid!,&quot;</a> Feb. 22, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDallas Morning News, news article, <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/texas-legislature/headlines/20110210-perrys-idea-for-cheap-college-degree-unrealistic-experts-say.ece%20\">&quot;Perry&rsquo;s idea for cheap college degree unrealistic, experts say,&quot;</a> Feb. 11, 2011 (accessed Feb. 22, 2011)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/02232011_dominicchavezrsponsepftexas.html\">E-mail (excerpted)</a>, response to PolitiFact Texas, Dominic Chavez, senior director, Office of External Relations, Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, Feb. 23, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Houston Chronicle, news article, <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7425146.html%20\">&quot;Community collegse answer Perry&rsquo;s call,&quot;</a> Feb. 12, 2011 (accessed Feb. 22, 2011)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Beth Hood, executive director, Community College Baccalaureate Association, Bonita Springs, Florida, Feb. 23, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Oscar Plaza, chairman, technology management program, South Texas College, McAllen, Feb. 25, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMidland Reporter-Telegram, news article, <a href=\"http://www.mywesttexas.com/top_stories/article_3f7cf265-f3aa-5bab-8d47-ba080c4eec27.html\">&quot;MC: Bachelor of Applied Technology program meets Perry&#39;s call for $10,000 degrees,&quot;</a> Feb. 10, 2011 (accessed Feb. 22, 2011)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSouth Texas College, web pages, <a href=\"http://finance.southtexascollege.edu/businessoffice/cashier_tuition.html\">&quot;Tuition&quot;</a> and <a href=\"http://www.southtexascollege.edu/academics/degcerts/index.html\">&quot;Degrees and Certificates&quot;</a> (accessed Feb. 24, 2011)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Texas Tribune, news article, <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/texas-education/higher-education/texas-has-a-10000-degree--but-for-how-long/\">&quot;Texas Has a $10,000 Degree &mdash; But for How Long?&quot;</a> Feb. 10, 2011 (accessed Feb. 22, 2011)</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Attorney", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Andy", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 1070, "last_name": "Brown", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "andy-brown", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/andybrown2011.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1070/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": "https://twitter.com/AndyBrownTX"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays nobody in higher education believes Gov.
