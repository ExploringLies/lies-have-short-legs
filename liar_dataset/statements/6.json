And it's likely that they felt some pressure from liberal Democrats -- including Dodd --  who strongly favor withdrawal.\n</p>\n<p>\n But Dodd exaggerates his role. He is just one of nine co-sponsors of the amendment widely called the Feingold-Reid amendment, usually without Dodd's name attached. And both Clinton and Obama have advocated other troop withdrawl proposals before endorsing this one.
