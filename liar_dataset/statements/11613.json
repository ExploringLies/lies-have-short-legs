Some latched onto to one incident: a swastika found smeared on a bathroom wall in a campus residence hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter Kinder, Missouri&rsquo;s lieutenant governor and a GOP candidate for governor, appeared on the conservative radio show &quot;Breitbart News Daily&quot; on Nov. 12 to speak about the racial turmoil on the campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was asked by host Stephen K. Bannon, &quot;Are there any facts?&quot; Kinder replied that evidence of racism is slim. As an example, he talked about the swastika incident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This incident of supposed feces depicting a swastika on the wall of a bathrooms in one of the halls &hellip; has been supported by zero fact,&quot; Kinder said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zero fact? We had to look into that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to Kinder&rsquo;s press secretary regarding this claim. We didn&#39;t hear back from him until after this story first published, but during Kinder&rsquo;s talk on Breitbart, he cited two sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2015/11/10/was-the-poop-swastika-incident-at-mizzou-a-giant-hoax/\" target=\"_blank\">first was an article by The Federalist published Nov. 10</a>, which originally began as an attempt to prove the swastika was a hoax. Two days after the article was published, it was updated to include information about a police report of the incident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;On Thursday afternoon, pursuant to a public records request previously filed by The Federalist, the University of Missouri<a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2015/11/12/mizzou-releases-photos-of-poop-swastika-discloses-details-of-previously-unreported-racial-slurs/\">released photos of the incident</a>,&quot; it read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second article Kinder mentions is a Fox Sports article written by Clay Travis. This article&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/outkick-the-coverage/is-the-entire-mizzou-protest-based-on-lies-111115\">focused on the question:</a>What if the MU protests were based on lies? In the article, Travis originally said there&rsquo;s no evidence of the swastika drawn in feces, but later he updated the story to include the police report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to Department of Residential Life Director Frankie Minor for more information, and he sent us to MU spokesman Christian Basi, who provided the police report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUPD filed the report about an incident that occurred on Oct. 24. The report describes the incident as &quot;vandalism.&quot; At the end of the report an officer provides a narrative of what he saw when he entered the restroom of Gateway Hall. &quot;I noticed there was a swastika drawn on the wall by someone using feces,&quot; the report reads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You <a href=\"http://www.columbiamissourian.com/fact-check-kinder-s-zero-fact-on-swastika-wrong/article_151a52fc-8efc-11e5-ba1d-3bbc27605185.html\">can see the entire report here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also looked at media reports about the incident. <em>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/higher_education/update-swastika-drawn-with-human-feces-found-in-mu-residence/article_4f9c57f0-7f4c-11e5-9f88-a324bf705d1d.html\">Columbia Missourian</a>, The Maneater, Columbia Daily Tribune</em>, KOMU and others reported Oct. 30 that at 2 a.m. on Oct. 24, staff members in the Department of Residential Life found a swastika drawn in feces in the bathroom of Gateway Hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Residence Hall Association President Billy Donley released a statement critical of Residential Life&rsquo;s response. He found out via a flier in the hall.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This&nbsp;tweet was posted on the evening of Oct. 29.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We will not stay silent.

At the time the police report was made public, the lieutenant governor realized it was a real incident that happened, and he stopped referring to it as a potential hoax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There was no intention to purposefully mislead. He based it on information he had at the time.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kinder made his &quot;zero fact&quot; statement 19 days after the swastika was discovered, and 12 days after its discovery was reported by multiple news outlets, including the <em>Missourian, The Columbia Daily Tribune, the Jefferson City News Tribune</em>, the Associated Press and every local television station in the Columbia-Jefferson City market. These stories were based on information supplied by the MU Police Department and the MU News Bureau. On Nov. 6, then-Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin issued a letter condemning the swastika and other forms of hate speech. His response was also widely reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sources Kinder cites updated their articles on Nov. 12 to include the police report. Although Kinder&rsquo;s spokesman said the lieutenant governor stopped saying there was no evidence of a swastika after those two websites updated their stories, the majority of local news sources reported its existence based statements from named MU officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Kinder&rsquo;s claim Pants On Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-11-22T12:01:01.926143", "ruling_date": "2015-11-22T12:05:50", "ruling_headline": "Missouri politician wrongly claims 'zero' evidence of swastika incident on Missouri campus", "ruling_headline_slug": "missouri-politician-wrongly-claims-zero-evidence-s", "ruling_link_text": "Evidence always existed", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Lt.
