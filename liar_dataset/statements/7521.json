The system expects to bring in about <a href=\"http://www.cobbk12.org/SPLOST/splost4_1pgInfoSheet.pdf\">$717.8 million</a> in tax collections to pay for a host of capital projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOpponents of the program say the project list includes unnecessary items that the district &quot;wants&quot; but doesn&rsquo;t need, and that E-SPLOST renewals have become the &quot;<a href=\"http://www.allnews1067.com/common/page.php?pt=Will+Cobb+Voters+Extend+the+ESPLOST%3F&amp;id=1243&amp;is_corp=0\">crack cocaine</a>&quot; of the school system. School system administrators and tax supporters argue that the tax is a good alternative to property tax increases. In addition to that, supporters say, the E-SPLOST has long helped the system&rsquo;s bottom line by providing money to pay off long-term debts and avoid new bond debt for system projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Cobb is also one of the largest school systems that is debt free,&quot; education activist JoEllen Smith said in a newspaper <a href=\"http://mdjonline.com/bookmark/21785972/article-Ed-SPLOST%20passage%20won%E2%80%99t%20raise%20sales%20tax#.USdnIQFlePA.facebook\">editorial</a> published in a local paper last month. &quot;If SPLOST doesn&rsquo;t pass, bonds will have to be issued or reserves used.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia wondered if that enviable position was indeed true. It&rsquo;s hard for most people to pay off personal consumer debt, let alone a school system responsible for funding the educational needs of just over 108,000 students.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe district, the second largest in the state, has an 11-minute website <a href=\"http://www.cobbk12.org/SPLOST/\">video</a> that includes the debt-free claim. And some Kennesaw businessmen, Jay Cunningham of Superior Plumbing and John Loud of Loud Security Systems, are featured in a SPLOST advocacy <a href=\"http://kennesaw.patch.com/articles/kennesaw-businessmen-in-pro-splost-video\">video</a> also making the debt claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSmith is a volunteer for EmpowerED Georgia, a group of parents and teachers that estimates its membership at 3,500. She and Cobb Schools spokesman Jay Dillon pointed us to a 2010 census education finance <a href=\"http://www2.census.gov/govs/school/10f33pub.pdf\">report</a>. That report, issued in June 2012, was taken from 2010 <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/govs/school/\">data tables</a> that were updated in November 2012 and collected from each state. Using the updated data, Cobb is listed as the 23rd-largest school system in the country (of the more than 14,000 listed) based on enrollment. Gwinnett County Public Schools -- Georgia&rsquo;s largest school system -- is ranked 14th.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report shows that Cobb has zero long-term outstanding debt at the end of the fiscal year. The system also has no short-term debt, Dillon said. Gwinnett is not in the same fortunate financial position as Cobb. Gwinnett still has almost $580 million in debt on the books to be paid off, a schools spokesman told us. That county funds its construction projects through a portion of property tax collections, and will use current E-SPLOST revenue to pay off bonds that were used to finance some projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe census report showed that Clayton County was the only other metro Atlanta school system without any long-term debt. Clayton County Public Schools, ranked 88th in size, paid off its last bond debt as part of a SPLOST passed in 1998, a district spokesman told PolitiFact Georgia.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCobb&rsquo;s current five-year E-SPLOST expires Dec. 31, 2013. Approval from voters next week would keep the sales tax collections continuous through 2018. The money is expected to pay for several new gyms, theaters and wings, along with 407 new classrooms, at schools throughout the district.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGetting approval from voters could be a challenge. In 2011, a four-year extension of the county&rsquo;s SPLOST for parks, recreation and road renovation throughout Cobb passed by only 79 votes. And a 10-year regional transportation SPLOST failed in Cobb by almost 38 percentage points.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPaying for capital projects, like new schools and classroom expansions, with E-SPLOST funds is quite common in Georgia, said Herb Garrett, executive director of the Georgia School Superintendents Association.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBefore the E-SPLOST legislation was passed, school systems had to pay for projects through their operating funds intended for day-to-day expenses, or through bonds. Under the bond method, the money was immediately available but was paid back with interest over several years, instead of the pay-as-you-go method of financing projects with E-SPLOST collections.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing E-SPLOST funds, Cobb Schools paid off $184 million in bond debt in 2007. The school system has incurred no additional debt since then, meaning it has no outstanding bonds or loans, a state Education Department spokeswoman told us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The SPLOST program has allowed a rapidly growing state to meet its need for school buildings,&quot; Garrett said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo what&rsquo;s the fiscal fallout?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEducation activist and education sales tax supporter JoEllen Smith said that Cobb County Schools is one of the largest systems in the nation that is debt free.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe district is the second largest in the state, and is the 23rd largest in the country, according to the Census Bureau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCobb Schools has used previous sales tax collections to pay off long-term bond debt, which education experts said is common practice in Georgia. This pay-as-you-go system of funding projects has kept the county school system debt free.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rated Smith&rsquo;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-03-14T15:51:52.303911", "ruling_date": "2013-03-15T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Cobb E-SPLOST advocate uses no-debt argument", "ruling_headline_slug": "cobb-e-splost-advocates-use-no-debt-argument", "ruling_link_text": "System is in the black", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tMarietta Daily Journal, &quot;<a href=\"http://mdjonline.com/bookmark/21785972/article-Ed-SPLOST%20passage%20won%E2%80%99t%20raise%20sales%20tax#.USdnIQFlePA.facebook\">Ed-SPLOST</a><a href=\"http://mdjonline.com/bookmark/21785972/article-Ed-SPLOST%20passage%20won%E2%80%99t%20raise%20sales%20tax#.USdnIQFlePA.facebook\"> passage won&rsquo;t raise sales tax</a>,&quot; JoEllen Smith, Feb. 22, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone interview, JoEllen Smith, March 12, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone interview, Jay Dillon, spokesman, Cobb County School District, March 12, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, Public Elementary-Secondary Education Finance Data, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/govs/school/\">individual unit tables</a> for all school systems, updated Nov. 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www2.census.gov/govs/school/10f33pub.pdf\">Public Education Finances 2010</a>: Governments Division Reports, Mark Dixon, issued June 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll News 106.7, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.allnews1067.com/common/page.php?pt=Will+Cobb+Voters+Extend+the+ESPLOST%3F&amp;id=1243&amp;is_corp=0\">Will Cobb voters extend the ESPLOST?</a>&quot; March 11, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMarietta Daily Journal, &quot;<a href=\"http://mdjonline.com/view/full_story/21738691/article-Cobb-Schools-SPLOST-rhetoric-heats-up-in-run-up-to-vote\">Cobb Schools SPLOST rhetoric heats up in run-up to vote</a>,&quot; LIndsay Field, Feb. 17, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone interview, Herb Garrett, executive director, Georgia School Superintendents Association, March 13, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia secretary of state, July 31, 2012, primary election <a href=\"http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/Cobb/40412/96249/en/summary.html#\">results</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone interview, Jorge Quintana, spokesman, Gwinnett County Public Schools, March 13, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCobb County School District, <a href=\"http://www.cobbk12.org/SPLOST/\">SPLOST 4 information</a>, district website<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Clayton County Public Schools spokesman, March 13, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKennesaw Patch, &quot;<a href=\"http://kennesaw.patch.com/articles/kennesaw-businessmen-in-pro-splost-video\">Kennesaw businessmen in pro-SPLOST video</a>,&quot; Wendy Parker, March 8, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Dorie Nolt, spokeswoman, Georgia Department of Education, March 14, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "JoEllen", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 2210, "last_name": "Smith", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "joellen-smith", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/JoEllen_Smith.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2210/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 1, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tCobb is one of the largest school systems (in the nation) that is debt free.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an editorial", "statement_date": "2013-02-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 171, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/171/", "subject": "County Budget", "subject_slug": "county-budget", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 296, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/296/", "subject": "Debt", "subject_slug": "debt", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/47/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
