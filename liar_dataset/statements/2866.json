Glenn Grothman (R-West Bend) who referred to snakes charging exorbitant interest rates in recent comments about payday lenders.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPayday loan operations -- such as Check &rsquo;n Go, Payday Loan Store and Check-Cash Advance -- make short-term loans. You sign a loan agreement, write a post-dated check and get your money. The lender holds off on cashing your check until your next payday, typically two weeks.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterest rates can run high.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin has 482 payday lenders; West Bend, according to Grothman, has eight of them. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGrothman, who opposes such operations, made his <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/107830699.html\">snakes </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/107830699.html\">remark</a> in response to news that payday lenders are planning a push to roll back <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lrb/pubs/Lb/10Lb3.pdf\">regulations</a> on their business set to take effect in Wisconsin on Jan. 1, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This industry does not exist in a state like Minnesota, and I don&#39;t see any downside in keeping these usurious vipers out of our state,&quot; said Grothman, the Senate&rsquo;s new <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/sen20/news/Press/2010/pr2010-020.asp\">assistant majority leader</a>, in a Nov. 13, 2010 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. &quot;There are so many legitimate businesses in this state that need regulatory help.

For loans between $350 and $1,000, the lender cannot charge more than 33 percent interest plus a $25 fee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin also <a href=\"http://www.wdfi.org/ymm/brochures/financing/payday_loans.htm\">warns its </a><a href=\"http://www.wdfi.org/ymm/brochures/financing/payday_loans.htm\">citizens</a> about them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state Department of Financial Institutions says interest on payday loans can reach 500 percent per year or more. Borrowing $200 at 500 percent interest for two weeks costs $38.36 and; if the loan remains outstanding for 10 weeks, the cost -- $191.78 -- is nearly as much as the loan itself, according to the state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Wisconsin law that takes effect in January makes a number of changes, including limiting payday loans to $1,500. In an effort to keep consumers from accumulating too much debt, the law also limits the loans to being renewed one time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Wisconsin Deferred Deposit Association, which represents payday lenders, has said it will push to soften Wisconsin&rsquo;s new regulations, although it has not been specific about what changes it will seek.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the association, the average payday loan in Wisconsin is for $300, with a fee of $45.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere actually are many states, <a href=\"http://www.responsiblelending.org/payday-lending/policy-legislation/states/2010-CRL-US-Payday-Stores-per-Household-pdf-FINAL-Sept.pdf\">nearly a third of them</a> -- including Ohio and most of the East Coast -- that don&rsquo;t have payday lenders, according to the Center for Responsible Lending.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut as we&rsquo;ve pointed out, Minnesota isn&rsquo;t one of them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat means it&rsquo;s time for the Truth-O-Meter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState Sen.
