Part of Mandel&rsquo;s campaign strategy is to weave his military service into his candidacy, and the military images prevalent in the commercials work toward that goal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the commercials, Mandel is described as a &quot;Decorated Marine.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Decorated Marine, two-tour Iraq war vet &ndash; Josh Mandel&rsquo;s led a life of integrity and results,&quot; says the narrator for the commercial titled, &quot;Tested and Trusted.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince Mandel has attached his candidacy to his military service, we decided to check what it means to be a decorated Marine, and if Mandel fits the bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandel, a state representative from Lyndhurst, provided a list of nine medals earned during his service, including two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals he earned for his tours of Iraq.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;When you earn decorations, you&rsquo;re a decorated Marine,&quot; he said. &quot;It&rsquo;s pretty cut and dried.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe U.S. Marines Corps agreed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMajor Shawn Haney, a public affairs officer for the Marine Corps&rsquo; manpower and reserve affairs department, which maintains personnel files, confirmed Mandel had received medals that qualified him as a decorated Marine.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He has awards that he would wear,&quot; Haney said. &quot;If he calls himself a decorated Marine, he&rsquo;s not incorrect.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA decorated Marine is &quot;a Marine who receives an award during his or her service,&quot; Lt. Gregory Wolf, another media officer for the Marine Corps, told PolitiFact in an e-mail. Wolf said Mandel&rsquo;s medals put him in that category.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandel, 33, enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves in 2000, shortly before he graduated from Ohio State University. He served two tours in Iraq &ndash; one in 2004, the other in 2007-08 &ndash; for a combined 15 months. Mandel served as an intelligence specialist both times, working with other Marines to build relations with local Iraqis and figure out who among the civilians could pose a threat to troops trying to maintain peace.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandel&rsquo;s Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals are known as personal medals, meaning they were awarded for individual acts Mandel performed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe criteria for earning the achievement medal, according the Marine Corps, is for &quot;meritorious service or achievement in a combat or noncombat situation based on sustained performance or specific achievement of a superlative nature, and shall be of such merit as to warrant more tangible recognition than is possible by a fitness report or evaluation sheet, but which does not warrant a Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal or higher.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHaney, of the manpower and reserve affairs department, pointed out that Mandel&rsquo;s achievement medals, while earned in Iraq, do not include the valor device, which denotes performance in combat.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther medals he earned, such as the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, are known as unit medals, given to soldiers who participated in specific operations defined by the military.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGiven the list of medals Mandel has earned and the Marine Corps&rsquo; inclusive definition of the term &quot;decorated Marine,&quot; Mandel certainly qualifies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe find the statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-29T12:01:35.285666", "ruling_date": "2010-10-29T12:01:00", "ruling_headline": "Is Ohio treasurer candidate Josh Mandel a \u2018decorated\u2019 Marine?", "ruling_headline_slug": "ohio-treasurer-candidate-josh-mandel-decorated-mar", "ruling_link_text": "His medals back up his claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tJosh Mandel for State Treasurer, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/JoshMandeldotcom#p/u/0/FC1T-RNZyIo\">Tested and Trusted</a>,&quot; posted to YouTube Sept. 22, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with state Rep.
