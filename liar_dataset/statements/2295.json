Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson called it &quot;insensitive and inappropriate.&quot; Mike Crane, a Republican running for Congress, said it was &quot;not appropriate, decent or honorable.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublican gubernatorial nominee Nathan Deal said this: &quot;As governor, I don&#39;t want New Yorkers telling Georgians what to do with our land. I&#39;ll return the favor by staying out of their business.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Candidates differ on mosque near 9/11 site,&quot; the Daily Journal&#39;s headline concluded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat afternoon, The Associated Press posted an article with a different headline: &quot;Barnes, Deal oppose mosque near ground zero.&quot; Deal called the mosque &quot;an insult.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid Deal change his opinion on the mosque?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAJC PolitiFact Georgia switched on our trusty Flip-O-Meter, which measures whether a politician&#39;s position has shifted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeal&#39;s opinion never wavered, his spokesman Brian Robinson said. As a candidate, he knows New York&#39;s decision is outside his purview. As an American, he finds it offensive.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat Deal told the AP was simply more comprehensive than the view he expressed to The Marietta Daily Journal, Robinson said.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo verify Robinson&#39;s assertion, we reviewed Deal&#39;s public statements and contacted Daily Journal reporter Jon Gillooly, who wrote the article.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAJC PolitiFact Georgia searched for public statements by Deal on the mosque prior to the Marietta article. We found none.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter the article ran, Deal made statements to the AP and WABE, Atlanta&#39;s public radio affiliate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNeither news outlet treated Deal&#39;s statements as a shift in his position. Both said his statements &quot;went further&quot; than those he made to the Daily Journal. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we approached Gillooly, he gave us a copy of his e-mail exchange with Robinson. He also described how he reported the story and the Deal camp&#39;s response to it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Aug. 18, Gillooly e-mailed politicians asking what they thought of the mosque. The poll asked three questions:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Do you think a mosque should be allowed near Ground Zero?&quot;, &quot;Why or why not?&quot;, &quot;What&rsquo;s the alternative?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobinson and Gillooly confirmed the following:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobinson replied to the e-mail with Deal&#39;s two-sentence response. Gillooly did not ask a follow-up question. The paper printed the quote in its entirety Aug 19.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat day, Robinson complained about the headline&#39;s use of the word &quot;differ.&quot; He also asked whether Deal could expand on his statement for the online version of the story.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe paper declined to change the article and gave Deal an opportunity to write a letter to the editor. Robinson said he didn&#39;t take the paper up on its offer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat afternoon, The Associated Press sent out its own story on the subject: &quot;Barnes, Deal oppose NYC mosque.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeal said that as &quot;a potential governor of the state of Georgia&quot; he didn&#39;t have a say in what happens in New York.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I don&#39;t think government officials from one place should be telling government officials from someplace else what they ought to be doing,&quot; the Gainesville Republican said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;But as an American, I am absolutely opposed,&quot; Deal said. He called construction of the mosque two blocks from where the World Trade Center once stood &quot;an insult.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It keeps the wounds of 9/11 alive,&quot; Deal said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDeal made a similar comment to WABE.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo did Deal give an incomplete airing of his thoughts to the Marietta newspaper? Or did he actually switch positions?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlthough Deal&#39;s statements to The Marietta Daily Journal, Associated Press and WABE aren&#39;t identical, there is no evidence his opinion actually changed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere is also no indication he supported the mosque, or held no personal opinion on the mosque, prior to his interview with the Daily Journal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlus, it&#39;s possible for Deal to say without contradiction that, as a governor, he would stay out of New York&#39;s business, but personally, he opposes the mosque.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rule there was no significant change in Deal&#39;s position. In other words, No Flip.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-27T17:07:53.081922", "ruling_date": "2010-08-30T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Nathan Deal makes statements about mosque near Ground Zero", "ruling_headline_slug": "nathan-deal-makes-statements-about-mosque-near-gro", "ruling_link_text": "He's still against it, as an American", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWABE, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wabe/news.newsmain/article/0/1/1690659/Atlanta./Deal.and.Barnes.Oppose.\">Deal and Barnes Oppose &#39;Ground Zero Mosque</a>,&#39;&quot; Aug. 20, 2010,<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Marietta Daily Journal, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.mdjonline.com/view/full_story/9199492/article-Gov--candidates--differ-on-mosque-near-9-11-site?\">Gov. candidates differ on mosque near 9/11 site</a>,&quot; Aug. 19, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Marietta Daily Journal, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.mdjonline.com/view/full_story/9211874/article-Barnes--Deal-oppose-NYC-mosque?\">Barnes, Deal oppose NYC mosque</a>,&quot; Aug. 20, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t11alive.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.11alive.com/rss/rss_story.aspx?storyid=150699\">Both Barnes, Deal Oppose Mosque Near Ground Zero</a>,&quot; Aug. 19, 2010</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview, Brian Robinson, campaign spokesman, Nathan Deal for Governor, Aug. 25, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Jon Gillooly, Marietta Daily Journal reporter, Aug. 24, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 9, "current_job": "", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Nathan", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "", "id": 441, "last_name": "Deal", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "nathan-deal", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NathanDeal.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/441/", "total_count": 52, "true_count": 13, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tOn the mosque near ground zero.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a newspaper article", "statement_date": "2010-08-19", "statement_type": {"id": 4, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/4/", "statement_type": "Flip", "type_description": "Flip-o-Meter items"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 9, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/9/", "subject": "Religion", "subject_slug": "religion", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Did Nathan Deal flip-flop on the Ground Zero mosque? #gapolitics"}
