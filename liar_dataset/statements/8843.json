Who&rsquo;s going to win? Who&rsquo;s going to be the game&rsquo;s most valuable player? Let&rsquo;s hypothesize!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NFL Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk says the MVP pick is &quot;already etched in stone.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s going to be Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, he said during a face-off with Michael Irvin on the <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-super-bowl/0ap2000000319415/M-M-Super-Bowl-XLVIII-MVP-prediction\"><u>NFL Network.</u></a> Faulk laid out pretty compelling evidence to make his case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Quarterbacks, they have won the MVP more than 50 percent of the time,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone on Twitter heard Faulk&rsquo;s claim and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mryangreen/status/428363003830865920\"><u>asked us if it is correct.</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turns out Faulk is right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the 47 Super Bowls, 26 quarterbacks have walked away with MVP honors, way more than any other position, according to an ESPN <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/superbowl/history/mvps\"><u>tally</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Victors include multiple winners such as Green Bay&rsquo;s Bart Starr, Pittsburgh&rsquo;s Terry Bradshaw, and San Francisco&rsquo;s Joe Montana, as well as recent repeat winners in New England&rsquo;s Tom Brady and the New York Giants&rsquo; Eli Manning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peyton Manning could join the two-time MVP club Sunday night. He won the award for <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=270204003\"><u>Super Bowl XLI</u></a> in 2007 after passing for 247 yards and a touchdown against the Chicago Bears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For his MVP pick, Irvin chose Broncos wide receiver Wes Welker. Wide receivers and running backs are the next most likely positions for MVP, but they far and away trail the quarterbacks. (It&rsquo;s a lot tougher for defense. The last defensive player to win the award was Tampa Bay Buccaneers safety Dexter Jackson in 2003.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Faulk&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-01-29T12:21:41.909626", "ruling_date": "2014-01-30T16:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Looking for a good bet?
