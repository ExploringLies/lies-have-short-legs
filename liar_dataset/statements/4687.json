The STAR Ohio fund &quot;just received the highest possible credit rating one of these funds can receive,&quot; he wrote in the Oct. 5 email.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandel went on to praise his staff for making tough decisions in the midst of an unpredictable economy. He also contrasted the fund&rsquo;s performance against the recent downgrade of the United States&rsquo; credit rating.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGiven his Senate candidacy and the consistent accusations he is an absent officeholder, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Mandel&rsquo;s claim about his performance as treasurer.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe treasurer&rsquo;s office directed us to its news release on Sept. 8. The release included a letter from the credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, along with recent news stories about local government investment funds. Like other credit rating agencies, S&amp;P analyzes the creditworthiness of various governments, government-backed funds and other investments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Aug. 23, S&amp;P sent a letter to the state affirming a AAAm rating for the STAR Ohio fund.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnfamiliar with the lower-case &quot;m&quot; attached to the rating, we looked it up under <a href=\"http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?assetID=1245303711350#ID578\">S&amp;P&rsquo;s ratings definitions</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe &quot;m&quot; subscript signifies a money market fund rating, which assesses the fund&rsquo;s ability to maintain a stable net asset value. AAAm is the highest of these ratings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Higher rated funds are expected to have stronger capacities to pay investor redemptions in cash during times of high market stress because they generally comprise shorter maturity and higher quality investments,&quot; according to S&amp;P.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMandel is accurate in saying the fund received the highest possible rating. He also told supporters the fund &quot;just&quot; received the rating, so we wanted to check whether the rating was upgraded under Mandel, or if the fund maintained a high rating established under previous treasurers. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJeff Sexton, a spokesman for S&amp;P, said STAR Ohio has received a AAAm rating since 1995, the first year S&amp;P rated the fund.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlthough Mandel has simply maintained the high rating, a public finance expert said the treasurer deserves some credit. The highest praise, however, should be reserved for the fund managers who maintained the rating during the financial crisis in 2008, said Kevin O&rsquo;Brien, executive director at the Center for Public Management in the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He deserves credit for maintaining that (rating) from January until now,&quot; said O&rsquo;Brien, a former financial analyst for Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service, another credit rating agency. &quot;They maintained the bond rating; they didn&#39;t achieve the bond rating.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked with Mandel&rsquo;s office to get an idea of how the STAR Ohio fund is managed. Spokesman Seth Unger said the office&rsquo;s investment department works with financial advisers to manage the fund. Unger said investments are bought and sold daily.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe STAR Ohio fund did, in fact, receive the highest rating possible, as Mandel&rsquo;s email claimed. But the rating already had been in place for 16 years. It did not improve under Mandel, as a reasonable person might assume from his email. And while he gets some credit for maintaining the rating, his email overstated the case. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose are important details that add context.
