Well, let me just give you a little slice of the loans, where we&#39;ve got particularly good data. The loans that were put out between 2007 and 2012 -- that cohort of loans -- is on target right now to produce $66 billion in profits for the United States government.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warren went on to say that the government has already spent the &quot;profits.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we&rsquo;ll see, there&rsquo;s an odd anomaly at work here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In making the $66 billion profit claim, Warren relies on one gold-standard source -- the federal Government Accountability Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But another gold-standard source -- the Congressional Budget Office -- says the accounting method used to produce that figure is flawed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, when the CBO has employed both the official method (which was mandated by Congress) and its own preferred accounting method, any projection of &quot;profit&quot; for the government from student loans turns into a loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s because CBO&rsquo;s preferred method of projecting takes into account more of the risks assumed by the government, such as defaults during hard economic times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How student loans work</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help students attend college, as a 2012 PolitiFact item <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/may/14/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-student-loan-money-was-used-cover/\">reported</a>, the federal government in 1965 took three important steps: Guaranteeing student loans against default; promising a certain interest rate to the banks (even if the rates students paid were lower); and paying additional fees to banks for administration and collection of student loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result: Millions of Americans earned college degrees. But the system required billions of dollars in federal subsidies and produced lucrative revenue streams for banks. Some in Washington, especially Democrats, sought alternatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2010, a law essentially eliminated the middle man -- the banks. The federal subsidies to the banks were replaced with direct loans administered by the Department of Education and funded through the U.S. Treasury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Huffington Post has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/14/student-loan-profits_n_5149653.html\">reported</a> that the government is forecast to generate billions in profits from making student loans. And Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump has said the government has turned student lending into a <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/finance/248913-trump-why-is-federal-government-making-money-on-student-loans\">&quot;profit center.&quot;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not so clear cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Warren&#39;s evidence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To back Warren&#39;s claim, her Senate office referred us to a January 2014 <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/660548.pdf\">report </a>from the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress that examines matters relating to the receipt and payment of public funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It estimated that the $454 billion in student loans the government disbursed from 2007 to 2012 will generate about $66 billion in &quot;subsidy income&quot; -- or what Warren calls profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Warren cites a figure from a respected source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as we said, the figure uses an accounting method that the Congressional Budget Office has called into question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other views</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post Fact Checker detailed some of this in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/elizabeth-warrens-claim-that-the-us-earns-51-billion-in-profits-on-student-loans/2013/07/10/7769a3c2-e9b8-11e2-aa9f-c03a72e2d342_blog.html\">examining</a> a similar claim, when Warren said the federal government made $51 billion from student loans just in 2013. Her statement earned <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/about-the-fact-checker/#pinocchio\">two Pinocchios</a> -- the Post&rsquo;s rating for a statement that contains significant omissions or exaggerations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As The Fact Checker noted, that projection was made using the mandated accounting method, which potentially underestimates the cost of the loans to the American taxpayer. The Congressional Budget Office&rsquo;s preferred accounting method -- known as fair value -- essentially assesses the risk as private firms would if they made the same types of loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that the CBO has pointed out the shortcomings of mandated method. In fact, it <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/43035\">has argued</a> for using fair value, saying it <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/113th-congress-2013-2014/reports/45383-FairValue.pdf\">better takes into account</a> the risks of lending to students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Some organizations, such as the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, have <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org//sites/default/files/atoms/files/6-18-13bud.pdf\">argued</a> that fair value makes federal credit programs such as student loans appear more expensive than their actual cost to the government.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is quite a difference, depending on which accounting method is used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a May 2014 <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/113th-congress-2013-2014/reports/45383-FairValue.pdf\">report</a>, the Congressional Budget Office did student loan projections for 2015 through 2024. During that 10-year period, using the official accounting method that Warren relied on in making her claim, the loans are expected to generate a &quot;profit&quot; of $135 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But using the &quot;fair value&quot; accounting method CBO <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/43035\">prefers</a>, the projection is an $88 billion loss to the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a swing of $223 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warren said student loans issued by the federal government between 2007 and 2012 are on target &quot;to produce $66 billion in profits&quot; for the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warren accurately cites an estimate from a Government Accountability Office report -- but that estimate was made with an accounting method that the Congressional Budget Office says is misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the CBO has pointed out in another report, using that accounting method, student loans are projected to generate $135 billion in &quot;profit&quot; from 2015 to 2024 -- but using the CBO&rsquo;s preferred accounting method, they are projected to produce an $88 billion loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em><strong>More on student loans</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russ Feingold says U.S. Senate opponent Ron Johnson &quot;is opposed to all government-assisted student loans.&quot;
