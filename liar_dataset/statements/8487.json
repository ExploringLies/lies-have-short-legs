Bill Young&rsquo;s death, the Republican Party of Florida<strong> </strong>started a full-court press attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Florida GOP posted a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u8kp2Nlk10&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><u>YouTube video</u></a> criticizing Sink on a host of issues, presumably attacks they pulled from their arsenal when she ran against Rick Scott for governor in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As Florida&rsquo;s CFO, Alex Sink failed Florida taxpayers by using the state plane as her own personal charter, overseeing a $27 billion loss in the state&rsquo;s pension fund and supporting a $5.2 billion increase in Florida&rsquo;s debt,&quot; the video&rsquo;s text reads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll examine other claims from the ad<strong> </strong>during the race, but in this fact-check we&rsquo;ll focus on looking into Sink&rsquo;s tie to the state pension fund. Is it accurate to say she oversaw $27 billion in losses?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the state&rsquo;s chief financial officer, Sink&rsquo;s responsibilities included accounting, auditing and managing Florida&rsquo;s finances. She also served on the State Board Administration of Florida, the office that oversees the pension fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their <a href=\"http://www.sbafla.com/fsb/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=e2VpU6DNe8c%3d&amp;tabid=1450&amp;mid=3976\"><u>Feburary 2013 report</u></a>, the SBA put the value of pension assets at $132 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007, the year Sink took office, the pension was worth <a href=\"http://www.sbafla.com/fsb/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=_lYsJ9rw0ek%3d&amp;tabid=1479&amp;mid=4108\"><u>$136.3 billion</u></a>,<strong> </strong>according to the SBA. In 2010, her last year as CFO, that value was down to <a href=\"http://www.sbafla.com/fsb/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=1KGUzNfF0IQ%3d&amp;tabid=1479&amp;mid=4108\"><u>$109.3 billion</u></a>. That makes the net loss $27 billion, as the ad said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This claim echoes those made by the party when Sink ran for governor against Republican Rick Scott. As we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/sep/23/republican-party-florida/gop-says-alex-sink-gave-bonuses-state-pension-work/\"><u>noted before</u></a>, there are several important caveats to this claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The action of comparing how much the pension is worth at different points in history is not as devastating as it might sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no permanent loss in value until the assets are sold. Although the pension was temporarily worth less in 2010 than in 2007, the money isn&rsquo;t gone by any means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the nation started recovering from the recession a couple of years ago, the Florida pension followed suit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The pension fund is in pretty good shape right now,&quot; said Kurt Wenner, vice president for tax research at Florida TaxWatch, a business-backed institute focused on tax issues. &quot;It certainly wasn&rsquo;t a critical situation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the figures not being permanent, the implication that Sink, as CFO, is to blame for the loss in value is also misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three SBA trustees jointly oversee the pension fund: the governor, the attorney general and the CFO. There&rsquo;s nothing that suggests Sink&rsquo;s responsibilities should be singled out above those of either former Gov. Charlie Crist &nbsp;or former Attorney General Bill McCollum (who were both Republicans at the time, by the way).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Republican Party of Florida said<strong> </strong>there was a loss of pension assets of $27 billion during Sink&rsquo;s term as the state&rsquo;s<strong> </strong>CFO. But that doesn&rsquo;t represent a permanent loss of funds. We also see no reason why Sink deserves more of the blame than the other two trustees. And, Sink was CFO during a historic recession.<strong> </strong>Given these sizeable caveats, we rate the Florida GOP&rsquo;s claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-01T13:10:36.822371", "ruling_date": "2013-11-01T15:52:55", "ruling_headline": "Florida GOP says Alex Sink oversaw $27B loss in pension fund", "ruling_headline_slug": "florida-gop-says-alex-sink-oversaw-27b-loss-pensio", "ruling_link_text": "Recession also to blame", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email interview with David Bergstein, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman, Oct. 31, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Susan Hepworth, Florida GOP spokeswoman, Oct. 30, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republican Party of Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u8kp2Nlk10&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><u>Alex Sink&rsquo;s History of Failures</u></a>,&quot; Oct. 30, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president for tax research, Oct. 31, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/sep/23/republican-party-florida/gop-says-alex-sink-gave-bonuses-state-pension-work/\"><u>GOP Says Alex Sink Gave Bonuses to State Pension Workers Who Lost Billions</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 23, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/oct/06/republican-party-florida/republican-party-florida-says-alex-sink-was-charge/\"><u>Republican Party of Florida Says Alex Sink Was In Charge of Pension Losses</u></a>,&quot; Oct. 6, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.sbafla.com/fsb/\"><u>About the SBA</u></a>,&quot; accessed Oct. 30, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.sbafla.com/fsb/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=e2VpU6DNe8c%3d&amp;tabid=1450&amp;mid=3976\"><u>Monthly Report to the Trustees</u></a>,&quot; April 1, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.sbafla.com/fsb/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=_lYsJ9rw0ek%3d&amp;tabid=1479&amp;mid=4108\"><u>State Board of Administration Investment Report 2006-07</u></a>,&quot; Nov. 30, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA Florida, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.sbafla.com/fsb/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=1KGUzNfF0IQ%3d&amp;tabid=1479&amp;mid=4108\"><u>State Board of Administration Investment Report 2010</u></a>,&quot; Nov. 1, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/alex-sink-announcement/2149702\"><u>Alex Sink is Running for C.W.
