Duncan Hunter said the detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are being coddled. Here&#39;s his full quote:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Those guys get taxpayer-paid-for prayer rugs. They have prayer five times a day. They&#39;ve all gained weight. The last time I looked at the menu, they had honey-glazed chicken and rice pilaf on Friday.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hunter accurately described the treatment of the detainees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the Joint Task Force Guantanamo, which runs the camp, provides prayer rugs to the detainees that are paid for by taxpayers, according to Lt. Col. Edward Bush, a spokesman for the task force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Detainees are given the opportunity to practice their religions,&quot; Bush said, which means that the Muslim call to prayer is sounded five times a day and played over the loudspeakers in the camp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush said the detainees are served three meals a day that meet their &quot;cultural dietary requirements,&quot; and chicken and rice pilaf is one of the offerings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He could not confirm that the chicken dish was served on a Friday, as Hunter specifically claimed, but Hunter&#39;s point remains valid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush said that while it&#39;s not possible to know if &quot;all&quot; of them gain weight, it is common for them to do so, he said.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:38.012265", "ruling_date": "2007-09-10T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Yes, chicken and rice on the menu", "ruling_headline_slug": "yes-chicken-and-rice-on-the-menu", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, chicken and rice on the menu", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview with Lt.
