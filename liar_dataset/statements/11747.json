That&rsquo;s a record for uninterrupted job growth, according to our friends at the <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/09/15/obamas-claim-that-businesses-are-in-the-longest-uninterrupted-stretch-of-job-creation/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Fact Checker</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This graph from BLS shows monthly change in private-sector job growth (in thousands) since the start of 2010:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VdapGg_-HtYoUjKheT9YGT8X8n-Xuo7nrG8LylnJP43Sxq4PtPVRCwSb0qQGDK0X1okZ2QSSBMBqE1nALgZ0kFdPQlfGHR3f74QPNj2T2Ui2wtb3X0JNOzwA6q8C4UNikOvVY-S7\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:256px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:498px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From early 2010 on, the data is above the zero line, showing positive job growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that the country has gained jobs despite the health care law also might not assuage critics&rsquo; argument that job growth, and other aspects of the economy, would have been stronger absent the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/23/andy-puzder/ceo-carls-jr-says-obamacare-has-caused-millions-fu/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>January 2015 fact-check</u></a>, we found that the law might have caused many thousands of employees to have their hours cut from full-time to part-time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But independent studies haven&rsquo;t backed up claims that the law would end up reducing employment. In 2011, we rated a claim from former Rep.
