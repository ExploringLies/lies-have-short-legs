Judy Manning, a Republican from Marietta, recently told The Marietta Daily Journal that she thinks the former Massachusetts governor is a flip-flopper and she is supporting Newt Gingrich, the former Georgia congressman who was speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. We thought one of her comments deserved a spin on the Truth-O-Meter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;When he was the governor of Massachusetts, he performed 100 &mdash; and I&rsquo;m not sure this number is right, but my mind says it&rsquo;s about 180 gay marriages &mdash; and now, when he is running as president on the Republican ticket, he says that marriage is between a man and a woman,&quot; Manning said in the article.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid Romney actually perform 100 to 180 gay marriages? Didn&rsquo;t Romney say in a nationally televised debate earlier this month that while he believes gay couples should have basic legal rights, one right they should not enjoy is marriage?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were curious to find out if Manning was right, particularly since she wasn&rsquo;t sure about how many marriages Romney may have performed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg denied the claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That is simply and completely untrue,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called Manning at her legislative office and at her home and sent the representative an email over the span of a week and did not get a reply.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney was elected governor in 2002 and served from 2003 to 2007. In 2003, the Massachusetts State Judicial Court ruled that same-sex couples have the legal right to marry.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMassachusetts has an obscure law that allows family members or friends to perform marriage ceremonies under a one-day marriage designation. The law includes same-sex couples.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2006, The Boston Globe reported that Romney approved 189 special-issue, one-day marriage designations to same-sex couples in 2005. The article was a look into Romney&rsquo;s approach on gay marriage as he considered a 2008 presidential run (which he later lost in the GOP primary). A Romney spokesman said in that article that he was bound by the law and had to approve those one-day marriage designations, although he opposed gay marriage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMaggie Gallagher, founder of the National Organization for Marriage, wrote a column in December praising Romney&rsquo;s support for a federal marriage amendment and his efforts to fight against gay marriage in Massachusetts. The National Organization for Marriage has fought against same-sex marriage on the national and local level.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney &quot;apparently approved many more, both before and after 2005, but we have not been able to get any records on them,&quot; Steve Baldwin, former executive director of the Council for National Policy, said in a column that appeared in the National Review late last month. &quot;There have been Freedom of Information Act requests to get more documents about this whole issue, but the state government has not been forthcoming.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMassachusetts officials said their records of one-day marriage designations date back to 2006, not 2005, the year The Boston Globe examined. Massachusetts officials say they do not keep track of how many one-day marriage designations are approved annually for same-sex couples.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMassEquality, a Boston-based group organized to preserve same-sex marriage equality, said Romney has not been supportive of gay marriage, and the group seriously doubted that he performed any ceremonies as governor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The notion that Mitt Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, presided over the weddings of same-sex couples is ridiculous,&quot; Executive Director Kara Suffredini told us via email. &quot;To the contrary -- and contrary to the promises he made while campaigning for governor -- he did everything he could to position himself as the face of the anti-marriage movement, going so far as to revive an arcane and racist anti-miscegenation law to block out-of-state same-sex couples from marrying in Massachusetts. Make no mistake, former Gov. Romney was no friend to loving same-sex couples and the thousands of children they are raising in Massachusetts.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s no evidence that Romney has performed any gay marriage ceremonies. It appears Rep. Manning used the wrong language to describe Romney&rsquo;s actions as governor because her estimate of how many marriages she thought he performed is very similar to the number of one-day marriage designations that The Boston Globe reported.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHad Manning said Romney approved 100 to 180 one-day marriage designations, her statement would likely be correct. However, she used the word &quot;performed,&quot; which suggests Romney actually officiated the ceremony and created a vastly different impression of the candidate&rsquo;s stance on same-sex marriage for anyone who read that article.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur rating: Pants On Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-17T16:14:45.592455", "ruling_date": "2012-01-18T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Lawmaker says Romney performed same-sex marriages as governor", "ruling_headline_slug": "lawmaker-says-romney-performed-same-sex-marriages-", "ruling_link_text": "No wedded bliss for this claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Marietta Daily Journal, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.mdjonline.com/view/full_story/16978337/article-Lawmakers-sound-off-on-\">Lawmakers sound off on &lsquo;12 hopefuls</a>,&quot; Jan. 4, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoston Globe, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2003/11/18/sjc_gay_marriage_legal_in_mass/\">SJC</a><a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2003/11/18/sjc_gay_marriage_legal_in_mass/\">: Gay marriage legal in Mass.</a>,&quot; Nov. 18, 2003<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail from MassEquality Executive Director Kara Suffredini, Jan. 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail from Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg, Jan. 10, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMarriage Equality New York, &quot;<a href=\"http://blog.marriageequalityny.org/2006/01/conflict-for-romney-on-gay-marriage.html\">Conflict for Romney on gay marriage</a>,&quot; Jan. 2, 2006<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMassachusetts one-day marriage designation instructions and <a href=\"http://www.mass.gov/governor/administration/legal/marriage/\">frequently asked questions</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Review, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/286813/mitt-and-gay-marriage-deroy-murdock?pg=2\">Mitt and Gay Marriage</a>,&quot; Dec. 30, 2011</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "State Representative", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Judy", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 1645, "last_name": "Manning", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "judy-manning", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Judy_Manning.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1645/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;When [Mitt Romney] was the governor of Massachusetts, he performed 100 &mdash; and I&rsquo;m not sure this number is right, but my mind says it&rsquo;s about 180 gay marriages.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview", "statement_date": "2012-01-04", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 118, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/118/", "subject": "Gays and Lesbians", "subject_slug": "gays-and-lesbians", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 134, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/134/", "subject": "Marriage", "subject_slug": "marriage", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 34, "current_job": "Former governor", "false_count": 32, "first_name": "Mitt", "half_true_count": 58, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 5, "last_name": "Romney", "mostly_true_count": 33, "name_slug": "mitt-romney", "pants_count": 19, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-mittromney.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/5/", "total_count": 221, "true_count": 30, "website": "http://www.mittromney.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
