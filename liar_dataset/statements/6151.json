The group asked people to call and write Alexander to make him switch his stance and vote for a resolution by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, to disapprove the EPA&#39;s new <a href=\"http://epa.gov/mats/basic.html\">Mercury and Air Toxics Standards</a> (MATS) for power plants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2012/jun/13/us-sen-lamar-alexander-says-hes-not-anti-coal-hes/\">Alexander responded</a> by saying he was &quot;standing up for Tennessee.&quot; He cited the pollution created from &quot;dirty air&quot; blowing into Tennessee from other states causing smog in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and even pointed out that more Tennesseans work for companies that make pollution-control equipment required under the rule than work mining coal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt a Congressional field hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reforms Committee in Murfreesboro, <a href=\"http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/6-18-12-Field-Alexander.pdf\">Alexander also claimed</a> that one result of &nbsp;&quot;dirty air&quot; is that, in Tennessee, &quot;three of our cities are among the top five worst cities in the U.S. for asthma.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe decided to see if that was indeed true.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA quick <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/asthma/DS00021\">primer on asthma</a> from the Mayo Clinic: It is &quot;a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Mayo Clinic says, &quot;It isn&#39;t clear why some people get asthma and others don&#39;t, but it&#39;s probably due to a combination of environmental and genetic (inherited) factors.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlexander&rsquo;s office said he was referring to the <a href=\"http://www.asthmacapitals.com/\">2012 Asthma Capitals</a> <a href=\"http://www.aafa.org/pdfs/2012_AC_FinalPublicList1.pdf\">rankings</a> released in May by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA).

The report also notes that air pollution is not the only factor it considers, with a total of 12 data sets that include the number of high-ozone days, pollen counts, medication utilization, poverty rates and public smoking laws.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlexander wasn&rsquo;t saying dirty air was the only reason Tennessee cities rank high on a list showing the most challenging cities in the country for asthma, just that the nation&rsquo;s 17th-largest state placed three of its cities in the top five of those rankings.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate that statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-23T08:31:54.704179", "ruling_date": "2012-06-24T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Lamar Alexander says three Tennessee cities among worst five in nation for asthma", "ruling_headline_slug": "lamar-alexander-says-three-tennessee-cities-among-", "ruling_link_text": "Something in the air?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tSen.
