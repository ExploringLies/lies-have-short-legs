Scott Walker is working to dampen liberals&rsquo; enthusiasm for his main Democratic rival in the November 2014 &nbsp;election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s part of his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhTUWgOk3mI&amp;list=UUEeJwPqSAkPNxIR-HZ89fvw\">second campaign TV ad </a>&nbsp;hitting Mary Burke&rsquo;s former employer, Wisconsin&rsquo;s Trek Bicycles, for building products overseas:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mary Burke is trying to sell us on her experience at her family business, but she forgot to mention they make 99% of their bikes overseas, in places like China, where her company has outsourced jobs for years,&quot; a narrator says. The spot adds that &quot;Burke&rsquo;s company &nbsp;makes almost all their bikes overseas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her campaign, Burke has highlighted her former role as a manager at Trek, the company founded in 1976 by her father, Richard, in Waterloo. She <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/writers/jack_craver/mary-burke-responds-to-criticism-over-outsourcing/article_1c7f94c4-4293-11e3-9792-0019bb2963f4.html\">has said</a> that Trek, as a company trying to compete globally, does what it can to manufacture bikes in the United States and makes more bikes in America than any other manufacturer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest Walker ad cites an OnMilwaukee.com piece from Jan. 9, 2011, flashing what looks like a headline that reads: &quot;Over 99.5% Of The Bicycles That Burke&rsquo;s Company Produces, Are Made Overseas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ll start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://onmilwaukee.com/market/articles/trekwisco.html\">piece</a>, a question-and-answer feature with a Trek spokesman, does not mention either Mary Burke or a figure of more than 99.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It ran under the headline &quot;Trek Corporation Committed To Wisconsin&quot; and highlighted Trek&rsquo;s employment of nearly 1,000 people in the state at three facilities and another 800 around the world at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story does not call Trek Mary Burke&rsquo;s company, as Walker&rsquo;s ad characterizes it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one of her own <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCEWRq5gJXM\">campaign videos,</a> Burke calls Trek &quot;my family&rsquo;s business&quot; and one she says she helped grow into a worldwide force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Burke left Trek&rsquo;s employment in 2004, and its board in &nbsp;2005, though she still owns stock in the private company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the Walker ad seemingly is off to a rough start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that OnMilwaukee piece did contain two numbers that allow a reader get a feeling for the balance of overseas versus domestic production at Trek, at least as of 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the piece, Trek official Eric Bjorling is quoted as saying that Trek makes roughly 10,000 bikes a year in Wisconsin. Later in the story, in response to a separate question, he said that Trek sells about 1.5 million bikes a year around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that Bjorling characterized the 10,000 figure as a rough estimate, saying it&rsquo;s &quot;almost impossible to give a number&quot; because production is seasonal and demand-based.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, doing the math yields an answer of 99.33 percent built overseas. So that works in Walker&rsquo;s favor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Trek company spokeswoman Marina Marich to comment on the ad and the number it presents, and she responded in part, &quot;As a privately held company, Trek doesn&rsquo;t disclose specific production data.&quot; A Burke campaign spokesman simply referred us to Trek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Industry observers say that broadly speaking, the 99 percent figure makes sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The bottom line is there is no major bicycle production in the U.S.,&quot; said Marc Sani, writer and former publisher of Bicycle Retailer &amp; Industry News. &quot;It left when Schwinn went to China in the 1980s. That was the beginning of the end.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trek and other U.S.-based bicycle companies have little or no choice but to build product in cheaper venues overseas in order to compete globally, Sani said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trek has two manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin -- one in Waterloo and one in Whitewater. Overseas, it builds in Germany, Holland and China. In 2011, CEO John Burke said Trek&rsquo;s sales were more than $800 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trek contends, without providing numbers to back it up, that it manufactures more bikes the United States than any other bicycle company and is the only &quot;major&quot; bicycle company that stills manufactures product in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2014/jan/08/mary-burkes-50-million-question/\">PolitiFact Wisconsin reported in January,</a> Burke and Trek also have declined to document her claim that &nbsp;while at Trek the European division she oversaw went from $3 million to over $50 million in sales.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jay Townley, a bicycle industry consultant based in Wisconsin, noted that because U.S. production is so low, the numbers are volatile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even if it was 30,000 instead of 10,000, the overseas production share would be 98 percent, which still sounds a lot like the Walker ad&rsquo;s phrasing that &quot;almost all&quot; of Trek&rsquo;s bikes are made outside the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walkers&rsquo; ad says that Trek Bicycle &quot;makes 99% of their bikes overseas,&quot; and it puts Mary Burke at the center of responsibility by saying Trek is &quot;Burke&rsquo;s company.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best available numbers, from Trek&rsquo;s own mouth, lend credence to the 99 percent claim, as do the best educated guesses by industry analysts. So the ad&rsquo;s main thrust is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calling Trek &quot;Burke&rsquo;s company&quot; is somewhat problematic, though. She held a management position there and still owns stock, but she left a decade ago and seven years before the 2011 story that yielded the 99 percent figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-07-25T14:44:56.147812", "ruling_date": "2014-07-28T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker says Trek makes 99% of its bicycles overseas", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-says-trek-makes-99-its-bicycles-overs", "ruling_link_text": "China, Holland, Germany", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Friends of Scott Walker, campaign TV ad,<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhTUWgOk3mI\"> &quot;Not So Much,</a>&quot;July 22, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Marc Sani, Bicycle Retailer and Industry News, July 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Jay Townley, Gluskin Townley Group LLC, July 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Marina Marich, spokeswoman, Trek Bicycles, July 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/burke-responds-to-walker-trek-ad-with-one-of-her-own-b99313751z1-267667691.html\">&quot;Burke, Walker trade charges over Trek&rsquo;s outsourcing of jobs,&quot;</a> July 18, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 38, "current_job": "Milwaukee County Executive", "false_count": 42, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 38, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 640, "last_name": "Walker", "mostly_true_count": 44, "name_slug": "scott-walker", "pants_count": 11, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Scott_Walker_1_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/640/", "total_count": 211, "true_count": 25, "website": "http://www.scottwalker.org/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;(Mary) Burke&rsquo;s company,&quot; Trek Bicycles, &quot;makes 99% of their bikes overseas.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign TV ad", "statement_date": "2014-07-22", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 192, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/192/", "subject": "Labor", "subject_slug": "labor", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 103, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/103/", "subject": "Workers", "subject_slug": "workers", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "Madison school board member", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Mary", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 2452, "last_name": "Burke", "mostly_true_count": 8, "name_slug": "mary-burke", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Mary_Burke_PFACT.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2452/", "total_count": 34, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://burkeforwisconsin.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
