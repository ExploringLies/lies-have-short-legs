Charles  Schumer, D-N.Y., said he doesn't expect a Republican filibuster. What Republican  and Democrats alike want is \"somebody who will follow the law, not make the  law,\" Schumer said, and he pointed to the pick of Judge Sonia Sotomayor as  evidence that Obama would choose someone \"in the mainstream.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"If you look at who  President Obama has nominated, somebody like Judge Sotomayor, who got nine  Republicans to vote for her, no one questioned that she was out of the  mainstream,\" Schumer said. \"The other nominees in many of the courts of appeals  and district courts, he chooses people in the mainstream. So I don't think  there's going to be a filibuster or a blocking.\"</p>\r\n<p>We are checking the  claim that \"no one questioned that she (Sotomayor) was out of the  mainstream.\"</p>\r\n<p>We  recalled that phrase came up a lot during the Sotomayor confirmation debate, so  we did some checking.</p>\r\n<p>To start, we direct your attention to a July 13,  2009, AP story under the headline, \"Sessions: Sonia Sotomayor 'out of  mainstream.'\"</p>\r\n<p>That's Sessions as in Sen. Jeff Sessions, the leading  Judiciary Committee Republican. The AP wrote that just hours before Sotomayor's  initial confirmation hearing, Sessions charged that Sotomayor is \"out of the  mainstream\" of legal thinking and has a very activist judicial profile.</p>\r\n<p>Sessions criticized  Sotomayor's much-discussed comment from a speech in 2001, that she hoped a \"wise  Latina\" often would reach better conclusions than a white male without the same  life experience.</p>\r\n<p>\"She has criticized the idea that a woman and a man  would reach the same result. She expects them to reach different results. I  think that's philosophically incompatible with the American system,\" Sessions  said on CBS's <em>Face the Nation</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Sessions was among 31 Republican senators who voted  against Sotomayor's confirmation, though Sessions said afterward that he was  glad that during the hearings Sotomayor rejected the \"empathy standard\" Obama  referred to when he nominated her.</p>\r\n<p>And Sessions wasn't the only Republican to invoke the  \"out of the mainstream\" claim:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; In a press release issued Aug. 5, 2009, Sen. Roger  Wicker, R-Miss., took issue with Sotomayor's ruling in a gun case, saying, it  \"shows an alarming hostility to law-abiding gun owners across the country. That  is a view that is certainly out of the mainstream in this nation.\"</p>\r\n<p>&bull; In a press release  issued Aug. 6, 2009, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said that at her confirmation  hearing Sotomayor attempted to distance herself from several statements \"and  explain them away, most likely recognizing that they were controversial and out  of the mainstream. However, in my mind, she was not very successful.\"</p>\r\n<p>&bull; In a statement  released on Aug. 4, 2009, Grassley said Sotomayor \"openly questioned  whether 'ignoring our differences as women, men, or even people of color...we do  a disservice both to the law and society.' This is yet another example of an out  of the mainstream judicial philosophy.\"</p>\r\n<p>&bull; A June 29, 2009, story in <em>Roll Call</em> noted that  talking points prepared for House and Senate Republicans urged members to make  the case that Sotomayor's written statements, rulings and speeches \"show an out  of the mainstream view of the role of a judge.\"</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Perhaps Schumer's  comment was one part hyperbole - that what he meant was \"hardly anyone\" claimed  Sotomayor was out of the mainstream. But we're sticklers for words, and  Schumer's absolute claim that \"no one questioned that she was out of the  mainstream\" isn't accurate. We understand that \"out of the mainstream\" is a  subjective term, but the fact is that a number of Republican senators used that  exact phrase. We rule Schumer's statement False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-04-13T11:59:10.541527", "ruling_date": "2010-04-13T12:19:17", "ruling_headline": "Schumer claims no one questioned that Sotomayor was out of the mainstream", "ruling_headline_slug": "schumer-claims-no-one-questioned-sotomayor-was-out", "ruling_link_text": "Except for those times when they called her \"out of the mainstream\"", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC News, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-secretaries-gates-clinton/story?id=10343909\" target=\"_blank\">Transcript of \"This Week,\"</a> April 11, 2010</p>\r\n<p>AP, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D99DHHT86&amp;show_article=1\" target=\"_blank\">\"Sessions: Sonia Sotomayor 'out of mainstream'\"</a> by Mark Sherman, July 13, 2009</p>\r\n<p>Web site of Chuck Grassley, Press release: <a href=\"http://grassley.senate.gov/news/Article.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1502=22295\" target=\"_blank\">\"Nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court,\"</a> Aug. 4, 2009</p>\r\n<p>Web site of Chuck Grassley, Press release: <a href=\"http://grassley.senate.gov/news/Article.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1502=22365\" target=\"_blank\">\"Grassley Casts &ldquo;No&rdquo; Vote in Opposition to Sotomayor nomination,\"</a> Aug. 6, 2009</p>\r\n<p>Web site of Sen.
