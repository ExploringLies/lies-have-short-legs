Chris Christie said he vowed to the people of New Jersey that he would not raise their taxes and that&rsquo;s the only oath that matters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut his allegiance to that pledge falls into murky territory.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I haven&#39;t raised taxes in the time I&#39;ve been the governor of New Jersey and I didn&#39;t need to sign a pledge not to,&quot; Christie said at an Aug. 20 news conference in Asbury Park when asked about an anti-tax oath signed by many Republicans. &quot;I made a pledge to the people of the state not to. I don&#39;t need to make a pledge to anybody else.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith Christie expected to flaunt his New Jersey credentials in the keynote address at the Republican National Convention next week, PolitiFact New Jersey wondered whether his tax claim is accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRates for the state&rsquo;s three biggest revenue generators -- income, sales and corporation business taxes -- have not gone up under Christie.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the governor has cut funding for tax credit programs and several experts said those reductions are, in effect, tax increases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;For practical purposes decreasing tax credits is the same as a tax increase. The person&#39;s effective tax rate goes up,&quot; David Brunori, a research professor of public policy at The George Washington University, said in an e-mail. &quot;Still, most people think of tax increases as rate hikes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo rates haven&rsquo;t increased, but some homeowners and certain low-income individuals are receiving less money to offset their tax bills.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey scaled back the state&rsquo;s earned income tax credit -- which the state Treasury Department website says &quot;reduces the amount of New Jersey tax you owe and may also give you a refund, even if you have no tax liability to New Jersey&quot; -- in Christie&rsquo;s first year in office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, Christie cut spending for two property tax relief programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBudget analyses from the state&rsquo;s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services shows homeowners who qualify for one of those programs, what is now called the Homestead Benefit program, received an average rebate of more than $1,000 in fiscal year 2010. Now, the average credit is less than half that amount. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState Treasury Department officials argued that these tax credit programs are payments from the state and so reductions in credits do not represent tax increases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBill Quinn, a Treasury Department spokesman, said &nbsp;&quot;the Earned Income Tax Credit in most cases really represents a subsidy payment to low income citizens,&quot; pointing out that more than 76 percent of earned income tax credit recipients in 2010 owed no New Jersey tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Dennis J. Ventry, Jr., a professor at University of California Davis School of Law, said that a reduction in a tax credit is &nbsp;&quot;absolutely a tax increase.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Tax credits reduce tax liability for eligible claimants. Thus, cutting, restricting, or repealing a tax credit for an otherwise eligible individual or business would -- absent other changes to the tax system such as a reduction in rates -- result in higher taxes owed,&quot; Ventry said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRichard Pomp, a professor of law at the University of Connecticut and state taxation expert said, &quot;why are we fighting the semantic issues? To someone who has had a benefit cut that is less money they have to spend,&quot; whether you call it a tax increase or a spending cut.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, Joseph Henchman, vice president of legal and state projects at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, said it&rsquo;d be a mistake to equate reductions in tax credits as tax increases or spending cuts. &quot;They have elements of both and are strictly neither,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie said, &quot;I haven&#39;t raised taxes in the time I&#39;ve been the governor of New Jersey.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe rates for the state&rsquo;s three major taxes have not increased during the governor&rsquo;s tenure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Christie reduced funding for several tax credit programs. The governor&rsquo;s administration argues those tax credits are spending programs, but several experts said reductions in tax credits amount to tax increases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this claim Half True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/08/chris_christie_taxes_1.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-08-22T14:23:00.959942", "ruling_date": "2012-08-23T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Christie says he hasn\u2019t raised taxes in New Jersey", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-christie-says-he-hasnt-raised-taxes-new-jers", "ruling_link_text": "For some, tax burden increased", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tAudio of Gov.
