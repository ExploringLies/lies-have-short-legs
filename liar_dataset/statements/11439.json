A Texas state representative suggested that Sanders must somehow then be aligned with the Nazis of Adolf Hitler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Rep. Jason Villalba, R-Dallas, posted a tweet during the CNN-hosted Democratic presidential debate Oct. 13, 2015, that opened: &quot;The modern Democrat Party is filled with Democratic Socialists and soft socialists. Is this where we are in America?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To that tweet, Villalba attached an image of what looked like an old document stating: &quot;That awkward moment when &hellip; 1) Bernie Sanders admits he is a Democratic Socialist. 2) Nazis were Democratic Socialists 3) America fought an entire World War to stop the advance of Democratic Socialists.&quot; The image closed: &quot;Sincerely, Sane Americans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Democratic activist, <a href=\"http://progresstexas.org/author/ed-espinoza\">Ed Espinoza </a>of Progress Texas, brought it to our attention for a fact check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t hear back from Villalba about the presented &quot;Democratic Socialist&quot; conclusions. But <a href=\"http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2015/10/under-fire-from-democrats-dallas-lawmaker-stands-by-tweet-with-nazi-meme.html/\">he told</a> the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> and Jonathan Tilove, chief political writer for the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em>, that the image with its mentions of Sanders and the Nazis was a meme he found online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also insisted his tweet wasn&rsquo;t likening Democrats to Nazis. &quot;So is the history accurate in this?&quot; Villalba <a href=\"http://politics.blog.statesman.com/2015/10/15/whats-in-a-meme-on-jason-villalba-likening-democratic-socialist-bernie-sanders-to-a-nazi/\">told Tilove by phone</a>. &quot;Of course not. Look, was I trying to make a connection between Sanders and the Nazi party? Absolutely not. I categorically reject any suggestion that that &nbsp;is what I was intending to do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the next day, Villalba&#39;s tweet was no longer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JasonVillalba\">posted by him</a>. Regardless, we checked its accuracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sanders a democratic socialist</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders, the independent Vermont senator running for the Democratic presidential nomination, considers himself a democratic socialist. He&rsquo;s also Jewish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2015/10/13/cnn-democratic-debate-full-transcript/\">In the debate</a>, moderator Anderson Cooper delved in:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:67.5pt\">COOPER: &quot;You call yourself a democratic socialist. How can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:67.5pt\">SANDERS: &quot;Well, we&#39;re going to win because first, we&#39;re going to explain what democratic socialism is. And what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent - almost - own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. That it is wrong, today, in a rigged economy, that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:67.5pt\">&quot;That when you look around the world, you see every other major country providing healthcare to all people as a right, except the United States. You see every other major country saying to moms that, when you have a baby, we&#39;re not going to separate you from your newborn baby, because we are going to have - we are going to have medical and family paid leave, like every other country on Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:67.5pt\">&quot;Those are some of the principles that I believe in and I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people&hellip;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:67.5pt\">COOPER: &hellip;&quot;You don&#39;t consider yourself a capitalist, though?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:67.5pt\">SANDERS: &quot;Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street&#39;s greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don&#39;t. I believe in a society where all people do well. Not just a handful of billionaires.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nazis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And were the Nazis also Democratic Socialists?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We consulted historians and books, finding the Nazi party&rsquo;s full name was the National Socialist German Workers&rsquo; Party. That name was adopted in 1920; before that, the party had been the German Workers&rsquo; Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there was little socialist about the party&rsquo;s platform or Hitler&rsquo;s actions once he acceded to leading Germany in the early 1930s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone and email, Rice University historian <a href=\"http://history.rice.edu/faculty/peter-c-caldwell\">Peter Caldwell</a> told us the key word in the party&rsquo;s name was &quot;national&quot; and the party&rsquo;s focus was on building nationalism &mdash; a focus ultimately reflected in Hitler&rsquo;s twisted vision of cleansing the country of residents, especially Jews, not considered of pure German blood. While socialists on the left celebrate democracy, Caldwell said, the word has a different meaning on the right &mdash; in this instance, he said, excluding people who are not part of the nation, hence rejecting Jews and communists and, in pre-World War II Germany, democracy itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caldwell said the &quot;misleading&quot; tweet suggesting an alignment between Sanders&rsquo; professed democratic socialism and Hitler&rsquo;s party would &quot;have Hitler turning in his grave, wherever the grave is. The Nazis loudly opposed democracy, the first and foremost thing.&quot; Also, he said, &quot;they were opposed to emancipating the workers, giving them the rights to vote and to organize&quot; in unions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"http://www.brynmawr.edu/cities/BLane.htm\">Barbara Miller Lane</a>, a Bryn Mawr College professor and co-editor of a compilation of Nazi ideology before 1933, said by email: &quot;The Nazis were NOT &lsquo;democratic socialists,&rsquo; whatever that means. The Nazis were never democrats and never real socialists either.&quot; While there was a longstanding and distinguished Social Democratic Party in Germany from the 1870 to the 1920s, Lane wrote, the Nazis fought against it, and after 1933 imprisoned its leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lane added: &quot;The Nazis opposed all traditional socialism, wanting to substitute something they called &lsquo;German socialism&rsquo; or &lsquo;Aryan socialism.&rsquo; This meant citizenship and privileges only for &lsquo;Aryans&rsquo; (meaning non-Jews), concentration camps for others.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cambridge.org/US/academic/subjects/history/regional-and-world-history-general-interest/cambridge-illustrated-history-germany\">The Cambridge Illustrated History of Germany,</a>&quot; Hitler joined the German Workers&rsquo; Party in 1919, the year before the party&rsquo;s decision to add National and Socialist to its name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, according to the book, supporters included &quot;well-placed anti-Semites and extreme nationalists&quot; who hoped to gain influence over members of the working class; Hitler, a spellbinding orator, became the party&rsquo;s chairman in 1921. Another book, <a href=\"http://www.infobasepublishing.com/Bookdetail.aspx?ISBN=0816081425\">&quot;A Brief History of Germany,&quot;</a> says the Nazi&rsquo;s &quot;appealed to a broad swath of the German population, attracting fervent nationalists and radical conservatives, as well as those who hated the Versailles settlement, feared the communists, or despised the Jews.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Villalba said Sanders &quot;admits he is a democratic socialist&hellip; Nazis were Democratic Socialists.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist. The Nazis were not democratic socialists. Whether or not Villalba intended to link Sanders to the Nazis, his tweet neatly did the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We find this claim historically inaccurate and ridiculous.
