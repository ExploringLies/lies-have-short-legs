He was fined $300,000 for ethics violations and took $1.6 million from Freddie Mac, before it helped cause the economic meltdown. Newt supports amnesty for illegal immigrants, and teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming. Maybe that&rsquo;s why George Will calls him the least conservative candidate. Check the facts at NewtFacts.com.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVXbiY33TdM&amp;feature=player_embedded\">ad</a>, airing in December 2011 in Florida and Iowa, is paid for by a political action committee, which isn&rsquo;t formally tied to any campaign but can spend money influencing elections. The one behind this ad is known as <a href=\"http://www.restoreourfuture.com/\">Restore our Future</a> and is <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/pro-mitt-romney-group-attacks-newt-gingrich-on-the-air-in-florida/1206644\">staffed and funded by many supporters of Mitt Romney</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt goes after the former House speaker on several issues. Here, we&rsquo;re focusing on the claim that Gingrich &quot;teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The source</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ad cites the website <a href=\"http://newtfacts.com/\">Newtfacts.com</a>, which lays out a list of -- you guessed it -- more claims and citations about Gingrich, including this one:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Gingrich shot an ad with Nancy Pelosi in 2008 calling for action on global warming,&quot; followed by a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaZFfQKWX54\">link</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn that now-famous ad, Gingrich sits on a couch next to Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the House.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We don&rsquo;t always see eye to eye, do we, Newt?&quot; Pelosi says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;No,&quot; Gingrich answers, &quot;but we do agree: Our country must take action to address climate change.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPelosi: &quot;We need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGingrich: &quot;If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ad then directs viewers to the website WeCanSolveIt.org, with the final words from Pelosi, &quot;Together, we can do this.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>About Al Gore</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ad was created by a Gore-founded organization called the Alliance for Climate Protection that aims to spread awareness and prompt action to address climate change. It&rsquo;s now known as the Climate Reality Project.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWeCanSolveIt.org is the former name of the site now called <a href=\"http://climaterealityproject.org/\">ClimateRealityProject.org</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It is guided by one simple truth: The climate crisis is real and we know how to solve it,&quot; the site says. The group claims 5 million members worldwide.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUXNodLskGM\">interview</a> with the online news show <em>The Young Turks</em> in December 2011, Gore mentioned that he had asked Gingrich to do the ad with Pelosi and Gingrich agreed. It was part of a larger campaign featuring &quot;&#39;unlikely pairs,&#39; who disagree on many issues but appear together to help thwart climate change,&quot; according to a 2008 story in the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>What they&rsquo;re saying now</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nGingrich, now tied for the lead for the Republican nomination, has big regrets that he made the ad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Gingrich campaign directed us to a section of its website devoted to &quot;<a href=\"http://www.newt.org/answers#GlobalWarming\">answering the attacks</a>.&quot; In the climate change section, Gingrich is quoted as telling Fox News&rsquo; Brett Baier that making the ad with Pelosi was &quot;probably the dumbest single thing I&rsquo;ve ever done.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt goes on to explain that Gingrich opposes cap and trade legislation (although PolitiFact has found he <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/07/newt-gingrich/gingrich-claims-he-never-favored-cap-and-trade/\">supported it</a> in the past), and he favors increased domestic oil drilling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the online news interview, Gore lamented Gingrich&rsquo;s change of heart.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I appreciated him agreeing to my request that he do it and I don&rsquo;t want to be ungracious now. I&rsquo;m grateful that he did it, and I&rsquo;m sorry that he&rsquo;s changed his position,&quot; Gore said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nRestore Our Future&rsquo;s ad says that Gingrich &quot;teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2008, Gingrich filmed an ad with Pelosi calling for action on global warming, and he did it for Gore&rsquo;s nonprofit group. Gingrich might regret it now, but the baggage is still there.
