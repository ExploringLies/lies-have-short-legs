Bill Nelson, with distorted claims about the health care law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis time, the group is called American Commitment. The ad claims to have &quot;the facts,&quot; but then trots out several distortions we&rsquo;ve already debunked.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Florida patients and seniors deserve to know what are the facts about President Barack Obama&rsquo;s health care law,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/another-outside-group-florida-tv-targeting-bill-nelson-health-care-vote\">the ad says</a>. &quot;Fact: Bill Nelson was the deciding vote. The bill could cost up to $2 trillion, double what we were promised. Nelson&rsquo;s health care vote imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class, cuts $500 billion from Medicare to pay for new government programs, and millions could lose their current coverage. Tell Bill Nelson: Protect Florida patients, repeal the health care law.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn <a href=\"http://www.americancommitment.org/about-us/\">its website</a>, American Commitment says it supports &quot;free markets, economic growth, Constitutionally-limited government, property rights, and individual freedom&quot; and advertises connections to other conservative groups like the Club for Growth and Americans for Prosperity. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a 501(c)4, so it doesn&rsquo;t have to disclose its donors. (For more details about American Commitment&rsquo;s connections and spending, check out <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/the-latest-gop-player-american-commitment/2012/07/10/gJQARbV4aW_blog.html\">this report</a> from the <em>Washington Post</em>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked American Commitment for evidence for its charges, but we didn&rsquo;t hear back.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere, we&rsquo;re going to look at whether Nelson was the deciding vote. We fact-checked this statement in June 2012 when another outside spending group <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/jun/14/60-plus-association/florida-bill-nelson-deciding-vote-health-care/\">made the same charge</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe&#39;ve also fact-checked the ad&#39;s statement that the law was the largest tax increase in history on the middle class. We rated that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/jul/11/american-commitment/health-care-law-largest-tax-increase-history-middl/\">Pants on Fire</a>. And, we&#39;ve previously looked at claims about cutting $500 billion from Medicare (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/may/15/us-chamber-commerce/chamber-says-bill-nelson-voted-cut-medicare-500-bi/\">Mostly False</a>) and millions losing coverage (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/29/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obamacare-means-20-million-americ/\">False</a>).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The 2009 health care vote</strong><br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s no doubt that the health care law was passed with several very close votes. <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00396\">One of the key votes</a> happened on Dec. 24, 2009, when 59 Democrats and one independent voted together in favor of the bill. (Sixty votes were needed for a preliminary cloture vote to prevent filibusters.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNelson was among the 60 senators who voted for the bill to go forward.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOpponents of the law have argued that any of those 60 cast the deciding vote, because every vote was needed to pass the bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe find that argument unpersuasive, because there&rsquo;s evidence in the record to show that some of those votes were more critical than others.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tAs we<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/26/national-republican-senatorial-committee/nrsc-attacks-michael-bennet-casting-deciding-vote-/\"> noted before</a>, there is a long history of senators holding back their votes until their demands are met. On the health care law, some senators did hold out until the last minute -- but Nelson wasn&rsquo;t one of them.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tOne of the detailed reports we&rsquo;ve seen on the final negotiations for the law is from the<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/24/nation/la-na-health-ticktock24-2009dec24\"> <em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>. According to its report, some of the most crucial votes came from Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.; Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb.; and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tAccording to the newspaper, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., &quot;knew that he had to keep Lieberman in the tent. And the next night, when Democrats gathered for a special caucus meeting, Reid did not call out the Connecticut senator, focusing instead on the need to unite and move forward.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tAt the meeting, Reid turned to Nelson of Nebraska, who also &quot;had a long list of demands, including more restrictions on funding abortions and full federal funding to expand Nebraska&#39;s Medicaid program. ... Reid was closing in on a deal.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tSuddenly, another roadblock appeared: Republican opponents of the bill threatened to filibuster -- that is, indefinitely block consideration of -- an unrelated defense appropriations bill as a way of indirectly delaying the health care measure. To get around that, Reid had to persuade Feingold -- an opponent of the defense bill for substantive reasons -- not to join the Republican blockade.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&quot;Reid was unwilling to challenge Feingold on a vote of conscience,&quot; the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported. &quot;And when Democrats gathered for yet another special caucus meeting ... Reid was ready to concede defeat. But as dejected senators began to leave, Feingold arose: He would put aside his convictions on the war, he said, and vote with his party. &#39;I don&#39;t think there was a dry eye in the caucus room,&#39; said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tThere was also a concern about whether Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., would physically be able to reach the chamber because he had been in the hospital with a staph infection. But he was brought in in a wheelchair and voted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found several other news articles that focused on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/health/policy/20health.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\">Nebraska&#39;s Nelson</a> as the final key for Senate Democrats in 2009. He announced his support days before the Christmas Eve vote, after he reached a compromise about abortion and federal funding for his state. But in March 2010 the Nebraska senator voted against the final<a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00105\"> bill</a>.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tThe Nebraska senator told<a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/12/20/cnn-exclusive-nelson-answers-his-critics-on-health-care-reform/\"> CNN</a> in December 2009: &quot;I couldn&rsquo;t create the opportunity to be the 60th vote. It happened. &hellip; If you think it&rsquo;s fun having both sides on an issue mad at you when you are trying to do something in good faith, just think it&rsquo;s like going home and getting bit by the family dog. So who enjoys that?&quot; Ben Nelson is retiring and not running for re-election.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Bill Nelson&rsquo;s role</strong><br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tIn the summer of 2009, Florida&rsquo;s Bill Nelson was quiet about health care reform -- angering some Democratic activists. But in September he jumped into the fray -- offering amendments about<a href=\"http://billnelson.senate.gov/news/details.cfm?id=318376&amp;\"> Medicare Advantage</a> and<a href=\"http://billnelson.senate.gov/news/details.cfm?id=318232&amp;\"> Medicare drug benefits</a>. Nelson sounded cautiously supportive in news accounts -- saying he had some criticisms but called the bill a &quot;starting point.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&quot;There are serious issues to be resolved,&quot; Nelson said in a<a href=\"http://billnelson.senate.gov/news/details.cfm?id=317849&amp;\"> speech</a> on the floor of the Senate in September 2009. &quot;This senator is optimistic, and I believe that we are going to be able to achieve this goal of expanding affordable health care to nearly all Americans.&quot;<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tIn October 2009, Nelson joined other Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee in voting for the health care plan. Nelson called the package a<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/sen-bill-nelson-votes-for-health-care-plan-blasts-industry-funded-study/1043811\"> &quot;good start.&quot;</a><br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tIn November during public stops in the Tampa Bay area, he predicted the Senate would pass a health care bill and said: &quot;If we don&#39;t do something about health care, it&#39;s going to run our country into bankruptcy.&quot; The <em>Orlando Sentinel </em>described him as an<a href=\"http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/dcblog/2009/11/florida_senators_split_on_heal_1.html\"> &quot;enthusiastic cheerleader for the emerging legislation.&quot;</a><br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tAfter the December vote, the health care bill still needed changes and another round of approvals. Nelson&rsquo;s office issued a<a href=\"http://billnelson.senate.gov/news/details.cfm?id=323387&amp;\"> press release</a> in March 2010 saying that despite the legislation&rsquo;s &quot;flaws&quot; -- including that it didn&rsquo;t force drug makers to reduce the costs of prescriptions -- he would support it.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&quot;Nelson, who had been considered by some to be a possible swing vote, made his declaration just at the outset of Senate starting its deliberations on changes to the health care signed into law by President Obama yesterday,&quot; stated Nelson&rsquo;s press release.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tWhen we fact-checked this claim previously, Nelson Senate spokesman Dan McLaughlin told PolitiFact Florida in an email: &quot;There&rsquo;s no way every Democratic senator could have cast the &lsquo;deciding vote.&rsquo; And there&rsquo;s no way to say Bill Nelson cast the deciding vote -- when he didn&rsquo;t. Nelson didn&rsquo;t like the bill. He tried to improve it. Among other things, he offered an amendment against the drug-makers. And, he announced his vote well before the roll call. He played no extraordinary role in the final passage.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\tAmerican Commitment says that Florida Sen. Bill Nelson cast the &quot;deciding vote&quot; for health care. The health care law required 60 votes, so Nelson&#39;s vote was crucial -- as were the other 59 votes. But describing Nelson as the &quot;deciding vote&quot; suggests he had some extraordinarily powerful role, and that&rsquo;s not the case. Nelson had cautiously been a supporter for months as he tried to amend the law.
