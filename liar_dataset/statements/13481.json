He would not mention his name unless he was condemning him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The record on the first part of Stewart&rsquo;s statement - that Gillespie would not appear with Trump - doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to a fact-check because it requires us to get into Gillespie&rsquo;s head. Gillespie never did appear on stage with Trump in Virginia, but there&rsquo;s no evidence he refused to do so. Gillespie&rsquo;s campaign says he was never invited by Trump&rsquo;s camp and we&rsquo;ve found no information to contradict that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we&rsquo;ll fact check the second part of Stewart&rsquo;s statement - that Gillespie only mentioned Trump&rsquo;s name when he was &quot;condemning him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we reached out to Stewart, he repeated that Gillespie kept Trump at an arm&rsquo;s length and &quot;never mentioned Trump&quot; in a positive light. Stewart said that early in the campaign, Gillespie simply made a generic vow to support the GOP nominee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only time Gillespie mentioned Trump by name, Stewart said, was to take the him to task following a release of a 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which Trump made vulgar comments about groping women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillespie did criticize Trump for that, <a href=\"http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/article_579f40a3-4c9e-5874-b6cf-18cf1105a567.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>calling</u></a> the candidate&rsquo;s comments &quot;incredibly offensive and demeaning.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But contrary to Stewart&rsquo;s statement, there were a few times when Gillespie did mention Trump&rsquo;s name - tepidly - while voicing support for the GOP ticket. Matt Moran, Gillespie&rsquo;s campaign spokesman, pointed out those occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;A May 4 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/gillespie-and-wittman-candidates-for-va-governor-say-they-will-support-trump/2016/05/04/84502ad4-1246-11e6-8967-7ac733c56f12_story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>article</u></a> in The Washington Post that noted Gillespie issued a one-sentence, prepared statement of support for Trump. The statement said, &quot;Republican voters have nominated Donald Trump for president, and I will vote for him against Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in an election that will not only affect control of the White House but the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation or more.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;A May podcast <a href=\"https://bearingdrift.com/2016/05/28/vpod-ed-gillespie-lets-grow-va/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview</u></a> with Bearing Drift, a conservative blog. Gillespie said, &quot;It&rsquo;s very important that we help Donald Trump carry the commonwealth against Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders because we play a critically important role in the Electoral College.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;An Aug. 23 <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7csCCq2zWivWkNoWU41bW1XQUk/view\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>interview</u></a> with the Loudoun Times that was recorded by Gillespie&rsquo;s campaign. &quot;I&rsquo;m voting for Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton,&quot; Gillespie said. &quot;That is our choice in this election. It&rsquo;s not just about the control of the executive branch for the next four years, but control of the judiciary for the next 30 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No doubt, Gillespie&rsquo;s actions on Trump will be an issue in next year&rsquo;s GOP primary for governor. Stewart isn&rsquo;t the only Trump supporter accusing Gillespie of shunning the president-elect this fall. John Fredericks, who served as chairman of Trump&rsquo;s campaign during the final month after Stewart was ousted, also said that Gillespie kept Trump at arm&rsquo;s length.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This was a cold, calculating political decision that he made that he&rsquo;ll have to live with now,&quot; John Fredericks said of Gillespie. Fredericks became chairman of Trump&rsquo;s Virginia campaign in October, after Stewart was fired for making unauthorized comments. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Fredericks also acknowledged that he never asked Gillespie to appear with Trump and, therefore, can&rsquo;t say definitively if Gillespie &quot;would not&quot; do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fredericks told us that that Gillespie did attend two rallies held by Trump&rsquo;s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. They were held in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-ri_yhDJn4\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Harrisonburg</u></a> on Oct. 5 and at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mike_pence/status/795076133347790848\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>George Mason University</u></a> on Nov. 5. At the latter event, Fredericks said he introduced Gillespie, who never mentioned Trump in his speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Gillespie is taking hits from Republicans for distancing himself from Trump, the state Democratic Party is trying to tie him to the president-elect. The Democrats started a &quot;Trump for Virginia governor&quot; <a href=\"http://www.trump4gov.com/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>website</u></a> that claims Gillespie, Stewart and other GOP gubernatorial candidates are &quot;YUUGE Trump supporters.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we should finally note that Stewart was fired as the Trump campaign&rsquo;s Virginia chairman on Oct.10 after joining a rally in front of the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington where he accused GOP &quot;establishment pukes&quot; of failing to sufficiently support Trump&rsquo;s campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stewart said Gillespie &quot;would not mention&quot; Trump&rsquo;s name &quot;unless he was condemning him.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillespie certainly did not praise Trump, and he did criticize the presidential nominee for making a vulgar statement about women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are several instances where Gillespie mentioned Trump while voicing support of the GOP ticket, saying it was important to keep conservative control of the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we rate Stewart&rsquo;s statement False.</p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cf171a22-e911-49e7-868b-1a84bf9498e4\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cf171a22-e911-49e7-868b-1a84bf9498e4</a> \r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-11-21T00:25:55.049405", "ruling_date": "2016-11-21T02:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Corey Stewart stretches Ed Gillespie's statements on Donald Trump", "ruling_headline_slug": "corey-stewart-stretches-ed-gillespies-statements", "ruling_link_text": "Gillespie said he'd vote for Trump", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Richmond Times-Dispatch, <a href=\"http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/article_9c02e6c9-bf20-5aa7-8f03-aa0da957b915.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Trump&rsquo;s Surprise shakes up Virginia governor&rsquo;s race&quot;</u></a> Nov. 9, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Corey Stewart, Nov. 10, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interviews with John Fredericks, co-chair of Donald Trump&rsquo;s presidential campaign in Virginia.
