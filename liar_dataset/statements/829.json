Guess what? It&#39;s phony.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe e-mail is a graphic ( <a href=\"http://static.politifact.com.s3.amazonaws.com/files/mobamamailer.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"> view it here </a> ) that has an accurate quote from Obama next to her photo: &quot;The truth is, in order get things like universal health care and a revamped education system, then someone is going to have to give up a piece of the pie so that someone else can have more.&quot; Obama made the remarks on the campaign trail in North Carolina on April 8, 2008.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe e-mail then says, &quot;Oh really? Who is the someone that gives up a piece of the pie? Keep the change!&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt then shows a receipt with the caption, &quot;Receipt signed by Michelle Obama at Waldorf Astoria on October 15, 2008 at 4:00 p.m., $447.39 for an afternoon snack.&quot; The receipt then lists things like whole steamed lobsters and &quot;Iranian Osetra caviar.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe receipt is a phony mock-up, and doesn&#39;t even look like the receipts the hotel actually uses, said a spokeswoman for the Waldorf Astoria hotel.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tObama was not staying at the hotel, and the story is &quot;completely made up,&quot; the spokeswoman said. Usually, the hotel doesn&#39;t comment at all on its guests, but was willing to deny the report in this case because it is false and &quot;it&#39;s escalated so much,&quot; the spokeswoman said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe basis for the e-mail appears to be a story that appeared Oct. 17, 2008, in the <em> New York Post </em> gossip column Page Six. The newspaper has since posted a correction: &quot;The source who told us last week about Michelle Obama getting lobster and caviar delivered to her room at the Waldorf-Astoria must have been under the influence of a mind-altering drug. She was not even staying at the Waldorf. We regret the mistake, and our former source is going to regret it, too.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe&#39;re not sure who created the e-mail, but it credits itself to PUMA PAC, a political action committee formed in the wake of Hillary Clinton&#39;s loss to Barack Obama in the Democratic Primary. PUMA says its acronym stands for &quot;People United Means Action,&quot; but among Democrats its common meaning is usually thought to be &quot;Party unity, my a--.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPUMA posted the graphic to its Web site a few days after the <em> New York Post </em> story appeared, but has since retracted it. PUMA PACs&#39;s executive director, Darragh Murphy, posted a message to the group&#39;s Web site that states, &quot;I sincerely regret repeating and amplifying what turns out to be a shameful attempt to embarrass and undermine Michelle Obama. I will take better care in checking sources in the future.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo the hotel where the event was supposed to have occurred repudiates the e-mail, the newspaper that originally reported it repudiates the e-mail, and the political group that promoted it repudiates the e-mail.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLest we be in the grips of a well-oiled conspiracy, we went back and checked on Michelle Obama&#39;s activities on the day in question. The date and time on the receipt are Oct. 15, 2008, at 16:04, or 4:04 p.m. That day, Obama was in Fort Wayne, Ind., speaking at a rally, and was onstage speaking at about 1:30 p.m. Even a charter flight from Fort Wayne to New York would take about two hours, and we don&#39;t think she could have rushed from the Fort Wayne event, flown to New York, checked into the Waldorf and ordered room service in that brief window of time.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo the e-mail flying around the Internet that says Michelle Obama ordered $400 of lobster and Iranian caviar is just wrong, and because it&#39;s a mock-up based on a retracted news item, we rate it Pants on Fire!</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:27:53.761900", "ruling_date": "2008-12-02T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Official-looking receipt is a fake", "ruling_headline_slug": "official-looking-receipt-is-a-fake", "ruling_link_text": "Official-looking receipt is a fake", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCharlotte Observer, Obama meets working moms, April 9, 2008, accessed via Nexis</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNew York Post, <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/10212008/gossip/pagesix/room_disservice_134490.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> Room Disservice </a> , Oct. 21, 2008</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPuma PAC, <a href=\"http://pumapac.org/2008/10/21/i-regret-the-error/\" target=\"_blank\"> I regret the error </a> , Oct. 21, 2008</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInterview with Waldorf Astoria spokeswoman</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCNN transcript, <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0810/15/cnr.05.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Michelle Obama speaks in Indiana </a> , Oct. 15, 2008</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Fake_news", "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "", "false_count": 44, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "", "id": 27, "last_name": "Chain email", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "chain-email", "pants_count": 106, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-emailer.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/27/", "total_count": 180, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tMichelle Obama ordered $400 worth of lobster and caviar at a New York hotel.</p>", "statement_context": "a chain e-mail", "statement_date": "2008-10-19", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
