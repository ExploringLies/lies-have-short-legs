Matt Huffman, the majority floor leader, said at a news conference at the Statehouse to roll out this year&rsquo;s party agenda.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHouse Republicans proclaimed the same message last year after they reclaimed the majority in the 2010 fall election.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut state Rep. Armond Budish, the minority leader in the house, would beg to differ. He asserts that House Republicans instead pushed an agenda to diminish workers&rsquo; rights, voting rights and abortion rights.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We&#39;ve seen more anti-women&#39;s choice bills introduced in the first half of this session than we&#39;ve seen in the last three General Assemblies,&quot; Budish said at a Jan. 31 news conference announcing his party&#39;s priorities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio asked Budish&#39;s office for the numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey provided a list identifying legislation that would restrict abortion that was introduced last year and from previous General Assemblies. We checked that list ourselves, too, using the search engine for laws, acts and legislation on the legislature&#39;s website.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe list, we noted, includes such measures as HB 125, prohibiting abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected, and HB 153, the state operating budget, which contained two provisions restricting access to abortion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt did not include such measures as HB 180, creating the &quot;Massillon Tiger Football Booster Club&quot; license plate and prohibiting any money raised by it to go to &quot;abortion-related activities.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe list showed 11 bills that would affect abortion rights from 2011, the first session of the 129th General Assembly. That&rsquo;s more than any of the three previous two-year sessions. There were eight bills in 128th General Assembly, nine in the 127th and six in the 126th.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Budish&#39;s statement as True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-02-02T18:41:13.655423", "ruling_date": "2012-02-03T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Armond Budish says more bills limiting abortion were introduced last year than in any of the previous three General Assemblies", "ruling_headline_slug": "armond-budish-says-more-bills-limiting-abortion-we", "ruling_link_text": "2011 total tops previous two-year sessions", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Plain Dealer, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2012/01/ohio_house_republicans_roll_ou.html\" target=\"blank\">Ohio House Republicans roll out this year&#39;s agenda; collective bargaining reform not a priority</a>,&quot; Jan. 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOhioCapitalBlog, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Vaf6GrGT3gU#\" target=\"blank\">House Dems Priorities</a>,&quot; posted to YouTube Jan. 31, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=18X4OASEQ1DbZOALt8RMXpZvTFSnWIOqbZaSx97CVZIkpyuOlt7aeGl9lQ6UZ\" target=\"blank\">List of anti-abortion legislation</a> emailed &nbsp;from State Rep.
