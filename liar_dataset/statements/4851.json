Michele Bachmann of Minnesota criticized Gingrich&rsquo;s position on immigration during a television interview on the PBS program &quot;NewsHour&quot; the day after the Republican candidates gathered for a debate on national security issues. Gingrich made headlines for what he described during the debate as his &quot;humane&quot; -- and critics call his soft -- approach on immigration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;[Gingrich] has said that we should make the 11 million illegal workers that are in this country legal,&quot; Bachmann said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBachmann then argued that Gingrich &quot;probably has the most liberal position on illegal immigration of any of the candidates in the race.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered about what Bachmann claimed Gingrich said since he seemed to say something different during the Nov. 22 debate on CNN.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I don&#39;t see how the party that says it&#39;s the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families that have been here a quarter century,&quot; Gingrich said at the debate. &quot;And I&#39;m prepared to take the heat for saying, &#39;Let&#39;s be humane in enforcing the law without giving them citizenship but by finding a way to create legality so that they are not separated from their families.&#39; &quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBachmann&rsquo;s campaign website has a link to an article that seems to defend her statement on PBS. The December 2010 article, on Fox Nation news website, has a quote from Gingrich using the 11 million illegal immigrant number.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We are not going to deport 11 million people,&quot; Gingrich is quoted as saying at a forum on Latino issues. &quot;There has to be some zone between deportation and amnesty.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond pointed to the latter part of the candidate&rsquo;s quote to argue Bachmann&rsquo;s claim was misleading.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Newt&#39;s quote about the need for a zone between deportation and [amnesty] is proof alone Bachmann&#39;s claim is false, an outright lie,&quot; Hammond told us via e-mail.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Fox Nation article quotes Gingrich as saying his position is &quot;not a call for amnesty.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn his campaign website, Gingrich has a 10-step plan on immigration. He talks about creating a system of committees that would determine which illegal immigrants can stay and which ones must return to their homeland. Gingrich also says illegal immigrants who are criminals and/or gang members should be deported promptly.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We need a path to legality, but not citizenship, for some of these individuals who have deep ties to America, including family, church and community ties,&quot; Gingrich wrote. &quot;We also need a path to swift but dignified repatriation for those who are transient and have no roots in America.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe sent a request for comment to Bachmann&rsquo;s campaign but got no response.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBachmann defended her position in a statement she released to news outlets last weekend. CNN reported the statement included a letter signed by Gingrich and 14 other conservatives in 2004 that was published in The Wall Street Journal that supported then-President George W. Bush&rsquo;s guest worker program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The president has shown courage by calling on Congress to place reality over rhetoric and recognize that those already working here outside the law are unlikely to leave,&quot; the letter states. &quot;Congress can fulfill its role by establishing sufficient increases in legal immigration and paths to permanent residence to enable more workers to stay, assimilate, and become part of America.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBachmann said in her statement: &quot;I don&rsquo;t agree that you should make 11 million workers legal here because that in effect is amnesty and will only encourage more illegal immigrants to come here.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrich -- through his comments at the CNN debate, his website and by signing the 2004 letter -- believes there are some illegal immigrants working in the United States who should be provided a path to legal status and others should be deported. He has not said all illegal immigrants working here &quot;should be made legal.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBachmann has implied something different when she said Gingrich &quot;has said that we should make the 11 million illegal workers that are in this country legal.&quot; She has transformed Gingrich&rsquo;s nuanced statement into an all-or-nothing pronouncement. And she has done so to win favor with a sector of the GOP base opposed to any compromise on illegal immigration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe find Bachmann&rsquo;s statement misleading and rate it False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-28T15:25:15.998911", "ruling_date": "2011-11-29T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Did Gingrich say he supports amnesty for all illegal immigrants?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-gingrich-say-he-supports-amnesty-all-illegal-i", "ruling_link_text": "No safe haven for Bachmann claim about Newt", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;PBS NewsHour,&quot; &quot;<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/july-dec11/bachmann_11-23.html\">Bachmann: Gingrich&rsquo;s Immigration Stance &lsquo;Most Liberal&rsquo; In GOP Race</a>,&quot; Nov. 23, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/23/politics/gingrich-immigration/index.html\">Political gamble for Gingrich on immigration</a>,&quot; Nov. 23, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFox Nation, &quot;<a href=\"http://nation.foxnews.com/newt-gingrich/2010/12/02/newt-we-are-not-going-deport-11-million-people#ixzz1dW7fbVeW\">Newt: &lsquo;We are not going to deport 11 million people</a>,&rsquo; &quot; Dec. 2, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail from Gingrich spokesman R.C.
