Raising that figure toward the national average of 31 percent would give Ohio&rsquo;s economy a tremendous boost. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile Petro told the crowd he&rsquo;s seen various estimates of the economic impact of a rising bachelor&rsquo;s degree rate, he said he had a &quot;solid&quot; and &quot;good&quot; estimate. Every 1 percent increase in the number of Ohioans with bachelor&rsquo;s degrees, Petro said, would mean multiple billions a year in sustained economic growth. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;For every percent we move up, it means economic activity growing the next year and for each year thereafter (by) $2.5 billion dollars,&quot; he said. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile the correlation between education levels and higher wages for individuals is fairly well-established, we were struck by the specific price tag Petro was able to put on Ohioans getting their sheepskins. So PolitiFact Ohio checked it out. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSpencer Waugh, a policy liaison for the Ohio Board of Regents, sent us three documents to corroborate Petro&rsquo;s claim. In an e-mail, Waugh said Petro&rsquo;s estimate of $2.5 billion is &quot;fair and conservative&quot; given that some studies show less and at least one study shows more. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first document was a memo from Waugh to Petro which claimed that a 1 percent jump in Ohioans with bachelor&rsquo;s degrees would net an income increase of $1.09 billion. Waugh&rsquo;s memo multiples the number of new Ohioans with bachelor&rsquo;s degrees by $19,000 a year &mdash; a figure he says represents the annual gain for those going from holding a high school diploma to a bachelor&rsquo;s degree.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWaugh&rsquo;s figures were based on a data from the National Center for Education Statistics as well as 2007 census data, according to Kim Norris, Petro&rsquo;s communications director. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe 2007 census data states that the gap is $20,000 per year for adults. The National Center for Education Statistics data shows the gap at $18,000 for males but only $15,000 for females in the age group of 25-34. So $19,000 is in the ballpark.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing the $19,000 multiplier assumes that everyone who went back to school and got the bachelor&rsquo;s degree had only achieved a high school education. Presumably some in that group would be people who already have associate&rsquo;s degrees or &quot;some college&quot; and didn&rsquo;t have far to go to get a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. People who have &quot;some college&quot; or an associate&rsquo;s degree generally make more than those with just a high school diploma, and that would have an impact on net benefit to Ohio&rsquo;s economy. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRegardless, the figure is well below Petro&rsquo;s estimate of $2.5 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second document is a memo from Board of Regents staffer Patrick Maloney to Petro which outlines a 2008 Arizona State University study which found that a 1 percent jump would add $1.5 billion to that state&rsquo;s economy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ASU study focuses solely on Arizona and relies on a 2004 Journal of Econometrics paper that estimated the effects on the earnings of all working adults from increasing the proportion of the workforce with a university degree. It used data from the 1980 and 1990 census. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, the paper&rsquo;s author, Enrico Moretti, didn&rsquo;t specify how he defined adults nor how he calculated hourly wages. And Moretti finds a &quot;spillover effect&quot; which pushes up wages for all workers on every education level as the share of workers with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree increases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause Moretti&rsquo;s spillover effect requires different calculations over each level of educational attainment, it&rsquo;s virtually impossible to compare Arizona to Ohio as the states have different profiles. Additionally, Arizona&rsquo;s labor market is much smaller than Ohio&rsquo;s with only 1.82 million workers year-round versus 5.11 million in Ohio &mdash; nearly three times as many. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf the gains projected in Arizona would come true in Ohio, then you could probably assume an economic benefit of nearly three times what was projected for Arizona -- about $4 billion a year. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe third study cited by Waugh comes from a CEO for Cities study, which concludes that an improvement of 1 percentage point in each of the 51 largest metropolitan areas in the United State would increase aggregate personal income by $124 billion nationwide. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the report, the authors explain that each additional percentage point in aggregate adult four-year college attainment was associated with a $763 increase in annual regional per capita income.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPer capita income refers to the income of each man, women and child. If we apply the increase to Ohio&rsquo;s &nbsp;11.5 million population, we get an additional $8.8 billion a year in income.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo where does all this leave Petro&rsquo;s claim? <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs chancellor of the Board of Regents, Petro wanted to show the importance of more adults getting their college degrees. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo underscore this point, Petro claimed that a &quot;good and solid&quot; estimate showed that increasing the number of bachelor&rsquo;s degree holders in Ohio by 1 percent would increase &quot;economic activity&quot; in the state by $2.5 billion a year. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked for studies to prove this point, Petro&rsquo;s staffers muster a pair of memos which assert Ohio&rsquo;s income would rise by $1.09 billion a year and another which estimates that Arizona&rsquo;s would rise by $1.5 billion a year. The Arizona estimate would extrapolate to about $4 billion in Ohio given the larger labor market here. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLastly, they cite a study done on the nation&rsquo;s biggest urban areas, which if applied to Ohio&rsquo;s population would mean $8.8 billion in additional income. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe underlying point in Petro&rsquo;s statement is accurate -- that raising the percentage of Ohioans who have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree would benefit Ohio&rsquo;s economy. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat is less clear is how great that benefit would be. Petro&rsquo;s estimate was $2.5 billion. But the supporting documentation his staff provided shows that estimates very wildly. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs it $1 billion? $4 billion? $8.8 billion? &nbsp;Something in between?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a point that needs clarification. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter the claim rates as Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-08-29T18:59:21.386168", "ruling_date": "2011-08-30T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Chancellor Jim Petro says boosting bachelor's degrees in Ohio would boost economy", "ruling_headline_slug": "chancellor-jim-petro-says-boosting-bachelors-degre", "ruling_link_text": "Sorting out dollar estimate requires higher degree", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tOhio Channel, &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ohiochannel.org/MediaLibrary/Media.aspx?fileId=132364\">Board of Regents Chancellor Jim Petro remarks at Ohio State University</a>, Aug. 11, 2011.
