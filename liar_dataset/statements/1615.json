He said that the new law would cost  Florida at least $1.6 billion a year, and likely more.</p>\r\n<p>But it  appears those numbers are based on reports that don't reflect the final  version of the health care reform law. His numbers were first  questioned by a news report from the Web site <a href=\"http://www.healthnewsflorida.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Health News Florida</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\"The AHCA folks, the Agency for Health Care  Administration in Tallahassee, that pays out Medicaid, estimates that it will be at least $1.6 billion more a year in costs to the sate of Florida, just for what they do,\" McCollum said.</p>\r\n<p>We  wanted to look into McCollum's numbers, and how the Medicaid expansion  works.<br /><br />Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government-run health  care program for the very poor. (Its cousin, Medicare, is for senior  citizens of any income level.) To get into Medicaid, you have to be not  only poor, but also disabled, elderly, pregnant or a child. The new law  changes that, opening up Medicaid to all of the poor, setting the limit  at people who make less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level.  Currently, that means a single person who makes $14,404 or less, and a  family of four that has income of less than $29,327.<br /><br />Medicaid is  actually a voluntary program, so states do not have to participate. But  all states do, because the federal government puts up much of the money  for the program. In Florida, the federal government was scheduled to  pick up 55 percent of the the tab for Medicaid this year. But thanks to  the stimulus, the federal government picked up even more, paying for 68  percent of the program for this year and next.<br /><br />But even though  the federal government is paying for the majority of the program, it  still represents significant spending for the state of Florida. Medicaid  here serves about 2.8 million people at a cost to the state of $19  billion. That's about 28 percent of the state's entire budget going to  health care for the very poor -- a group that doesn't employ lobbyists  or make many campaign contributions.<br /><br />McCollum is correct that the  new law will cost the state money, but much of that cost will be  shouldered by the federal government. The federal government plans to  pick up 100 percent of the tab for the expansion of Medicaid for the  first few years, but after that, the percentage declines. <br /><br />McCollum  said during his press conference announcing the lawsuit that the $1.6  billion was <a href=\"http://ahca.myflorida.com/Medicaid/deputy_secretary/recent_presentations/national_health_care_reform_hhs_appropriations_2010-01-14.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">based  on modeling</a> developed by Florida's Agency for Health Care  Administration. But the agency based that analysis on older versions of  the legislation that weren't as generous to the states as the version  that actually became law. <br /><br />The agency released a new analysis  that is based on the actual bill President Barack Obama signed on Tuesday. The  newer report calculated that Florida's share of increased costs would  range between $149 million in 2014 and $1.1 billion in 2019,  significantly less than what McCollum said. In 2019, by the way, about  1.5 million people previously uninsured would be covered, according to  the report.<br /><br />But it's still possible that Florida's contribution  will be less than that. Congress is currently working on a  reconciliation bill to modify the law Obama signed on; House  Democrats demanded the bill with a number of changes as a condition for  passing the bill Obama signed. We can't say for sure that the  reconciliation bill will become law, but if it does, it could decrease  states' Medicaid contributions even more because the federal government  would pick up even more of the tab for the Medicaid expansion.<br /><br />Here's a chart that shows the difference in those potential contributions:</p>\r\n<table border=\"5\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>Federal contribution,</p>\r\n<p>current law</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>Federal contribution,</p>\r\n<p>with reconciliation</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>2014</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>100 percent</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>100 percent</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>2015</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>100 percent</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>100 percent</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>2016</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>100 percent</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>100 percent</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>2017</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>92 percent</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>95 percent</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>2018</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>91 percent</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>94 percent</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>2019</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>90 percent</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>93 percent</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>AHCA said that the plan's cost of $1.1 billion could  potentially grow to $1.6 billion in 2019. Spokesperson Tiffany <span class=\"srch-Title\">Vause </span>said the agency was working on a new estimate that would include another  $300 million to pay for a required increase in payments to primary care  physicians who see Medicaid patients, and another $100 million to $200  million for unspecified administrative costs that \"will incur to  implement and manage all aspects of the new regulations.\"</p>\r\n<p>The attorney general's office said they agreed with AHCA's conclusion. McCollum is also a Republican candidate for governor; his campaign staff referred the request to the attorney general's office because they said it was a matter of official state business</p>\r\n<p>Getting  back to our ruling, McCollum said that it would cost Florida $1.6  billion or more to expand Medicaid. He is correct that Florida will have  to pay more money into Medicaid to insure more of the poor. But the  feds pick up most of the tab for the expansion in the early years, at a  much lower cost than $1.6 billion. It only hits close to that top  figure in 2019, and still have questions about the unspecified  implementation costs. We find his claim Half True.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> This report has been updated to include comment from the attorney  general's office received after our original publication.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-23T17:57:11.741528", "ruling_date": "2010-03-23T18:52:51", "ruling_headline": "McCollum cites top estimate for Medicaid expansion", "ruling_headline_slug": "mccollum-cites-top-estimate-medicaid-expansion", "ruling_link_text": "McCollum cites highest number possible", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Health News Florida, <a href=\"http://www.healthnewsflorida.org/index.cfm/go/public.articleView/article/16738\" target=\"_blank\">Cost  depends on assumptions</a>, March 23, 2010<br /><br />WESH, <a href=\"http://www.wesh.com/video/22909275/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"McCollum plans lawsuit over health care reform\">McCollum plans  lawsuit over health care reform</a>, March 22, 2010<br /><br />CNN, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/03/22/health.care.lawsuit/index.html?eref=rss_us&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_us+%28RSS%3A+U.S.%29\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"10 states line up to sue over health bill, Florida AG  says\">10 states line up to sue over health bill, Florida AG says</a>,  March 23, 2010<br /><br />U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, <a href=\"http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/fmap10.htm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Federal  Medical Assistance Percentages and Enhanced  Federal Medical Assistance  Percentages for Fiscal Year 2010\">Federal Medical Assistance Percentages  and Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentages for Fiscal Year  2010</a><br /><br />Recovery.gov, <span class=\"srch-Title\"><a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/News/press/Documents/HHS+IG+Report+90900075-508+Compliant.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.recovery.gov/News/press/Documents/HHS+IG+Report+90900075-508+Compliant.pdf\">Review  of the Calculations of Temporary Increases in Federal Medical  Assistance Percentages</a>, March 23, 2010<br /><br />Agency for Health Care  Administration, <a href=\"http://ahca.myflorida.com/Medicaid/deputy_secretary/recent_presentations/national_health_care_reform_hhs_appropriations_2010-01-14.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Overview of National Health Care Reform Proposals\">Overview  of National Health Care Reform Proposals</a>, Jan. 14, 2010<br /><br /></span>Agency  for Health Care Administration, Overview of National Health Care Reform  Proposals Passed on 3/21/2010 by the United State House of  Representatives<span class=\"srch-Title\">, obtained by PolitiFact<br /><br />U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services, <a href=\"http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/09poverty.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Federal Poverty Level guidelines\">Federal Poverty Level  gu/idelines</a>, March 23, 2019<br /><br />Interview with Leighton Ku,  professor of health policy, of George Washington University<br /><br />E-mail  interview with Tiffany Vause of the Florida Agency for Health Care  Administration</span></p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Bill", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 325, "last_name": "McCollum", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "bill-mccollum", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Bill_McCollum.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/325/", "total_count": 12, "true_count": 3, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Florida's cost for the Medicaid expansion will be $1.6 billion a year or  more.</p>", "statement_context": "a press conference", "statement_date": "2010-03-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
