Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., talked debt and deficit with Granite Staters at a town hall meeting last month, trying to put the enormous numbers into context for the average person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deficit could buy a large Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts coffee for every American every day for the next four years, she said. It also could pay for new iPhones for half of the people on Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And to really hit home the size of billions of dollars of deficit, Ayotte compared the figure with the salaries of Major League Baseball players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deficit, she said, could pay &quot;all of the 2013 salaries of every professional baseball player for the next 248 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was fitting timing for the comparison. Ayotte donned a Boston Red Sox hat during the town hall, held on the day of Game 2 of the 2013 World Series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also an interesting statistic to cite. Could the deficit actually fund America&rsquo;s favorite pastime for the next two-and-a-half centuries? We did the math.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tracking down the federal deficit was the easy part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time of the town hall event, the Congressional Budget Office&rsquo;s most recent deficit estimate was $753 billion, from the monthly&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44552\">report&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;published in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The baseball numbers are a bit trickier to calculate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each December, Major League Baseball calculates the total payroll of all baseball&nbsp;clubs to see which teams have to pay a luxury tax, incurred by those who have a payroll over the threshold set by MLB. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/8748326/report-new-york-yankees-hit-luxury-tax-10th-straight-year\">2012 spending</a>&nbsp;was $3.15 billion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what about 2013 figures?<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We struck out with both Major League Baseball and the players&rsquo; union, the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Major League Baseball Players Association. The communications office<strong>&nbsp;</strong>said the official 2013 data is currently being calculated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, we relied on Opening Day numbers reported by media organizations, which they attributed to a combination of the players association, club officials and Major League Baseball&rsquo;s central office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to ESPN,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the sum of all the team payrolls on opening day was $3,059,073,869.&nbsp;<em>USA Today&nbsp;</em>and CBS Sports have similar but slightly different numbers -- $3,100,746,107 for&nbsp;<em>USA Today&nbsp;</em>and $3,098,746,107 for CBS Sports. The differences are generally explained by how signing bonuses and deferred money in contracts are counted, and whether injured players are included, said Jeff Euston, a baseball fan who runs a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.baseballprospectus.com/compensation/cots/\">website</a>&nbsp;called Cot&rsquo;s Contracts at Baseball Prospectus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ayotte&rsquo;s math is accurate using the ESPN data -- the source her staff said she used. They said<strong>&nbsp;</strong>she used numbers reported by ESPN and divided that by the federal deficit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2014/assets/14msr.pdf\">estimated</a>&nbsp;by the Office of Management and Budget in July. That&rsquo;s $759 billion divided by $3,059,073,869, or 248 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using numbers from other media organizations, the deficit instead can pay baseball salaries for 238 years or 244 years. Meanwhile, using the CBO&rsquo;s estimate from September brings the years to 236 or 242.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Ruling</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ayotte said the deficit this year could pay &quot;all of the 2013 salaries of every professional baseball player for the next 248 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that she had a couple different options for data, the senator looked to ESPN for sports statistics, which seemed to us like a reasonable choice. The ESPN data produces a result of 248 years. Even if the answer is 236 years or 244 years -- the answer you get if you use different data sources -- it&rsquo;s a long time. We rate her statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-18T12:04:29.557012", "ruling_date": "2013-11-18T12:43:06", "ruling_headline": "Kelly Ayotte compares size of federal deficit, baseball salaries", "ruling_headline_slug": "ayotte-compares-size-federal-deficit-baseball-sala", "ruling_link_text": "She swings -- and connects", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Congressional Budget Office, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44552\"><u>Monthly Budget Review for August 2013</u></a>, Sept. 9, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Budget Office, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44716%20\"><u>Monthly Budget Review - Summary for Fiscal Year 2013</u></a>, Nov. 7, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House Office of Management and Budget, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2014/assets/14msr.pdf\"><u>Mid-Session Review, Budget of the U.S. Government</u></a>, July 8, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USA Today, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/sports/fantasy/baseball/salaries/2013/all/team/all/\"><u>Top Team Payroll</u></a>, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS Sports, <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/salaries/teams\"><u>MLB Salaries, Team Payrolls</u></a>, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ESPN, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/salaries/_/name/bos/boston-red-sox\"><u>Boston Red Sox Salary/Payroll Information</u></a>, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baseball Prospectus, <a href=\"http://www.baseballprospectus.com/compensation/\"><u>2013 League Compensation</u></a>, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ESPN, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/8748326/report-new-york-yankees-hit-luxury-tax-10th-straight-year\"><u>Report: Yanks hit with luxury tax</u></a>, Dec. 18, 2012&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Liz Johnson, Ayotte spokeswoman, Nov. 12, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Major League Baseball public relations office, Nov. 11, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Greg Bouris, Director of Communications for Major League Baseball Players Association, Nov. 11, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Kevin Ota, ESPN Director of Communications, Digitial, Nov. 13, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Jeff Euston, author at Baseball Prospectus, Nov. 13, 2013.</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Kelly ", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "New Hampshire", "id": 1627, "last_name": "Ayotte", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "kelly-ayotte", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Ayotte_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1627/", "total_count": 11, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://ayotte.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>The deficit this year could pay &quot;all of the 2013 salaries of every professional baseball player for the next 248 years.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a town hall meeting in Hudson, N.H.", "statement_date": "2013-10-24", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 166, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/166/", "subject": "Baseball", "subject_slug": "baseball", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 183, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/183/", "subject": "Deficit", "subject_slug": "deficit", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
