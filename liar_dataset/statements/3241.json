Radtke, a Tea Party activist who is seeking next year&rsquo;s GOP Senate nomination, called Webb&rsquo;s retirement &quot;a great opportunity to change the direction of our country.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Senator Webb was a reliable vote for President Obama and Senator Harry Reid and their ruinous agenda,&quot; Radtke said in a written statement released on Feb. 11, the day Webb made announcement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWebb, a former Republican turned Democrat, has always had a reputation for charting his own course. We wondered how much he was in sync with Obama and Reid, a Nevada Democrat who is Senate majority leader.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe turned to the voting records.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to data compiled by non-partisan OpenCongress, Webb and Reid have voted together 1,325 times since Jan. 2007, when Webb joined the Senate. They have a &quot;voting similarity&quot; of 85 percent, according to the web site. Democratic senators average an 89 percent voting similarity.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Washington Post also maintains an exhaustive congressional database. It shows Webb voted with a majority of Democratic senators 87 percent of the time during last Congress from 2009-11. Reid, during the same span, voted with his party 95 percent of the time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Post&rsquo;s review of the 111th Congress includes 689 votes. Many were not controversial and supported by both sides of the aisle.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe looked at Webb&rsquo;s record on President Barack Obama&rsquo;s key initiatives. Webb and Reid were always in his corner. They voted for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as health care reform.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or stimulus bill.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe New START nuclear arms agreement with Russia.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe repeal of &quot;Don&rsquo;t Ask, Don&rsquo;t Tell,&quot; a policy barring openly gay men and women from the military.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe DREAM Act, which would grant citizenship to undocumented immigrants who serve in the military or attend college.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe deal between Obama and Congressional Republicans that extended the Bush-era tax cuts and added some payroll tax reductions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe Supreme Court nominations of Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt is worth noting that Webb, despite supporting the president and his party on a very consistent basis, has been scored as one of the more contrarian Democrats by Congressional Quarterly. In the 111th Congress only five other senators went against the party&rsquo;s majority more often than Webb did. But voting with your party 87 percent of the time still sounds consistent to us.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut voting with your party 87 percent of the time still sounds consistent to us. And on the highest-profile issues, Webb and Reid have backed the president.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate Radtke&rsquo;s statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-16T10:04:45.455284", "ruling_date": "2011-02-16T10:03:13", "ruling_headline": "Jamie Radtke says Sen.
