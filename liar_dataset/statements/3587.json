Eric Cantor&rsquo;s position on Social Security gives us a sense of deja vu.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Campaign for America&rsquo;s Future, a liberal advocacy group, has aired the television ad this month in Cantor&rsquo;s 7th District saying the congressman is a threat to the retirement dreams of Americans younger than 55.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Congressman Eric Cantor wants to eliminate Social Security,&quot; the narrator intones in the 31-second spot, based on a comment the majority leader made in a March 21 appearance before the conservative Hoover Institution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad supports the claim with an audio snippet of Cantor&rsquo;s response to a question from the audience. Speaking about entitlement programs such as Social Security, Cantor said it&rsquo;s important to protect benefits for those 55 and older.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;But for the rest of us, listen, we&rsquo;re going to have to come to grips with the fact that these programs cannot exist if we want America to be what we want America to be,&quot; Cantor said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn recent weeks, scads of liberal politicians, organizations and bloggers have been pouncing on the same statement to argue it&rsquo;s evidence the GOP is showing its true intentions to end Social Security.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne of groups, Americans United for Change, used the comment to argue Cantor wanted to eliminate Social Security and Medicare.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an April 1 Truth-O-Meter, PolitiFact national rated that claim False, pointing out that in other public appearances Cantor has called for <em>changing</em>, not <em>abolishing </em>entitlement programs like Social Security.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeconds after making the Hoover statement that sparked the frenzy, Cantor added:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We&rsquo;re going to have to accept some changes as far as the rest of us, and what we&rsquo;re saying is for those 55 and older (they) do not have to worry about changes in benefits, but for the rest of us we will,&quot; Cantor said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are other statements showing Cantor envisions a future with Social Security:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t*In a Feb. 19 op-ed in Politico, he said the country&rsquo;s entitlement programs &quot;will not be available for our children unless they are modernized and reformed.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t*In a March 16 interview with CNBC, he said, &quot;If you look at these entitlement programs, what we&rsquo;ve got to admit to ourselves is they&rsquo;re not going to be around in their current state unless we significantly alter who we are as a country.&quot; He said that for workers 54 and younger, Republicans were going to insist on dealing &quot;with the fact that if these programs are going to be around, they&rsquo;re going to have to look a lot different.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t*In the April 13 <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em>, Cantor again said if programs like Social Security are to remain viable, they must change for those under 55. &quot;We want them to be around because we care about those who need our help,&quot; Cantor said. &quot;We want a safety net in place that actually is there for people who need it, not for those who don&rsquo;t.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRobert L. Borosage, the co-director of the Campaign for America&rsquo;s Future, sent us an email insisting Cantor does want to end Social Security and saying his comment at Hoover isn&rsquo;t the only proof.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBorosage sent us a link to a portion of an April 10 appearance Cantor made on Fox News Sunday. While talking about the Republican 2012 budget plan and entitlements, Cantor said &quot;I know those programs are not going to be there for me when I retire, just like everyone else 54 and younger. They can&rsquo;t. We can&rsquo;t sustain that kind of trajectory.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut a review of the full interview on Fox showed that as Cantor talked about the House GOP 2012 budget, he also said Republicans are &quot;talking about changing the way that the entitlements work in this country for the future while protecting today&rsquo;s seniors.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCantor has been short on specifics about how he would reform Social Security.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s recap:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Campaign for America&rsquo;s Future used part of a comment Cantor made at the Hoover Institution to argue the congressman wants to eliminate Social Security for those under 55..<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Cantor had a made a number of statements, previous to the ad, which show that is not his position. The Majority Leader has said the program must be <em>changed &nbsp;</em>to remain viable, not <em>eliminated</em>, even though he has been short on specifics about how he would reform Social Security.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt would have been easy for the Campaign for America&rsquo;s Future to find those statements before they ran the ad. Instead, they cherry-picked a Cantor comment and gave it no context.
