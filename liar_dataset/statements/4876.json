Loretta Weinberg isn&rsquo;t shy about attacking Gov. Chris Christie, but when it comes to him not making pension payments, she could show a little patience.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Bergen County Democrat took aim in a recent column on bluejersey.com at the Republican governor&rsquo;s record of making no payments to the state&rsquo;s pension funds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He has not paid one dollar of state money into our pension system, and then states that the system is broke,&quot; Weinberg wrote in a Nov. 21 column on the left-leaning blog.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey determined that Weinberg&rsquo;s claim is technically correct, but still somewhat misleading.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Christie administration has not yet made a pension contribution, but a payment of nearly $500 million is scheduled to be made before the current fiscal year ends in June 2012. That amount represents a fraction of the nearly $3.4 billion needed to fully fund the state&rsquo;s fiscal year contribution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven though one is scheduled, Weinberg argued in a phone interview that Christie has not made any pension payments.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Whether he&rsquo;ll do it in the future, we&rsquo;ll see,&quot; said Weinberg, before referring to her statement. &quot;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s misleading....It&rsquo;s a statement of fact.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s review Christie&rsquo;s track record with the pension system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the fiscal year 2011 budget -- Christie&rsquo;s first spending plan -- the governor did not make any pension contributions, even though a payment of about $3 billion was required to fully fund the state&rsquo;s share in that fiscal year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in March 2010, Christie signed a law passed by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, requiring the state to make one-seventh of the full contribution. That policy kicks off with fiscal year 2012, which began in July of this year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state&rsquo;s payment is slated to increase by at least an additional one-seventh in each succeeding fiscal year until the full amount is paid in the seventh fiscal year and afterwards.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie approved a fiscal year 2012 budget that includes that one-seventh payment for a combined contribution of about $484 million to six pension funds. The full contribution would be nearly $3.4 billion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, Weinberg also agreed to make a pension payment by way of voting for the fiscal year 2012 budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe actual payment will be made at some point during the next seven months in order to use cash on hand, according to Andrew Pratt, a Treasury Department spokesman. Making the pension payment now would likely mean borrowing money, Pratt said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHistorically, pension payments are made in the final few weeks of a fiscal year, Pratt told us. Toward the end of a fiscal year, more tax revenue is coming in and most other expenses have been paid, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s a fiscally prudent thing to do,&quot; Pratt said. &quot;It&rsquo;s always better to pay in cash.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tState officials also approved pension and health benefit reform last summer, requiring greater employee contributions toward the benefits. The Christie administration has said the reform would save $120 billion in pension costs over the next 30 years.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an online column, Weinberg claimed Christie &quot;has not paid one dollar of state money into our pension system.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s technically true that Christie has not yet made a pension contribution, but the governor has agreed to make a combined payment of about $484 million to six pension funds during fiscal year 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/12/politifact_nj_sen_loretta_wein.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-12-01T14:12:58.149291", "ruling_date": "2011-12-02T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Loretta Weinberg criticizes Chris Christie for not making any pension payments", "ruling_headline_slug": "loretta-weinberg-criticizes-chris-christie-for-not", "ruling_link_text": "Payment is scheduled", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBlueJersey.com, <a href=\"http://www.bluejersey.com/diary/19858/a-tale-of-two-new-jerserys\">A Tale of Two New Jerseys!</a>, Nov. 21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Department of the Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/omb/publications/12citizensguide/pdf/citguide.pdf\">Fiscal Year 2011-2012: Citizens&rsquo; Guide to the Budget</a>, October 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Star-Ledger, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/10/christie_fix_didnt_save_nj_pen.html\">Christie&#39;s overhaul may not save N.J. pension system</a>, Oct. 23, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Department of the Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/pensions/pdf/financial/2011divisioncombined.pdf\">Division of Pensions and Benefits: Financial Statements and Schedules</a>, June 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Office of Legislative Services, <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/legislativepub/budget_2012/INTER_analysis_2012.pdf\">Analysis of the Fiscal Year 2011-2012 Budget: Interdepartmental Accounts</a>, May 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Office of Legislative Services, <a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/legislativepub/budget_2012/fy_12_scoring.pdf\">Appropriations Act FY 2012 Summary Totals</a>, July 20, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/pensions/pdf/laws/chapt1-2010.pdf\">Senate bill S-2</a>, signed into law by Gov.
