Many Democrats oppose Keystone, but some red-state Democrats would like to see it happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On <em>Fox News Sunday</em> Nov. 16, host Chris Wallace painted the upcoming vote as a last-ditch effort to help Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., as she faces a tight runoff vote against a Republican challenger. Otherwise, why would Senate&nbsp;Majority Leader Harry Reid rush to a vote,&nbsp;he asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, has blocked any vote on the Keystone pipeline for years,&quot; Wallace said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon after, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., appearing on the show, tried to correct the record -- saying Reid has offered up a Keystone vote multiple times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Harry Reid twice offered votes on Keystone on the Shaheen bill,&quot; Whitehouse said, referring to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.&nbsp;&quot;And the Republicans refused to allow those votes because they didn&rsquo;t want the Shaheen bill to pass before the election. It would have been good for her in New Hampshire to pass a major piece of bipartisan legislation like that. So the Republicans had a chance to vote on Keystone and turned it down.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Whitehouse&rsquo;s comments in mind, we decided to see if Wallace was correct to say Reid has &quot;blocked any vote on the Keystone pipeline for years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Shaheen bill</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in May, the Senate was considering a bipartisan energy efficiency bill sponsored by Shaheen, a Democrat, and Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twice, Reid said he would allow a Keystone pipeline vote if the Senate <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senate-expected-to-deadlock-on-energy-bill-ending-chances-of-a-vote-on-keystone/2014/05/12/9018fd76-d9fb-11e3-8009-71de85b9c527_story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>approved</u></a> the Shaheen bill first. But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Republicans <a href=\"http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/205903-gop-blocks-energy-bill-scuttling-keystone-vote\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>rejected</u></a> both offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a little more complicated than a simple trade, of course, because Reid had blocked several Republican amendments to the Shaheen bill. So, in a sort of protest vote against Reid,&nbsp;who routinely quashes Republican measures,&nbsp;Republicans rejected his offer, killed the Shaheen bill and lost an opportunity to vote on Keystone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the amendments that Republicans tried to attach to the Shaheen bill would have <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/democratic-leader-blocks-senate-vote-keystone\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>approved</u></a> the Keystone pipeline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Landrieu, Shaheen and Reid made the same offer again in the summer, and Republicans again rejected it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom line: To hear a Democrat tell the story, Republicans passed on an opportunity to vote on Keystone. But to a hear a Republican tell it, Reid attached so many strings to the Keystone vote, that there was no way Republicans would have been able to support it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other measures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Shaheen bill wasn&rsquo;t the only time the Senate has considered Keystone legislation in the past couple of years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in March 2012, the Senate <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00034\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>voted</u></a> on a Keystone approval amendment, sponsored by Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D. The measure failed, even with some Democrats voting alongside Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2013, the Senate <a href=\"http://www.hoeven.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2013/3/hoeven-baucus-senate-passes-bipartisan-amendment-in-support-of-keystone-xl-project\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>passed</u></a> a similar Hoeven amendment, 62-37, approving the Keystone pipeline. But the amendment was non-binding -- and thus largely symbolic. The amendment was attached to a Senate budget resolution, which Reid does not have the ability to block.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been five standalone bills in the Senate seeking Keystone approval, one introduced by Landrieu and four introduced by Hoeven. None have come up for a vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The House, on the other hand, has approved the Keystone pipeline nine times, according to <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4574086?7&amp;search=EUc5UHFT\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Congressional Quarterly</u></a>, most recently on Nov. 14. Of course, none of these measures have made it through the Senate, contributing to Republicans&rsquo; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/06/lynn-jenkins/rep-lynn-jenkins-blames-harry-reid-do-nothing-sena/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>complaint</u></a> that House bills die at Reid&rsquo;s desk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wallace said &quot;Reid has blocked any vote on the Keystone pipeline for years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In actuality, several amendments approving Keystone have come up for a vote in the Senate. And Reid and other top Democratic senators have offered Keystone votes several times as part of a broader legislative compromise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Reid has generally blocked a simple up-or-down vote on the pipeline, using it either as a bargaining chip or by ignoring legislation coming from the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wallace&rsquo;s claim is partially accurate but goes too far by saying &quot;any vote.&quot; We rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-11-16T10:04:50.212932", "ruling_date": "2014-11-16T16:51:51", "ruling_headline": "Chris Wallace: Harry Reid 'blocked any vote' on Keystone XL pipeline for years", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-wallace-harry-reid-blocked-any-vote-keystone", "ruling_link_text": "Reid's allowed a few votes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Fox News Su</em><a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday-chris-wallace/2014/11/16/battles-brewing-over-immigration-obamacare-climate-change\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><em>nday</em>, <u>tran</u><u>script</u></a>, Nov. 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Quarterly, vote searches, accessed Nov. 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress.gov, legislation searches, accessed Nov. 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Hill</em>,<a href=\"http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/205903-gop-blocks-energy-bill-scuttling-keystone-vote\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> &quot;<u>GOP blocks energy bill, scuttling vote on Keystone XL pipeli</u><u>ne</u></a>,&quot; May 12, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Hill,</em> <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/289941-senate-endorses-keystone-xl-through-budget-amendment\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Keystone XL picks up Senate backing,&quot;</u></a> March 22, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Associated Press</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/democratic-leader-blocks-senate-vote-keystone\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hopes for Keystone XL vote fade as talks fail,</u></a>&quot; May 7, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CQ News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/news-4574086?8&amp;search=EUc5UHFT\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>House Approves Keystone XL Pipeline ...
