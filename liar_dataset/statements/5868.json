Recently, Obama offered a specific claim about how wealthier Americans would benefit from Romney&rsquo;s tax plan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a May 5, 2012, campaign <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/05/remarks-president-and-first-lady-campaign-event\">speech</a> in Columbus, Ohio, Obama said, &quot;My opponent won&rsquo;t tell us how he&rsquo;d pay for his new, $5 trillion tax cut -- a tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wondered whether <a href=\"http://www.promotesigns.com/Tax.htm\">Romney&rsquo;s tax proposal</a> really would be so generous to millionaires. (The Romney campaign didn&#39;t respond to our inquiry for this story.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst, some background on what Romney is proposing. Here are some of key elements of his plan, according to the campaign&rsquo;s website.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor individuals:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull; Cut marginal rates by one-fifth on a permanent, across-the-board basis<br />\r\n&bull; Eliminate interest, dividend, and capital gains taxes for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income below $200,000<br />\r\n&bull; Eliminate the estate tax<br />\r\n&bull; Repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor corporations:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull; Cut the corporate rate to 25 percent<br />\r\n&bull; Make permanent the research and development tax credit<br />\r\n&bull; Switch to a territorial tax system<br />\r\n&bull; Repeal the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Romney campaign&#39;s website states that lowering both individual and corporate tax rates will stimulate economic growth. High tax rates &quot;discourage work and entrepreneurship, as well as savings and investment,&quot; the website states. &quot;With 54 percent of private sector workers employed outside of corporations, individual rates also define the incentives for job-creating businesses. Lower marginal tax rates secure for all Americans the economic gains from tax reform.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in a speech on March 30, 2012, Romney affirmed his plan to cut taxes for everyone:&nbsp;&quot;Taxes should be as low as possible, in line with those of competing nations, and designed to foster innovation and growth. That&#39;s why I will cut marginal tax rates across the board. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For an independent assessment of Romney&rsquo;s plan, we turned to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a think tank that, among other things, evaluates the tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates. While judging tax proposals is subject to some degree of interpretation, the Tax Policy Center has a significant degree of respect in tax circles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Tax Policy Center looked at two versions of Romney&rsquo;s tax proposal. We will use the <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/romney-plan.cfm\">analysis</a> of the more recent of Romney&rsquo;s two plans, which the group published in March 2012.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore we look at the center&rsquo;s analysis, we should note that the group ran two sets of numbers. One version, known as &quot;current law,&quot; essentially gives Romney credit for extending the tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush and for an annual adjustment in the Alternative Minimum Tax. Under this calculation, taxpayers&rsquo; savings from these two extensions are added to the total tax cuts from Romney&rsquo;s tax proposal itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe other version, known as &quot;current policy,&quot; assumes that the Bush and AMT tax cuts will be extended, with or without Romney. This method only counts the taxpayer savings from the new proposals in Romney&rsquo;s tax plan&nbsp; -- a smaller amount of tax savings than Romney would see under the &quot;current law&quot; calculation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt turns out that the <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?Docid=3298\">&quot;current policy&quot; calculation</a> is the one that backs up Obama&rsquo;s claim. The Tax Policy Center found that under Romney&rsquo;s proposal, people with $1 million or more in annual cash income will receive an average tax cut of $250,535. Those in the millionaire category will receive an 11.8 percent increase in after-tax income, easily the highest of any income group. Collectively, the tax savings for millionaires would amount to nearly one-third of all the tax benefits that result from Romney&rsquo;s plan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?Docid=3296\">&quot;current law&quot; analysis</a> shows even bigger gains for millionaires. By this method, the average tax cut for someone with cash income north of $1 million a year would be $390,876, according to the Tax Policy Center.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd the higher you go on the income scale, the bigger the tax cuts become. Under the center&rsquo;s more restrictive &quot;current policy&quot; method, the <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?Docid=3299\">top one-tenth of 1 percent of taxpayers</a> -- those earning $2,868,534 a year -- would get an average tax cut of $725,716. That accounts for 19.4 percent of all the tax cuts&rsquo; benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven using the more restrictive of the Tax Policy Center&rsquo;s two calculations, Romney&rsquo;s tax plan would save millionaires almost exactly what Obama said -- $250,535. We rate the statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-07T17:08:12.360080", "ruling_date": "2012-05-08T11:06:50", "ruling_headline": "Barack Obama says Mitt Romney's tax plan gives millionaires an average tax cut of $250,000", "ruling_headline_slug": "barack-obama-says-mitt-romneys-tax-plan-gives-mill", "ruling_link_text": "An independent number-cruncher agrees", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Barack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/05/remarks-president-and-first-lady-campaign-event\">speech at Value-City Schottenstein Center Columbus, Ohio</a>, May 5, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMitt Romney for President, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.promotesigns.com/Tax.htm\">Tax: Fairer, Flatter and Simpler</a>,&quot; accessed May 7, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTax Policy Center, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/romney-plan.cfm\">The Romney Plan (Updated),</a>&quot; March 1, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEmail interview with Joseph Rosenberg, research associate for the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, May 7, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Mitt Romney is proposing a &quot;tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech in Columbus, Ohio", "statement_date": "2012-05-05", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 34, "current_job": "Former governor", "false_count": 32, "first_name": "Mitt", "half_true_count": 58, "home_state": "Massachusetts", "id": 5, "last_name": "Romney", "mostly_true_count": 33, "name_slug": "mitt-romney", "pants_count": 19, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-mittromney.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/5/", "total_count": 221, "true_count": 30, "website": "http://www.mittromney.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
