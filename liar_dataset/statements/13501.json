The story also was posted practically verbatim on <a href=\"http://www.the-insider.co/2016/11/26/lady-gaga-reveals-plan-to-cover-her-face-again-until-trump-gets-fired-from-office-and-i-feel-free-once-more/\">several</a> <a href=\"http://www.usafirstinformation.com/lady-gaga-reveals-plan-cover-face-trump-gets-fired-office-feel-free/\">other</a> <a href=\"http://www.usadailyinfo.com/2016/11/lady-gaga-reveals-plan-cover-face-trump-gets-fired-office-feel-free/\">sites</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After a brief synopsis of Gaga saying she lamented losing her privacy to the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/d2smz_1L2_0\">paparazzi</a> as a pop singer, the post quoted her as saying she was opposed to a Trump presidency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House,&quot; the story quoted her as saying. She allegedly told CBS correspondent Lee Cowan that she had moved past &quot;wearing a mask&quot; as she had done with elaborate costumes earlier in her career. She thought Trump was a real <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mP2srT6hh2Y\">monster</a> who would drive her back to the practice, whether it was with makeup or an actual mask.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I&rsquo;m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,&quot; the story quoted her as saying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody&rsquo;s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I&rsquo;m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I&rsquo;ll be going back to wearing a mask.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Gaga did appear in a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lady-gaga-opens-up-on-breakup-from-taylor-kinney-on-cbs-sunday-morning/\"><em>CBS Sunday Morning</em> segment on Nov. 27</a>, the idea that she announced a new kind of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bESGLojNYSo\">poker face</a> turned out to be a bald-faced lie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said no such thing in the nine-minute interview. We also could find no mention of it on her profiles at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ladygaga?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ladygaga/\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ladygaga/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>, or her <a href=\"http://www.ladygaga.com/\">website</a>. (Our inquiries to her Interscope Records label and CBS News went unanswered.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gaga, a Hillary Clinton supporter, did make a number of moves after Election Day, protesting Trump&rsquo;s victory <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ladygaga/status/796301854464479232\">in front of Trump Tower</a>, signing a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/electoral-college-electors-electoral-college-make-hillary-clinton-president-on-december-19\">Change.org petition</a> asking Republican electors to <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/11/donald-trump-electoral-college-petition-to-overturn-election-1201853138/\">switch their votes</a> to Clinton and recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ladygaga/status/795344556908683264\">admonishing Melania Trump&rsquo;s</a> &quot;hypocrisy&quot; for the future first lady&rsquo;s plans for an anti-bullying campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Gaga also really discussed with Cowan how she felt trapped in a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qrO4YZeyl0I\">bad romance</a> with her public persona, unable to freely express herself outside of her own home:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line, I&rsquo;m not free anymore. As soon as I go out into the world, I belong, in a way, to everyone else. It&rsquo;s legal to follow me. It&rsquo;s legal to stalk me at the beach. I can&rsquo;t call the police or ask them to leave. And I took a long, hard look at that property line, and I said, &lsquo;Well, you know, if I can&rsquo;t be free out there, I can be free in here.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nov. 25 story on TheRightists.com used similar, but not identical, wording before launching into the alleged Trump tirade. It&rsquo;s possible the site was able to lift the initial gist of the interview before it aired thanks to a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lady-gaga-joanne-i-miss-a-connection-with-everyday-people/\">Nov. 23 preview</a> of the segment on CBSNews.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site <a href=\"http://therightists.com/about-us/\">bills itself</a> as a &quot;HYBRID site of news and satire,&quot; and that &quot;part of our stories already happens, part, not yet.&quot; It also admits that &quot;NOT all of our stories are true!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no indication which part of the Gaga story might be true and which part was not. Other sites that posted the story didn&rsquo;t specify, either. That gives us a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/WYRJ-ryPEu0\">million reasons</a> to find their claims unreliable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloggers said Lady Gaga announced she would cover her face &quot;until Trump gets fired from office.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original post, which has been taken down, was on a site that billed itself as a hybrid of news and satire, and referenced a real interview on <em>CBS Sunday Morning</em>. There was no indication of what was real and what was made up in the story, and it was copied by several other sites that also didn&rsquo;t identify the fabricated portions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Gaga has spoken out against Trump, there&rsquo;s no mention of him in the CBS interview &mdash; nor did she announce a plan to shield her face out of grief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloggers may have been looking to garner <a href=\"https://youtu.be/pco91kroVgQ\">applause</a> for this one, but Gaga&rsquo;s supposed mask appears to be made out of whole cloth. We rate it Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bace1b99-594a-4d75-9f55-d40d49a08928\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bace1b99-594a-4d75-9f55-d40d49a08928</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-12-01T10:50:50.687092", "ruling_date": "2016-12-01T13:23:56", "ruling_headline": "Lady Gaga did not say she would cover her face until Trump is 'fired from office'", "ruling_headline_slug": "lady-gaga-did-not-say-she-would-cover-her-face-unt", "ruling_link_text": "A satire site looking for fame", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>TheRightists.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://therightists.com/lady-gaga-reveals-plan-to-cover-her-face-again-until-trump-gets-fired-from-office-and-i-feel-free-once-more/\">Lady Gaga Reveals Plan To Cover Her Face Again &lsquo;Until Trump Gets Fired From Office And I Feel Free Once More&rsquo;</a>,&quot; Nov. 25, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>CBS Sunday Morning</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lady-gaga-opens-up-on-breakup-from-taylor-kinney-on-cbs-sunday-morning/\">Lady Gaga opens up on breakup from Taylor Kinney on <em>CBS Sunday Morning</em></a>,&quot; Nov. 27, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>CBS Sunday Morning</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lady-gaga-joanne-i-miss-a-connection-with-everyday-people/\">Lady Gaga: I miss a connection with everyday people</a>,&quot; Nov. 23, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 23, "current_job": "", "false_count": 82, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 14, "home_state": "", "id": 43, "last_name": "Bloggers", "mostly_true_count": 10, "name_slug": "blog-posting", "pants_count": 280, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-bloggers.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/43/", "total_count": 416, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Lady Gaga announced she would cover her face &quot;until Trump gets fired from office.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "posts on the Internet", "statement_date": "2016-11-25", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting discussion happening now about the spread of fake news on the Internet and what companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, among others, should do to stop it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a healthy conversation to have, and one we hope continues in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do something now.
