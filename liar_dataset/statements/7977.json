Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., appeared on Fox News to discuss the future of energy and the environment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;We&#39;ve had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s,&quot; said Wasserman Schultz in a June 28, 2013, interview with Tucker Carlson. &quot;What that means is that communities like mine in South Florida and coastal communities all across the country are facing dangerous sea-level rise, which will ultimately cause homes to be under water in just a few short years.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this item, we won&rsquo;t analyze her projections for future sea-level rises; such estimates are based on a variety of theoretical models and come with lots of uncertainty attached. However, we did wonder whether Wasserman Schultz was correct about past changes -- specifically, whether South Florida has &quot;had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFirst, some background on sea-level rises. &quot;Sea level&quot; refers to the height of the ocean&rsquo;s surface as measured either by a mechanical tide gauge (a method used since the 19th century) or, since the late 1990s, by satellite measurements. The kind of changes Wasserman Schultz mentioned are not short-term changes such as high tide and low tide, but rather average sea-level measurements taken over the course of many years.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe located <a href=\"http://www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/\">sea level data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> for a variety of locations, including Miami Beach, Fla. Using tide gauge data from 1931 to 1981, NOAA found a change equivalent to 0.78 feet in 100 years. That&#39;s roughly nine inches since the 1920s.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe checked with two scientists who specialize in sea-level measurements -- Gary B Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California-Santa Cruz, and Gary Mitchum, a physical oceanographer at the University of South Florida -- and both agreed that the NOAA data was an appropriate source for Wasserman Schultz to rely on. Both scientists considered her claim to be accurate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe will, however, offer two notes of caution when thinking about sea-level rise.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne complication for making these measurements is that the land-based reference point for a tide gauge is not as fixed as it would seem to the naked eye. In reality, the land itself may be rising or falling, masking changes in sea level.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor instance, in some places, such as Alaska or Scandinavia, the land is rising because it&rsquo;s still rebounding from the retreat of heavy glaciers. In other locations, the slow action of plate tectonics is pushing the land upwards. The effect of land rises can be strong: In places like Alaska, the rise in the land has been faster than the rise in sea level, meaning that sea level is actually dropping in relative terms.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy contrast, in Louisiana, <a href=\"http://thelensnola.org/2013/02/21/new-research-louisiana-coast-faces-highest-rate-of-sea-level-rise-on-the-planet/\">the land is sinking</a> due to a variety of landscape changes made by humans. With sea levels rising and the land sinking, the relative change in sea level is especially dramatic.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSouth Florida fits somewhere between these two extremes. But because of the variability in land rise from place to place, it&rsquo;s not appropriate to assume that just because sea level has risen by nine inches in Miami Beach that it has risen by the same amount everywhere.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe second caveat is that past changes in sea level are a whole lot clearer than future changes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/724185-sea-level-paper.html\">2011 paper</a>, Mitchum estimated that sea level in South Florida would rise 32 inches by 2100, with a smaller possibility of a 40-inch rise. However, other estimates have varied, and Mitchum cautions against assigning too much certainty to long-term estimates of sea-level rise.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWasserman Schultz said that in South Florida, &quot;we&#39;ve had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s.&quot; That essentially matches the data collected by the National Oceantic and Atmospheric Administration. While there is considerable uncertainty about the future course of sea-level rises, Wasserman Schultz&rsquo;s estimate of the historical rise appears to be on target. We rate her statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-07-03T15:03:13.218912", "ruling_date": "2013-07-03T16:14:11", "ruling_headline": "Debbie Wasserman Schultz says in South Florida, \"we've had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-south-florida-weve-h", "ruling_link_text": "The past trend is clear; the future course isn't", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tDebbie Wasserman-Schultz,<a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4307172\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> interview with Fox News</a>, June 28, 2013 (CQ subscribers only)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNational Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Sea Levels Online</a>,&quot; accessed July 3, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGary T.
