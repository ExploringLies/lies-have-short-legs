Show the crime scene photos and the NRA is over.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ATFHQ/status/742105007693156352\">reported</a> June 12 that Omar Mateen had been in possession of a 9 millimeter semiautomatic pistol and a .223 caliber AR-type rifle. The latter was later <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/06/13/weapons-used-in-nightclub-shooting-bought-at-ex-nypd-cops-gun-shop/\">identified </a>as a Sig Sauer MCX rifle by the gun shop owner who sold Mateen the gun. Law enforcement has not released the exact type of .223-caliber ammunition used as of this fact-check&rsquo;s publication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, many people responded on Twitter to Moore trying to debunk his tweet, so we took a closer look. We contacted Moore&#39;s office but didn&#39;t hear back.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is the Geneva Convention?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1949 <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/publications/icrc-002-0173.pdf\">Geneva Conventions</a> are a set of treaties and protocols dictating the humane treatment of people during war. For example, they prohibit torture, hostage-taking, deportation and execution without &quot;judicial guarantees.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, the Conventions prescribe protections for various classes &mdash; the ill, medical workers, prisoners of war and civilians during wartime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main text of the Geneva Convention treaties does not include any specific mention of prohibited ammunition, and neither do the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/geneva_conventions\">supplementary protocols</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The closest thing to Moore&rsquo;s claim is Article 35 of the first protocol. It prohibits &quot;weapons, projectiles and materials &hellip; causing superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering&quot; but does not offer further clarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, the Geneva Convention does not apply to domestic weapon use, said Dan Joyner, a professor of law at the University of Alabama. Only wartime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;No source of international law prohibits the sale or use within a country of any particular kind of ammunition,&quot; Joyner said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mateen&rsquo;s declaration of allegiance to ISIS does give the incident an international character, but the Conventions primarily apply to issues between nation-factions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Different conventions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked at other international conventions to see if they banned certain ammunition. Some do, but experts suggested Mateen&rsquo;s ammunition might not qualify, again because these agreements are binding for traditional warfare, not domestic purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first appearance of an ammunition ban in international treaties comes in the 1868 <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Article.xsp?action=openDocument&amp;documentId=568842C2B90F4A29C12563CD0051547C\">Declaration of St. Petersburg</a>, which bans explosive or flammable projectiles weighing less than 400 grams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/dec99-03.asp\">Declaration III </a>of the 1899 <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/lawwar.asp\">Hague Convention</a> bans bullets that &quot;expand or flatten&quot; upon entering the body &mdash; commonly known as &quot;hollow-point bullets.&quot; The same language is included in the 1998 <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf\">Rome Statute</a> of the International Criminal Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The catch? Hague only applies &quot;in the case of war&quot; between two or more signatories. Rome only creates jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Case in point, the International Committee of the Red Cross <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule77\">notes</a> that many parties to the Hague Convention use &quot;expanding bullets&quot; in their domestic police forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gary Mauser, professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University, said Moore&rsquo;s claim errs in relating the Orlando shooting to the Convention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That ban does not apply to the attacker in Orlando since he was not part of a formal military force,&quot; Mauser said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its newly set International Small Arms Control Standards, the United Nations has recently included a <a href=\"http://www.smallarmsstandards.org/isacs/0330-en.pdf\">ban</a> on a <a href=\"http://www.smallarmsstandards.org/isacs/0120-en.pdf\">narrowly defined</a> type of armor-piercing ammunition. However, these protocols are only guidance for how countries could choose to behave domestically, Mauser said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;ISACS recommendations are merely recommendations, and do not have the force of law, either internationally or within any nation,&quot; said Mauser, who is also an ISACS expert advisor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The bullets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts are unsure whether Mateen&rsquo;s ammunition matches what the treaties describe anyway, as law enforcement officials have not yet released the exact type of bullet Mateen used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>George Mocsary, a professor of law at Southern Illinois University, said that the vast majority of AR-15 bullets (mentioned in Moore&rsquo;s tweet) are .223 &quot;full metal jackets.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These, Mocsary said, would not violate any conventions because they are &quot;not expanding,&quot; &quot;not explosive,&quot; and &quot;not armour-piercing by the ISACS definition.&quot; Mocsary did, however, note that many .223 rounds can penetrate some armour simply by nature of being shot from a rifle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, investigators have not confirmed whether &quot;full metal jackets&quot; were in fact what Mateen used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tim O&rsquo;Rourke, an investigator for The Grafton Group forensic science firm, said it is impossible to definitively characterize Mateen&rsquo;s rounds without further information. It is possible and legal to purchase hollow-point &quot;controlled expansion&quot; rounds in Florida, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding what Moore tweeted about the bullets&rsquo; &quot;spin,&quot; O&rsquo;Rourke noted it is possible for bullets to &quot;tumble&quot; in the body depending on contingent factors such as barrel length and distance fired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>O&rsquo;Rourke noted, however, that the bullets would not be designed to explode or detonate in the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, doctors treating the injuries <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/science/20160616_Doctors__High-velocity_Orlando_rifle_inflicts__quot_devastating_quot__wounds.html\">noted</a> the severe damage done to victim&rsquo;s bodies, such as &quot;big, giant cavities&quot; in the victims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One mentioned that bullets struck with such force that ripple effects damaged even nearby tissue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It actually puts kinetic energy into tissue that it didn&#39;t hit,&quot; said doctor John M. Porter in the Philadelphia Inquirer. &quot;It can go next to the liver and still destroy the liver.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moore tweeted that the Geneva Convention prohibits the type of ammunition used in the Orlando shooting. However, the Geneva Convention does not deal with ammunition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other international conventions do prohibit certain ammunition, but only during wartime, not domestically. Even if they were binding domestically, experts are not sure whether Mateen&rsquo;s bullets qualify, given the limited information released from law enforcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, Moore&rsquo;s tweet does emphasize the amount of damage these bullets inflicted. Even if his specifics might be off, doctors&rsquo; reports support Moore on the general point about damages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Moore&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c7d1cc63-b740-4c9e-ae93-d00188ad5e6a\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c7d1cc63-b740-4c9e-ae93-d00188ad5e6a</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-21T16:34:56.483236", "ruling_date": "2016-06-23T11:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore incorrectly claims AR-15 bullets banned by Geneva Convention", "ruling_headline_slug": "liberal-filmmaker-michael-moore-says-ar-15-bullets", "ruling_link_text": "Conventions not applicable domestically", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ATFHQ/status/742105007693156352\">official Twitter account</a>, &quot;Orlando guns,&quot; June 12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/06/13/weapons-used-in-nightclub-shooting-bought-at-ex-nypd-cops-gun-shop/\">New York Post</a>, &quot;Weapons used in nightclub shooting bought at ex-NYPD cop&rsquo;s gun shop,&quot; June 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>International Committee of the Red Cross, &quot;The <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/publications/icrc-002-0173.pdf\">Geneva Conventions </a>of 12 August 1949&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m3640104_IHL_SummaryGenevaConv.pdf\">American Red Cross</a>, &quot;Summary of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Their Additional Protocols,&quot; April 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yale Law School, &quot;Laws of War: <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/dec99-03.asp\">Declaration</a> on the Use of Bullets Which Expand or Flatten Easily in the Human Body; July 29, 1899&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf\">United Nations</a>, &quot;Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>International Committee of the Red Cross, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule77\">Practice</a> Relating to Rule 77.
