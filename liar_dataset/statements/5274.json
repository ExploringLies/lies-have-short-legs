They take more years to get through. Why? Because they have free money,&quot; Gingrich said. &quot;I would tell students: &lsquo;Get through as quick as you can. Borrow as little as you can. Have a part-time job.&rsquo; But that&rsquo;s very different from the culture that has grown up in the last 20 years.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe wondered whether the statistics showed that students are indeed taking longer to graduate than they did in the past.

On that score, he said, &quot;there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a whole lot to write home about.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSwanson did take issue with the general tenor of Gingrich&rsquo;s comments -- that you should borrow as little as you can and instead get a job if you want to increase the likelihood that you&rsquo;ll finish college on time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;That seems to fly in the face of what I think is a pretty well-established finding from the research that working during college or post-secondary education tends to be detrimental in terms of completion (that is, that you&rsquo;re less likely to complete) and time to completion (that it takes longer),&quot; Swanson said. &quot;There may be any number of issues and problems with excessive student borrowing, but being able to borrow for college does allow students the opportunity to focus more exclusively on their school work than would probably have been the case otherwise. If you follow the don&rsquo;t borrow/get a job argument and play that out a bit, that sounds a lot like what happens as a matter of course in community colleges. And the completion rates there are extremely low, on the order of one-third completing within an extended timeline.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nGingrich said that students today &quot;take more years to get through&quot; college. While graduation rates are lower than experts would like them to be, it&#39;s not true that students are taking longer to graduate from four-year institutions. The percentage graduating on time at four-year colleges has actually risen consistently in recent years. The only exception to this pattern is at two-year colleges, where the percentage of students graduating within three years has fallen slightly.
