Headlined, &quot;This is what liberalism will buy you,&quot; the meme features a photograph of a sign with removable letters, purportedly advertising a group called the Advancement of Islamic Agenda for America. The sign reads, &quot;Allah be praised. America we will kill you all and nothing you can do to stop it. Allah be praised.&quot; The meme concludes with the line, &quot;Still think they are kidding.&quot; (The question mark for that last sentence was mysteriously missing.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pretty scary sign if true. But is it? Hardly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We searched for a group called Advancement of Islamic Agenda for America on the Web and found no trace of it. More importantly, the sign comes from a template on the website <a href=\"http://www.says-it.com/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Church Sign Maker</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site allows people to create photos of church signs conveying any message they choose. The site allows users to <em>&quot;</em>create your own funny photos and graphics -- simply type in some text and choose from a few simple options. You can create your own church sign, make an official seal, have your own fire or police badge, and more.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this particular meme, the threat is a custom message that uses the site&rsquo;s &quot;<a href=\"http://www.says-it.com/churchsigns/classic5.php\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Classic Design #5</u></a>.&quot; The backgrounds of the template and the Facebook meme are identical. (<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/photos/signs/islamicagenda.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Snopes.com</u></a> has also debunked this claim.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some notable text on the main page of the Church Sign Maker page: &quot;Note: these church signs aren&#39;t real, they don&#39;t exist in the real world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meme claims that a sign in Dearborn, Mich., purportedly hung by a group called the Advancement of Islamic Agenda for America says, &quot;Allah be praised. America we will kill you all and nothing you can do to stop it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, nothing about this sign is true. It doesn&rsquo;t exist; it was created using a freely available web tool. We rate it Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-11-20T16:32:50.367393", "ruling_date": "2014-11-24T10:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Viral meme says Islamic group posted threat to kill Americans on sign in Dearborn, Mich.", "ruling_headline_slug": "viral-meme-says-islamic-group-posted-threat-kill-a", "ruling_link_text": "A fake created on a \"Church Sign Maker\" website", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Chain email submitted to PolitiFact by a reader</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/photos/signs/islamicagenda.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Islamic Agenda</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 21, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Church Sign Maker <a href=\"http://www.says-it.com/churchsigns/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>website</u></a>, accessed Nov. 20, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 14, "current_job": "Social media posting", "false_count": 18, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "", "id": 1486, "last_name": "Facebook posts", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "facebook-posts", "pants_count": 37, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Facebook_icon_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1486/", "total_count": 101, "true_count": 6, "website": "http://www.facebook.com/"}, "statement": "<p>A sign in Dearborn, Mich., for the Advancement of Islamic Agenda for America says, &quot;Allah be praised.
