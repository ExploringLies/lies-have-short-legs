As the Journal Sentinel explained, DPI raised expectations for performance to match those of a respected national exam.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe recalibration meant that essentially overnight, there was a large increase in the number of students who were rated as non-proficient -- even though their performance on the test didn&rsquo;t change.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStatewide, under the <a href=\"http://news.dpi.wi.gov/files/eis/pdf/dpinr2012_48.pdf\">old standard</a> for scoring the 2011 WKCE tests, 18 percent of students failed to score as proficient or advanced in reading.
