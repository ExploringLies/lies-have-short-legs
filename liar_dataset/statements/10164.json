Left to their own, Nicholas said, these nations have<strong> </strong>no chance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;These are lovely countries with friendly people and some heroic health workers, but roads, electricity and other infrastructure are desperately weak,&quot; Kristof&nbsp;said. &quot;All of Liberia can produce less than one-third as much electricity as the Dallas Cowboys football stadium consumes at peak times.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reader wondered about Kristof&rsquo;s claim, which essentially is: The country of Liberia cannot produce enough power to fuel one American football stadium at its peak demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, the Cowboys&nbsp;home field, AT&amp;T Stadium, is no small affair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The domed stadium seats 80,000 people, has the world&rsquo;s largest high-definition video screen (70 feet by 160 feet), and plenty of air conditioning to match the heat of a Texas autumn. It covers&nbsp;<a href=\"http://stadium.dallascowboys.com/assets/pdf/mediaArchitectureFactSheet.pdf\">73 acres</a>, cost <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=mosley_matt&amp;page=hotread1/mosley\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a reported $1.3 billion to build</u></a> and opened in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liberia, meanwhile, isn&rsquo;t the biggest country, but still, it has <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html?countryname=Liberia&amp;countrycode=li&amp;regionCode=afr&amp;rank=104#li\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>more than 4 million people</u></a>. Geography-wise, it&rsquo;s the 104th-largest country and about the size of Cuba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what do the facts say?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According the <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=li\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>U.S. Energy Information Service</u></a>, Liberia had installed capacity of 197 megawatts in 2011. The <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/li.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>CIA World Factbook</u></a> has the same figure. (For comparison, the United States has a capacity to generate more than 1 million megawatts.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means Liberia, at any one time, can generate 197 megawatts of&nbsp;electricity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how does 197 megawatts compare to peak demand at AT&amp;T Stadium? A rock solid answer proved to be elusive, but we found a reasonable estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would have clear figures&nbsp;if the Dallas Cowboys would say how much electricity the stadium uses at its&nbsp;peak. They refused. A spokesman told PunditFact, &quot;We don&rsquo;t give out those kinds of numbers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Oncor, the firm that installed the stadium&rsquo;s electric system provided a helpful clue. Oncor is a Texas electric company and <a href=\"http://www.oncor.com/en/pages/case-study-dallas-cowboy-stadium.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>on its website</u></a>, it boasts about the work its engineers and contractors did for the Cowboys. In that write-up, Oncor made this interesting comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The stadium, which is the largest domed stadium in the world, uses more power than most medium-sized cities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Oncor spokesman would tell us nothing more than that, but we turned to Douglas Gotham, director of the State Utility Forecasting Group at Purdue University&rsquo;s College of Engineering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gotham did some back-of-the-envelope math for us based on what we know about medium-sized U.S. cities. He chose<strong> </strong>Evansville, Ind., with a population of about 120,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The peak demand for the entire utility service area is about 1,500 megawatts,&quot; Gotham told us. &quot;About half of that roughly is in the city itself, so we&rsquo;re looking at about 750 megawatts at the peak.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Evansville being on the low end of medium-sized cities, Gotham said the comparison is close. If AT&amp;T Stadium can use&nbsp;at least 750 megawatts at its peak, that is more than&nbsp;three times what Liberia can produce -- if Oncor is right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The statement about Liberia is in the ballpark,&quot; Gotham said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found some other examples of medium-sized cities that bolster Gotham&#39;s estimate. Knoxville, Tenn., population 183,000, has a peak demand of 1,109&nbsp;megawatts. Huntsville, Ala., population 186,000, has a peak demand of 1,150 megawatts. Eugene, Ore., population 159,000, has a peak demand of 480 megawatts. Many factors such as location and the number of industrial users shape electricity consumption, but overall, the pattern reinforces Gotham&#39;s conclusion. (<a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/\">These cities</a> have&nbsp;municipal electric companies that mainly supply power within the city borders.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Some lingering data questions in Dallas</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s one other wrinkle to this comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kristof&rsquo;s <em>New York Times </em>article linked to a <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/09/13/what-uses-more-electricity-liberia-or-cowboys-stadium-on-game-day/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2013 </u><em><u>Wall Street Journal</u></em><u> piece</u></a> that discussed the comparison between Liberia and AT&amp;T stadium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal </em>cited the work of a utility analyst with the Bernstein Alliance asset management firm. The analyst, Bob Brackett, was intrigued when Liberian President&nbsp;Ellen Johnson Sirleaf made the comparison<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/08/29/let_s_power_africa_ellen_johnson_sirleaf_liberia_energy\" style=\"line-height: 20.7999992370605px; text-decoration: none;\"><u>in 2013</u></a>.&nbsp;So Brackett tried to run the numbers. He said<strong>&nbsp;</strong>peak demand at the stadium was 10 megawatts and that Liberia could generate less than a third of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both numbers seem to be way off.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;We reached Brackett&rsquo;s office but we never heard back from him to learn where he got his data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kristof said that Liberia can produce one-third as much electricity as the Cowboys stadium draws at its peak. U.S. government data shows that Liberia has nearly 200 megawatts of installed electricity capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The utility that worked on the stadium&rsquo;s electrical system said the facility used more power than most medium-sized cities. Using that benchmark, a utility expert from one the country&rsquo;s leading engineering schools concluded that peak demand at the stadium would fall in the range of 750 megawatts. That would mean that Liberia can produce less than one-third as much electricity as the Dallas&nbsp;football stadium consumes at peak times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exact figures are not available, but the basic comparison works. We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-30T12:53:16.302392", "ruling_date": "2014-10-30T14:32:09", "ruling_headline": "Kristof: Dallas Cowboys stadium draws 3 times more power than Liberia can produce", "ruling_headline_slug": "kristof-dallas-cowboys-stadium-draws-3-times-more-", "ruling_link_text": "It takes a lot of A/C to keep fans cool", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>New York Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/opinion/nicholas-kristof-how-to-defeat-ebola.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>How to defeat Ebola</u></a>, Oct. 22, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/09/13/what-uses-more-electricity-liberia-or-cowboys-stadium-on-game-day/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>What Uses More Electricity: Liberia, or Cowboys Stadium on Game Day?</u></a>, Sept. 13, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Foreign Policy</em>, <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/08/29/let_s_power_africa_ellen_johnson_sirleaf_liberia_energy\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Let&#39;s power Africa</u></a>, Aug. 29, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sports on Earth, <a href=\"http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/64441086/nfl-statistical-analysis-average-nfl-game\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>NFL by the numbers</u></a>, Dec. 10, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Green Building and Design, <a href=\"http://gbdmagazine.com/2012/dallas-cowboys/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Cowboys &amp; Engineers</u></a>, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy Electricity, <a href=\"http://www.energyelectricity.com/tag/dallas-cowboys-stadium-electricity-usage/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Energy Usage at Superbowl 45 in Dallas Texas</u></a>, Feb. 1, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Green Building Elements, <a href=\"http://greenbuildingelements.com/2013/02/14/guest-post-stadium-tech-and-making-green-giants/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Stadium Tech and Making Green Giants</u></a>, Feb. 14, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EE Times, <a href=\"http://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=7&amp;doc_id=1282252\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Cowboys new stadium a reminder of how to waste energy</u></a>, Aug. 18, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where&rsquo;s Chuck blog, <a href=\"http://wheres-chuck.blogspot.com/2010/05/dallas-cowboys-stadium-tour.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Dallas Cowboys Stadium Tour</u></a>, May 17, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Society of Civil Engineers, <a href=\"http://www.asce.org/uploadedFiles/News/CE_Magazine/0110Feature.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Super Span</u></a>, January, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Energy Information Service, <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_5_6_a\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&nbsp;Average Retail Price of Electricity to Ultimate Customers by End-Use Sector</u></a>, July 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Energy Information Service, <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=li\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Liberia</u></a>, May 30, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CIA World Factbook, <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/li.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Liberia</u></a>, &nbsp;2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Energy Information Administration, <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Electric power sales, revenue, and energy efficiency Form EIA-861 detailed data files </u></a>, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2011/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Cities and towns totals</u></a>, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Vrooman, Vanderbilt University, <a href=\"http://www.vanderbilt.edu/econ/faculty/Vrooman/cowboys-estimate.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Dallas Cowboys Stadium Analysis</u></a>, April 4, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oncor, <a href=\"http://www.oncor.com/en/pages/case-study-dallas-cowboy-stadium.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Dallas Cowboys Stadium</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modi Research Group, <a href=\"http://modi.mech.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/LiberiaEnergySectorReform_Phase4Report-Final_2013-08.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Liberia Power Sector &nbsp;Capacity Building and Energy Master Planning</u></a>, August, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photo,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://onemansblog.com/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>John P</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Vijay Modi, professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, Oct. 28, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Edwin Adkins, coordinator, Earth Engineering Center, Columbia University, Oct. 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Joe Trahan, media relations coordinator, Dallas Cowboys, Oct. 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Douglas J.
