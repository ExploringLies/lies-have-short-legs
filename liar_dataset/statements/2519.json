Scott Bruun, R-West Linn</a>, was the co-sponsor of a bill that would have installed a statewide cap-and-trade system for Oregon electric utilities. <a href=\"http://landru.leg.state.or.us/07reg/measures/hb3500.dir/hb3545.intro.html\">The</a><a href=\"http://landru.leg.state.or.us/07reg/measures/hb3500.dir/hb3545.intro.html\"> </a><a href=\"http://landru.leg.state.or.us/07reg/measures/hb3500.dir/hb3545.intro.html\">bill </a>had the two major hallmarks of most cap-and-trade legislation, according to Jon Isaacs, the executive director of the Oregon League of Conservation Voters: It set a limit on emissions and then established a system by which companies could trade credits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe bill didn&rsquo;t go anywhere, but a year later, in an ultimately successful effort to pick up the endorsement of the league, Bruun was happy to highlight his effort and pledged to give cap-and-trade another ago in the 2009 session. In fact, on the league&rsquo;s endorsement <a href=\"http://www.olcv.org/sites/default/files/HD%2037%20-%20Scott%20Bruun.pdf\">questionnaire </a>he listed it as the first of nine environmental issues he planned to highlight if re-elected to the Oregon House.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Rep. (Ben) Cannon and I were co-sponsors of cap and trade legislation in 2007,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I look forward to working hard for this in 2009. I have been studying the issue intensely and am even more convinced of its appropriateness.&quot; That answer alone, Isaacs said, was one of the primary reasons why the league ended up supporting Bruun&rsquo;s reelection to the Oregon House.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo years have passed since then, so what is Bruun saying these days -- you know, now that he&rsquo;s campaigning for national office?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Cap and trade will cause a major tax increase for everybody in American, and will export millions of United States jobs, and will do nothing to solve the&quot; problem of global warming, he said in February 2010 at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjmBHh1Io9s&amp;feature=player_embedded\">a </a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjmBHh1Io9s&amp;feature=player_embedded\">forum </a>in Salem hosted by The 9/12 Project Salem.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlee Lockman, Bruun&rsquo;s spokeswoman, says the congressional candidate wasn&rsquo;t happy with the national legislation, which was crafted on a largely partisan basis unlike the Oregon legislation. She also noted in an e-mail that Bruun has had a change of heart in terms of the effectiveness of cap and trade. &quot;Scott has found that the policy is flawed, and ultimately believes that the federal cap-and-trade policy is not effective.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s clear to PolitiFact Oregon that Bruun&rsquo;s views on the topic have changed pretty dramatically.
