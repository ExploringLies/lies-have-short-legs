In this item, we&rsquo;ll look at whether it&rsquo;s correct that &quot;a little less than 50 percent of the people in this country depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;re going to ignore Santorum&rsquo;s focus on what will happen within &quot;the next two years,&quot; since we don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball. But we think the most recent data can serve as a fair stand-in instead.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor that, we can use a table produced by the U.S. Census Bureau that offers data for the average number of Americans who received benefits from selected government programs during a three-month period between January and March 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe table includes such non-means-tested programs as Social Security, Medicare, unemployment compensation, veterans&#39; compensation, workers&#39; compensation, railroad retirement and veterans&#39; educational assistance. It also includes such means-tested programs as Medicaid, food stamps, the Women, Infants, and Children program, federal Supplemental Security Income, public or subsidized rental housing, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, free or reduced-price school breakfasts and lunches, energy assistance and other cash assistance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Census Bureau found that a little over 147 million Americans received payments from at least one of these programs at a time when the U.S. population was just over 303 million. This meant that 48.5 percent of Americans received federal cash or cash-like benefits -- and it means that Santorum&rsquo;s number is well-supported. In fact, counting such items as amounts refunded from the Earned Income Tax Credit or agricultural subsidies -- neither of which are included in these figures -- would push that number higher.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur colleague at the <em>Washington Post</em> Fact Checker <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/rick-santorums-latest-strangest-obamacare-claim/2012/03/07/gIQA1AE3xR_blog.html?wprss=rss_fact-checker\">concluded</a> that the usefulness of these numbers is weakened because they count everyone in a household as benefiting from a particular federal payment even if that payment is made in the name of only one person. We think that&#39;s a fair point, although we would add that if a couple and their two children live under the same roof as grandma, and she receives Social Security and Medicare, those federal benefits add to the resources available to the rest of the family. And if a child gets free school lunches, his parents will have more disposable income as a result.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe percentage of Americans &quot;who depend on some form of federal payment&quot; is indeed &quot;a little less than 50 percent,&quot; as Santorum said -- it was 48.5 percent in 2010. If anything, the<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/17/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-more-people-have-been-put-food-/\"> ongoing rise in usage of food stamps</a> and other federal assistance programs may have pushed this number higher, and adding in tax refunds from the Earned Income Tax Credit or agricultural subsidies could push the number higher still.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe number, however, includes every member of a household in which one member receives benefits, and in some households, it would be a stretch to say, as Santorum does, that as a result of that every member will &quot;depend on some form of federal payment.&quot; Discounting for that, we rate Santorum&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-07T17:14:25.083251", "ruling_date": "2012-03-08T11:31:36", "ruling_headline": "Rick Santorum says almost half of Americans receive federal benefits", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-santorum-says-almost-half-americans-receive-f", "ruling_link_text": "It may even be higher now", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRick Santorum, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/rick-santorums-super-tuesday-speech-full-transcript-video/2012/03/06/gIQAdPhrvR_blog.html\">Super Tuesday speech in Steubenville, Ohio</a>, Jan. 6, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/sipp/tables/quarterly-est/household-char/2010/1-qtr/table2.xls\">Table 2 -- People by Receipt of Benefits from Selected Programs: Monthly Averages</a>,&quot; First Quarter 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Henry Aaron, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, Mar. 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, Mar. 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Julia Isaacs, fellow at the Brookings Institution, Mar. 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview with Michael Wiseman, professor of economics and public policy, and Theresa Anderson, research assistant, George Washington University Institute of Public Policy, Mar. 7, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 12, "current_job": "", "false_count": 17, "first_name": "Rick", "half_true_count": 14, "home_state": "Pennsylvania", "id": 1077, "last_name": "Santorum", "mostly_true_count": 7, "name_slug": "rick-santorum", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Rick_Santorum_2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1077/", "total_count": 61, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;A little less than 50 percent of the people in this country depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign speech in Steubenville, Ohio", "statement_date": "2012-03-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 127, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/127/", "subject": "Children", "subject_slug": "children", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 119, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/119/", "subject": "Families", "subject_slug": "families", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 33, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/33/", "subject": "Federal Budget", "subject_slug": "federal-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 212, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/212/", "subject": "Medicaid", "subject_slug": "medicaid", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/", "/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 50, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/50/", "subject": "Medicare", "subject_slug": "medicare", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 141, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/141/", "subject": "Social Security", "subject_slug": "social-security", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 51, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/51/", "subject": "Veterans", "subject_slug": "veterans", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
