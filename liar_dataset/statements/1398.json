Rick Perry accused Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of supporting sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Senator,&quot; he said, &quot;you voted for sanctuary cities.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHutchison said the charge was &quot;absolutely wrong.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWho&#39;s right? We decided to check the vote.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry&#39;s campaign pointed us to the proposed Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007. Hutchison voted against an amendment by Sen. Tom Coburn, R.-Okla., to enforce existing border security and immigration laws before granting illegal immigrants amnesty. (The bill itself never passed the Senate.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFrom a press release Coburn issued, the amendment would have required enforcement of &quot;existing border security and immigration laws before amnesty can be granted to illegal immigrants. These provisions of existing law include: control over maritime borders, full fencing required by law, integrated alien databases, US-VISIT program, biometric ID system, and ending &#39;sanctuary city&#39; policies.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tA 1996 provision in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act requires states and localities to pass along someone&#39;s immigration and citizenship status on request from any government entity. Coburn&#39;s amendment tried to insure it would be enforced.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFrom a 2006 report by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan agency that provides analysis to Congress: &quot;Most cities that are considered sanctuary cities have adopted a &#39;don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&#39; policy under which they don&#39;t require their employees, including law enforcement officers, to report immigrants who may be illegally present in the country.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Senate rejected the amendment 54-42. Hutchison&#39;s campaign said she voted against it because it also prevented local input on the location of a border fence &mdash; a project widely opposed in the Rio Grande Valley.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;I must protect my constituents,&quot; Hutchison said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. Border fence decisions belonged to the Border Patrol, &quot;not the Congress, most of whom have never visited Laredo, Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Secure Fence Act of 2006, which Hutchison voted for, extended reinforced fencing and other barriers, roads, cameras and sensors, along 700 miles of the southern border.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHutchison said that she agreed with with the &quot;purpose&quot; of Coburn&#39;s amendment but objected to what she said it would have allowed: government disregard for the opinion of private property owners and cities on the Rio Grande who would be affected by the fence.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut by voting to kill the amendment, was she also voting in favor of sanctuary cities?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe found no evidence that Coburn considered opposition to his amendment as support for sanctuary cities.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCoburn&#39;s amendment would have reaffirmed established border and immigration policies. From all evidence, there&rsquo;s no reasonable way to conclude that Hutchison&rsquo;s vote against the amendment was a vote in favor of sanctuary cities.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry&#39;s spinning the facts.
