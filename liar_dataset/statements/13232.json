Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he&#39;s done to women. There&#39;s never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that&#39;s been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump continued: &quot;Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she&#39;s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The alleged rape of a 12-year-old had nothing to do with Bill Clinton. Trump was suddenly, and without explanation, shifting gears to Hillary Clinton&#39;s successful defense of the alleged rapist after she was reluctantly assigned to the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s the part of Trump&#39;s claim we&#39;ll fact-check here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, Clinton, 27, was working at a University of Arkansas legal aid clinic. The accused man was indigent and specifically asked for a woman to represent him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He ultimately pleaded guilty to unlawful fondling of a minor, receiving a year in jail and four years&#39; probation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked the Trump campaign about the allegations, a spokesman referred us to <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/politics/the-hillary-tapes/\">a July 15, 2014, article</a> in the conservative Washington Free Beacon, which uncovered audio recordings of Clinton, although it&#39;s not clear when the recordings were made. The Beacon says they date from 1983 to 1987.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the tapes, she calls it a &quot;terrible case&quot; and &quot;a fascinating case,&quot; for reasons that will become clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article notes that she can be heard laughing at several points on the tape, but it doesn&#39;t say she was laughing at the victim, as Trump claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She is &quot;discussing the crime lab&rsquo;s accidental destruction of DNA evidence that tied (the accused man, Thomas Alfred) Taylor to the crime,&quot; destruction that led the prosecution to seek a plea deal on a lesser charge, according to the article.&nbsp;\u200b(For the record, DNA testing as we know it was years away, but labs did determine blood type in criminal cases in that era.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I plea bargained it down because it turned out they didn&#39;t have any evidence,&quot; Clinton says. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/e2f13f2awK4\">In the tape</a>, available on YouTube, Clinton says of the case, &quot;It&#39;s sad.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;But you know what was sad about it was that the prosecutor had evidence,&quot; Clinton says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, she recounts that the crime lab had taken a key piece of evidence &mdash; the accused man&#39;s underpants, which had blood on it &mdash; neatly cut out a piece, and then threw that piece away once testing was done, eliminating the ability to do independent testing. In this case, it&#39;s the interviewer, Arkansas journalist Roy Reed, who can be heard laughing, not Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the tape, in which Reed laughs a few more times at her story, Clinton can be heard chortling when she reports that the prosecutor didn&#39;t want her to see the underwear before it was presented at trial. Defense attorneys have the right to see all the evidence first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when the judge is considering the plea deal, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/e2f13f2awK4?t=5m22s\">Clinton recounts</a> that the judge wanted her to leave the room while he talked to the accused man. Clinton says she told the judge, &quot;Judge, I can&#39;t leave the room. I&#39;m his lawyer.&quot; The judge reportedly responded, &quot;I know, but I don&#39;t want to talk about this in front of you.&quot; Again, Reed can be heard laughing after saying, &quot;Oh God. Really?&quot; It&#39;s not clear if Clinton is laughing as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/e2f13f2awK4?t=1m49s\">At another point</a>, Clinton says of the accused man, &quot;I had him take a polygraph, which he passed &mdash; which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.&quot; She and the reporter laugh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And she laughs when she recalls telling the prosecution that she was prepared to bring in a top expert witness to testify &quot;to prevent this miscarriage of justice.&quot; The reporter laughs as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It should be noted that it&#39;s clear from the record that Clinton aggressively defended the man and did file motions questioning the victim&#39;s credibility. But there is no evidence, including this audio tape, that Clinton or Reed were laughing at the victim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump said after Clinton helped a man accused of raping a 12-year-old, &quot;she&#39;s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump is referring to an audio tape in which she does respond with amusement at her recollections of the oddities of the case, which involve the prosecution and the judge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At no point does she laugh at the victim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CORRECTION, Oct. 18, 2016: </strong>This story was amended to note that the blood test referenced in the Washington Free Beacon story could not have been a true DNA match test.&nbsp;That technology was not available in 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-09T23:28:09.104708", "ruling_date": "2016-10-10T00:49:26", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump wrongly says Hillary Clinton laughed at a 12-year-old rape victim", "ruling_headline_slug": "trump-says-clinton-laughed-about-rape-case", "ruling_link_text": "There's laughter, but not at the girl", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Email, Steven Cheung, Donald Trump campaign, Oct. 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails, Josh Schwerin, Hillary Clinton campaign, Oct. 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DonaldJTrump.com, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/hillary-attacks-credibility-of-12-year-old-rape-victim-laughs\">Hillary Attacks Credibility of 12-Year-Old Rape Victim, Laughs</a>,&quot; Oct. 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Free Beacon, &quot;<a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/politics/the-hillary-tapes/\">The Hillary Tapes</a>,&quot; June 15, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YouTube, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2f13f2awK4\">The Hillary Clinton Tapes</a>,&quot; Washington Free Beacon channel, June 15, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/19/did-clinton-laugh-about-a-rapists-light-sentence-and-attack-sexual-harassment-victims/\">Did Clinton laugh about a rapist&#39;s light sentence and attack sexual harassment victims?</a>&quot; May 19, 2016 and &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/09/everything-that-was-said-at-the-second-donald-trump-vs-hillary-clinton-debate-highlighted/\">Everything that was said at the second Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton debate, highlighted</a>,&quot; Oct. 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2014/jul/17/did-hillary-clinton-ask-be-relieved-rapist/\">Did Hillary Clinton ask to be &#39;relieved&#39; from representing an accused rapist in 1970s?</a>&quot; July 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newsday, &quot;Election 2008: For Young Clinton, a Case of Clashing Ideals,&quot; Feb. 24, 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-freed-child-rapist-laughed-about-it/\">Hillary Clinton Freed Child Rapist,</a>&quot; Aug. 13, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says after Hillary Clinton helped a man accused of raping a 12-year-old, &quot;she&#39;s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "the second 2016 presidential debate", "statement_date": "2016-10-09", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>We strive to make our work completely accurate.
