The sequence starts by Christie downplaying on each show claims of a presidential run in 2016 and instead focusing on his being New Jersey&rsquo;s governor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To illustrate that point, the clips then lead into Christie saying the state has gained &quot;143,000 new&nbsp; private-sector jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christie&rsquo;s number is generally accurate, but the methodology used to measure the jobs gains isn&rsquo;t exactly ideal, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christie&rsquo;s timeframe for measuring jobs was February 2010 -- his first full month in office -- to August 2013, the most recent month for which preliminary employment data is available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Jersey had 3,192,000 private-sector jobs in February 2010, BLS data shows. By August 2013 that figure was 3,334,400. The difference? 142,400 jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Christie rounded up a bit when he cited a gain of 143,000 jobs, but his number is generally solid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those numbers also match employment data on the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, the methodology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The timeframe cited by Christie isn&rsquo;t even. Experts have told PolitiFact New Jersey on numerous occasions that the best way to evaluate employment trends is to measure seasonally adjusted, year-over-year data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seasonally adjusted data is best for review because it takes into account jobs that result from seasonal hiring patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when looking at annual data, we often review December over December to get the most accurate picture of employment for that 12-month period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in Christie&rsquo;s case, we&rsquo;re evaluating February 2010 over preliminary data for August 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joseph Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, agreed that it&rsquo;s best to review seasonally adjusted data within the context of a year. He reviewed the BLS numbers from August 2012 to August 2013 and then looked at how New Jersey&rsquo;s job growth compares with neighboring states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seneca&rsquo;s analysis found that nearly half the state&rsquo;s private-sector job growth came during the year that he reviewed: 60,300 private-sector jobs. In addition, New Jersey&rsquo;s job growth rate of 1.8 percent exceeded that of New York and Connecticut, both with 1.3 percent growth, and Pennsylvania, which had a growth rate of 0.9 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The latest year-over-year data indicate that New Jersey is right in the middle of the pack in terms of the rate of private-sector job growth,&quot; Seneca said in an e-mail, adding that much of the growth has been in education, health services, leisure and hospitality, trade, transportation and utilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent segment on The Colbert Report shows Christie emphasizing his work as governor by saying New Jersey has gained &quot;143,000 new private-sector jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BLS data and an analysis by a Rutgers economics professor back up Christie&rsquo;s figure, which is rounded up a bit from the actual figure of 142,400 new private-sector jobs created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The governor&rsquo;s overall point is that private-sector employment in New Jersey is increasing, and he&rsquo;s right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement True.
