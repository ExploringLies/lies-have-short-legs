Frontrunner Donald Trump and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker got into verbal tussle over who had a worse fiscal track record. Walker charged that Trump had taken four projects into bankruptcy. Trump fired back that Walker had ruined his state&rsquo;s budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You were supposed to make a billion dollars in the state,&quot; Trump said. &quot;You lost 2.2 (billion). You have, right now, a huge budget deficit. That&rsquo;s not a Democratic point. That&#39;s a point. That&rsquo;s a fact.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump is partly right on the money, but he&rsquo;s mixing apples and oranges, and his use of the word deficit is problematic. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-under-scott-walker-wisconsin-bud/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>PolitiFact Wisconsin</u></a> covered much of the ground before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The rules</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By law, Wisconsin&rsquo;s two-year budgets must be balanced -- revenue equalling expenditures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, unlike the federal government, Wisconsin can never run an actual budget deficit by borrowing money that piles up as debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, the state does various projections of what revenues and expenditures will be for the upcoming two-year budget cycle. Those projections can show a surplus or a deficit -- although &quot;deficit&quot; is more accurately termed a projected shortfall, since there is no actual red ink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the two figures he cited were projections that received plenty of attention when they were made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The two figures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January 2014, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau projected Wisconsin would see a surplus of <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/Revenue-Estimates/Documents/2014_01_16_Revenue%20estimates.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>about $1 billion</u></a> by June 30, 2015 -- the end of the 2013-15 budget cycle. At the time, revenues were coming in higher than expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker and the GOP-run Legislature adopted a series of tax cuts later in 2014, making good on a Walker promise to return such surpluses to taxpayers, but drawing criticism for not using the money for other purposes, such as <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinbudgetproject.org/of-a-surplus-of-nearly-1-billion-not-a-dime-is-going-to-the-rainy-day-fund\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>boosting</u></a> the state&rsquo;s rainy day fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the way, however, tax collections grew at a slower pace than had been projected. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By November 2014, there was a reversal of fortune: Walker&rsquo;s own Department of Administration projected a <a href=\"http://doa.wi.gov/Documents/DEBF/Budget/Biennial%20Budget/November20Report.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$2.2 billion</u></a> shortfall for 2015-17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, that figure was not an actual deficit. Indeed, even as a projected shortfall it was overstated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s because the standard for projections made in the months leading up to the next budget cycle is to include all the funding requests made by state agencies -- even though, in reality, those requests always get trimmed. That serves to temporarily inflate the actual picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, the 2015-17 budget approved by the Legislature and signed by Walker in July 2015 was balanced -- just as every other Wisconsin state budget is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mixing apples and oranges, Trump said that under Walker, &quot;You were supposed to make a billion dollars in the state. You lost 2.2 (billion). You have right now a huge budget deficit. That&rsquo;s not a Democratic point. That&#39;s a point. That&rsquo;s a fact.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was in early 2014 a projection of a $1 billion surplus heading into the 2015-17 budget period. Late in 2014, there was a projection of a $2.2 billion shortfall -- the difference between expected revenues and the amount of money being requested by state agencies. But the shortfall was never a deficit -- and some of the surplus was consciously spent by Republicans, as tax cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-09-16T20:39:50.405376", "ruling_date": "2015-09-16T20:39:13", "ruling_headline": "Trump: Walker turned a $1 billion surplus into a $2.2 budget shortfall", "ruling_headline_slug": "trump-walker-turned-1-billion-surplus-22-budget-sh", "ruling_link_text": "Repeats a debunked claim", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CNN, Republican presidential debate, Sept. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact-Wisconsin,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-under-scott-walker-wisconsin-bud/\">Donald Trump says that under Scott Walker, Wisconsin budget went from projected surplus to a deficit</a>, July 28, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Wisconsin Gov.
