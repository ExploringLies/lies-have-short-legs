Cheating took place at some 40 schools, she said, but an investigative report on the scandal implicated only a small percentage of the district&rsquo;s educators. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;95 percent of the teachers and the principals are not implicated in the report at all,&quot; Franklin told reporter Jennifer Leslie on Saturday. &quot;There are 3,000 teachers and principals, and this report says that about 5 percent were involved in this.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnly 5 percent? What about investigators&rsquo; conclusion that the cheating was &quot;widespread&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Georgia hunted for answers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report, released July 5, found that cheating took place on the Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests, or CRCT, a set of standardized tests administered across Georgia. Typically given in first through eighth grade, they&rsquo;re designed to determine how well students meet state curriculum standards.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report implicated 178 educators, including 38 principals, in the cheating scandal. Investigators confirmed cheating in 44 of 56 schools they examined. Time magazine called it &quot;likely the largest cheating scandal in U.S. history to date.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted Franklin, who told us in a voice mail that the numbers she used in the TV interview were from news accounts, but did not give specifics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Truth-O-Meter soldiered on. PolitiFact Georgia used an internal Atlanta Journal-Constitution database, state and federal data, and information from APS&rsquo; website to check Franklin&rsquo;s claim. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the AJC&rsquo;s database and state and federal figures, there are some 4,000 educators in the district, which means that about 5 percent of the district&rsquo;s educators were implicated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFranklin&rsquo;s arithmetic is correct, but we noticed some holes in her approach. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFranklin&rsquo;s calculation includes high school educators, but the CRCT is given only to students in grades 1 through 8. Also, Franklin&rsquo;s number lumps teachers with principals and does not consider the number of schools involved.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe took these factors into account and made our own calculations. They led us to very different conclusions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCheating may have been limited among the rank and file, but the numbers show it was commonplace among school leadership.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome 2,370 teachers handle students in grades 1 through 8, according to AJC&rsquo;s database. The report implicated 140 of them, or about 6 percent. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrincipals are a different story. A recent APS list shows 70 of them at the district&rsquo;s elementary and middle schools. Thirty-eight of them were implicated, or 54 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInvestigators found cheating in 44 out of 70 elementary and middle schools, which amounts to 63 percent. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s also worth noting that a top cheating investigator warned Monday that the true percentage of educators involved is very likely higher than the numbers in the report suggest. A &quot;wall of silence&quot; among school employees made it difficult to identify all of those involved, former Attorney General Mike Bowers said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis news makes Franklin&rsquo;s claim that only a small percent of educators were implicated &quot;at all&quot; appear too clear-cut.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, how do we rule?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe arithmetic behind the number Franklin uses in her claim that &quot;95 percent of teachers and principals are not implicated . . . at all&quot; is accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the impression she gives -- that if you put the cheating in perspective, only a small percent of the district is tainted -- ignores crucial context. More than half of the district&rsquo;s middle and elementary school principals were implicated, and cheating took place at nearly two-thirds of APS schools.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese percentages may be lower than the true number of cheaters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFranklin cherry-picked a number that supported her point, leaving out important details and taking things out of context. Her claim therefore meets PolitiFact&rsquo;s definition of Half True.&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-07-14T15:28:34.401947", "ruling_date": "2011-07-15T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Ex-Mayor Franklin says small percent of educators named in APS cheating", "ruling_headline_slug": "ex-mayor-franklin-says-small-percent-educators-nam", "ruling_link_text": "Number is right, context is wrong", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tWXIA 11 Alive, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.11alive.com/news/article/197230/40/Exclusive-Former-Mayor-Franklin-on-APS-Cheating\">Exclusive: Former Mayor Franklin on APS Cheating</a>,&quot; July 9, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia Department of Education, <a href=\"http://www.gadoe.org/ReportingFW.aspx?PageReq=102&amp;CountyId=761&amp;T=1&amp;FY=2010\">Atlanta Public Schools 2009-2010 report card</a>, accessed July 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAtlanta Public Schools, <a href=\"http://www.atlanta.k12.ga.us/1861101111144426170/FileLib/browse.asp?A=374&amp;BMDRN=2000&amp;BCOB=0&amp;C=55459\">list of schools</a>, accessed July 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/four-aps-superintendents-removed-1010740.html\">Four APS superintendents removed in scandal fallout</a>&quot; July 11, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, internal Atlanta Public Schools database, accessed July 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAtlanta Public Schools <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/volume-1volume-1-of-special-1000798.html\">cheating investigation</a>, June 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia Department of Education, <a href=\"http://www.gadoe.org/ReportingFW.aspx?PageReq=102&amp;CountyId=761&amp;T=1&amp;FY=2010\">Atlanta Public Schools report card, 2009-2010</a>, accessed July 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/districtsearch/district_detail.asp?Search=1&amp;InstName=Atlanta+Public+Schools&amp;DistrictType=1&amp;DistrictType=2&amp;DistrictType=3&amp;DistrictType=4&amp;DistrictType=5&amp;DistrictType=6&amp;DistrictType=7&amp;NumOfStudentsRange=more&amp;NumOfSchoolsRange=more&amp;ID2=1300120&amp;details=2\">Atlanta Public Schools district details</a>, July 12, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmails, voice mail, former Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin, July 11, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Shirley", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 1330, "last_name": "Franklin", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "shirley-franklin", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Franklin_Shriley.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1330/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;95 percent of teachers and principals are not implicated in the [Atlanta Public Schools cheating scandal] report at all.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "a television interview", "statement_date": "2011-07-09", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Shirley Franklin says % of cheating #APS educators is small.
