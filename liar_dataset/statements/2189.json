Forget the fact that <em>two</em> Hawaiian newspapers published notices of his birth from 1961. <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/04/cnn-poll-quarter-doubt-president-was-born-in-u-s/?npt=NP1\" id=\"u0r3\" title=\"A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll\">A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll</a> released Aug. 4, on Obama&#39;s 49th birthday, found that 27 percent of Americans still think Barack Obama was probably or definitely not born in the United States.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo what should we make of an e-mail that sends readers to a YouTube video in which Obama blandly states that he was born in Kenya?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Obama admits he is not a citizen -- read before this is pulled,&quot; the e-mail says. &quot;Unbelievable!!!!!&quot; &quot;Why has he not been impeached?&quot; &quot;The amazing part of this travesty is Americans continue allowing themselves to be ruled by an illegal alien.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 11-minute video, which has been online since May 2, is titled <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwhKuunp8D8\" id=\"ef6l\" title=\"&quot;Not Natural Born -- TRUTH MATTERS,&quot;\">&quot;Not Natural Born -- TRUTH MATTERS.&quot;</a> It starts with a 30-second clip of Obama speaking before a group of adults. It begins in mid-sentence: &quot; . . . that maybe I&#39;m not an American citizen. Some people said he has a forged birth certificate. Well, first of all, it&#39;s true I&#39;m not an American. I was not born in Hawaii. I wasn&#39;t born in the United States of America. I come from Kenya.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you listen closely, you can hear bad editing. The volume and sound quality of his voice change at key points, such as between &quot;it&#39;s true I&#39;m not&quot; and &quot;an American.&quot; The video never shows his lips where he makes his key admissions, so you can&#39;t see if his lips are in sync with what he&#39;s saying. And his audience offers no reaction to what should be a stunning admission.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo where did that portion of the video come from? The logo at the bottom of the video reads obamasnippets.com, which takes you to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/ObamaSnippetsDotCom\" id=\"bjoh\" title=\"a YouTube humor\">a YouTube humor</a> channel that features seven videos in which Obama&#39;s words have been edited for laughs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne example is the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh0ib0bSj-o\" id=\"q70f\" title=\"&quot;Obama DRUNK!&quot;\">&quot;Obama DRUNK!&quot;</a> video, where his comments have been slowed to make it sound as if he&#39;s intoxicated and hitting on an audience member.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe YouTube channel makes the intent clear: &quot;This is not &#39;political.&#39; This is just for fun. This is not an &#39;Anti-Obama&#39; site. This is not a &#39;Pro-Obama&#39; site. This is an &#39;Obama Humor&#39; site. . . . All Snippets made with 100% Obama&#39;s voice. No imitations! (That would be too easy.)&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe video in which Obama is heard saying &quot;I&#39;m not an American,&quot; called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJUxsFBwcbs\" id=\"vei_\" title=\"&quot;Birthers' Delight - Part 1,&quot;\">&quot;Birthers&#39; Delight - Part 1,&quot;</a> includes a disclaimer indicating that it&#39;s a spoof.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe &quot;Truth Matters&quot; video has stripped away the disclaimer and added background music, perhaps in an attempt to disguise the telltale signs of editing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere&#39;s one other indication that the Obama &quot;confession&quot; is a hoax. Some anti-Obama sites that have posted the video have included a description beginning, &quot;This video starts out with some content from obamasnippets.com, which, of course is contrived.&quot; But on the YouTube page, the word &quot;contrived&quot; is not visible, unless a viewer opens the full description box.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, nothing in the video itself warns viewers that the Obama clip is fabricated and the video includes <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/phone.asp\" id=\"zbgu\" title=\"a photo\">a photo</a> -- proven fake more than a year ago by our friends at Snopes.com -- of Obama holding a landline telephone receiver upside down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy Aug. 4, 2010, the Truth Matters video had been viewed over a million times on YouTube, 176 times more often than the original ObamaSnippets.com video, where its humorous nature is clear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTruth does matter, but not to the makers of the Truth Matters video or to the creators of the &quot;Obama admits&quot; e-mail. We rate them both as Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/27b5599a-0629-4b38-a5e5-67d74dc36f83\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/27b5599a-0629-4b38-a5e5-67d74dc36f83</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-05T18:14:35.467164", "ruling_date": "2010-08-05T18:19:37", "ruling_headline": "YouTube video purporting to show Obama admitting he is not a U.S. citizen far from the truth", "ruling_headline_slug": "e-mail-sends-readers-youtube-video-where-obama-adm", "ruling_link_text": "Is that Elvis in the audience?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CNN.com, <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/04/cnn-poll-quarter-doubt-president-was-born-in-u-s/?npt=NP1\" id=\"y_en\" title=\"&quot;CNN Poll: A quarter doubt Obama was born in the U.S.,&quot;\">&quot;CNN Poll: Quarter doubt Obama was born in U.S.,&quot;</a> accessed Aug. 5, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nE-mail, &quot;Obama admits he is not a citizen - read before this is pulled,&quot; accessed Aug. 3, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYouTube video, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwhKuunp8D8\" id=\"mi-u\" title=\"&quot;Not Natural Born -- TRUTH MATTERS,&quot;\">&quot;Not Natural Born -- TRUTH MATTERS,&quot;</a> accessed Aug. 3, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYouTube channel, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/ObamaSnippetsDotCom\" id=\"w4n.\" title=\"ObamaSnippetsDotCom\">ObamaSnippetsDotCom</a>, accessed Aug. 3, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSnopes.com, <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/phone.asp\" id=\"svjp\" title=\"&quot;Telephony,&quot;\">&quot;Telephony,&quot;</a> accessed Aug. 3, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Fake_news", "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "", "false_count": 44, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "", "id": 27, "last_name": "Chain email", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "chain-email", "pants_count": 106, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-emailer.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/27/", "total_count": 180, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Obama admits he is not a citizen.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "referring to a YouTube video", "statement_date": "2010-08-03", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 167, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/167/", "subject": "Obama Birth Certificate", "subject_slug": "obama-birth-certificate", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/1/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
