Scott Walker brought the story of Megan Sampson, the first-year teacher who in 2010 lost her job in the Milwaukee Public Schools, back into the news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s Walker critics who are keeping it there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Jan. 24, 2015 appearance at an early 2016 presidential event in Iowa, Walker told the audience Sampson -- the &quot;outstanding teacher of the year in my state&quot; -- lost her job because of seniority provisions in the school district&rsquo;s contract with the teachers&rsquo; union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(We rated that claim <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/16/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsins-teacher-year-was-/\">Half True</a>: Sampson was laid off under the provisions of the contract, but her award was for first-year English teachers in the district, not all teachers.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/14/opinion/gail-collins-scott-walker-needs-an-eraser.html?smid=fb-share&amp;_r=0\">Feb. 15, 2015 column titled &quot;Scott Walker needs an eraser&quot;</a>, Gail Collins of the New York Times cited the story in criticizing Walker&rsquo;s education policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One problem: The calendar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the piece, Collins noted Walker&rsquo;s mistake in calling Sampson teacher of the year and wrote:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All of that came as a distinct surprise to Claudia Felske, a member of the faculty at East Troy High School who actually was named a Wisconsin Teacher of the Year in 2010. In a phone interview, Felske said she still remembers when she got the news at a &lsquo;surprise pep assembly at my school.&rsquo; As well as the fact that those layoffs happened because Walker cut state aid to education.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last part caught our attention -- and <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/nyt-columnist-blames-scott-walker-teacher-layoffs-occurred-he-was-governor_852171.html\">that of others as well</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, Walker&rsquo;s policies had nothing to do with Sampson&rsquo;s layoff in 2010. At the time, he was in the midst of his successful campaign, but did not take office until January 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather, MPS laid off a total of 482 teachers in June 2010 in response to a severe budget shortfall, in part tied to declining enrollment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collins didn&rsquo;t respond to an email, but the Times posted a correction Feb. 15, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;An earlier version of this column incorrectly stated that teacher layoffs in Milwaukee in 2010 happened because Gov. Scott Walker &quot;cut state aid to education.&quot; The layoffs were made by the city&rsquo;s school system because of a budget shortfall, before Mr. Walker took office in 2011,&quot; the correction said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collins said Gov. Scott Walker&rsquo;s policies were to blame for Milwaukee Public Schools teacher Megan Sampson being laid off. But Sampson lost her job in June 2010, six months before Walker took office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>------</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>More on Scott Walker</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-290106981.html\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#39;s Scott Walker page</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-02-17T12:00:15.074372", "ruling_date": "2015-02-17T11:14:52", "ruling_headline": "Columnist Gail Collins blames Gov.
