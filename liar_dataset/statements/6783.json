The kicker: an accusation that Obama puts an atheistic spin on the Declaration of Independence. Obama, it says, is the &quot;only president in history who has deliberately removed the words &lsquo;endowed by their Creator&rsquo; when referring to the Declaration of Independence not once but several times.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst, a quick American history review. The <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html\">Declaration of Independence</a> was adopted on July 4, 1776, in Philadelphia, proclaiming America&rsquo;s separation from the British empire and asserting the right to govern itself. Here&rsquo;s the most famous line, and the one at issue:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPresidents and politicians often cite that line to stir the passions of voters. But is Obama unique among presidents in skipping the religious reference?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndeed, we did find <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR61uTGTFoM\">video</a> of Obama paraphrasing the line and leaving out the &quot;Creator.&quot;<br />\r\nAt the 2010 Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute awards gala, he said it as, &quot;we hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, endowed with certain inalienable rights, life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeveral <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/stories/obama-continues-to-omit-creator-from-declaration-of-independence/\">conservative</a> <a href=\"http://cnsnews.com/news/article/obama-omits-creator-when-citing-inalienable-rights-lgbts\">websites</a> appear to be tracking his omissions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut there&rsquo;s also video evidence of Obama saying &quot;their Creator&quot; when citing the Declaration. The blog of the liberal group People for the American Way even put together <a href=\"http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/how-many-times-does-obama-have-say-endowed-their-creator-right-will-stop-lying\">a compilation video</a> of Obama reciting the line verbatim.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut Obama&#39;s not &quot;the only president in history&quot; who has done it. A website that investigates urban legends <a href=\"http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/barackobama/a/Obama-Omits-By-Their-Creator.htm\">dug up examples</a> of Calvin Coolidge, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan omitting the &quot;Creator.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nGING-PAC&rsquo;s ad says Obama is &quot;the only president in history who has deliberately removed the words.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot so. It&rsquo;s true that Obama has omitted &quot;endowed by their Creator&quot; in speeches, but he&rsquo;s also included those words many times. And at least three other presidents -- including Ronald Reagan -- have left out the Creator.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-27T13:10:47.289617", "ruling_date": "2012-09-27T13:10:18", "ruling_headline": "Ad says Obama leaves 'Creator' out of Declaration", "ruling_headline_slug": "ad-says-obama-leaves-creator-out-declaration", "ruling_link_text": "Plenty of times, he mentions the line", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://www.gingpac.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/GINGadFinal.pdf\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.73493393678608\">GING-PAC newspaper ad</a>, September 2012<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\nGING-PAC website, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.gingpac.org/obama4andout\">Campaign to save America from Barack Hussein Obama</a>,&quot; accessed Sept. 25 &amp; 26, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/sep/26/pacs-newspaper-ad-filled-falsehoods/\">PAC&#39;s newspaper ad filled with falsehoods</a>,&quot; Sept. 26, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html\">Declaration of Independence</a>, July 4, 1776<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYouTube, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR61uTGTFoM\">Obama Leaves &quot;By their Creator&quot; Out of Declaration of Independence at Hispanic Caucus Speech</a>,&quot; Sept. 18, 2010<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRightWingWatch.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/how-many-times-does-obama-have-say-endowed-their-creator-right-will-stop-lying\">How Many Times Does Obama Have to Say &#39;Endowed by Their Creator&#39; Before the Right Will Stop Lying?</a>&quot; Aug. 9, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUrbanLegends.About.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/barackobama/a/Obama-Omits-By-Their-Creator.htm\">Email: Obama Omits &#39;Creator&#39; in Declaration Quote</a>,&quot; accessed Sept. 27, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 2033, "last_name": "Government is Not God PAC", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "government-not-god-pac", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Government_Is_Not_God.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2033/", "total_count": 6, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.gingpac.org/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Obama is only president in history who has deliberately removed the words &quot;endowed by their Creator&quot; when referring to the Declaration of Independence.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a newspaper ad", "statement_date": "2012-09-23", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 42, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/42/", "subject": "History", "subject_slug": "history", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 219, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/219/", "subject": "Message Machine 2012", "subject_slug": "message-machine-2012", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/", "/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
