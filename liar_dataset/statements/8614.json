Whether it should stay that way, be reduced or even abolished, is being examined by the Special Joint Legislative Commission to Study the Sales Tax Repeal Act of 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the commission&rsquo;s most recent hearing, on Nov.19, it heard testimony from Joseph D. Henchman, vice president of the Washington D.C.-based Tax Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among other things, he said part of the reason Rhode Island&rsquo;s sales tax rate is so high is because it taxes so little. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island&rsquo;s sales tax,&quot; Henchman said. &quot;Only Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Jersey have narrower sales taxes. You are exempting 75 percent of the economy from the sales tax already and imposing a higher rate on the rest that you do tax.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Rhode Island&rsquo;s sales tax really as narrow as Henchman says?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like most state sales taxes, Rhode Island&rsquo;s is limited to the sale of so-called tangible goods, not services, such as lawn-mowing or legal fees. It is further diminished by about 83 categories of exempted items such as food, most clothing, medicines, and, more recently, art works and wine. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Henchman told us he got Rhode Island&rsquo;s 25 percent figure from analysis done by John L. Mikesell, chancellor&rsquo;s professor of public and environmental affairs at the Indiana University. Mikesell is considered one of the nation&rsquo;s experts on state taxation policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Henchman said the figure came from a statistic Mikesell calls &quot;breadth of base,&quot; which estimates how much of a state&rsquo;s commerce is subject to its sales tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mikesell starts by taking a state&rsquo;s total sales tax revenue and determining how much in retail sales was needed to produce that amount, a figure he calls the &quot;implied retail sales tax base.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He then expresses that base as a percentage of the state&rsquo;s total personal income, the amount of money residents in the state have to spend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, Rhode Island&rsquo;s 7-percent sales tax raised $824 million, which, by Mikesell&rsquo;s calculation, required $11 billion in taxable sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its total personal income that year was about $44 billion, according to the state Department of Labor and Training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $11-billion figure is 25 percent of $44 billion, and that&rsquo;s the 25-percent figure that Henchman cited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s a problem. Mikesell is measuring the percent of a state&rsquo;s total personal <em>income </em>that is captured by its sales tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Henchman was talking about the percent of a state&rsquo;s total personal <em>spending </em>that is taxed, a very different amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get that figure, you&rsquo;d have to know the total amount of retail sales in the state. Coming up with that number is next to impossible because the state doesn&rsquo;t track sales it doesn&rsquo;t tax, said Paul Dion, chief of revenue analysis for the Rhode Island Department of Revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can&rsquo;t even tell you what our retail tax base is,&quot; Dion said. &quot;We&rsquo;d have to extrapolate that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, the Connecticut Office of Legislative Research was looking at that state&rsquo;s sales tax rate and it used Mikesell&rsquo;s percentage also, but it made the point that Mikesell&rsquo;s comparison was to income, not sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In other words, 26.19 percent of Connecticut personal income is spent on goods and services subject to the sales tax,&quot; the report said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we got back to Henchman, he said Mikesell&rsquo;s personal income figure provides a uniform number that allows state-by-state comparisons. Dion agreed, and said when he heard Henchman&rsquo;s statement, that&rsquo;s how he understood it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joseph Henchman of the Tax Foundation said: &quot;Only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island&rsquo;s sales tax.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the figure he cited actually referred to personal income, not what people buy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, no one knows what percentage of everything that Rhode Islanders buy is subject to the sales tax because no one calculates total spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dion might have understood what Henchman meant, but we have to go by what he said. We rule his statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\"><u>False</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Correction: In the initial version of this item, Joseph Henchman was incorrectly identified as John Henchman in the Source List. </em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-29T18:13:56.223609", "ruling_date": "2013-12-01T00:01:00", "ruling_headline": "Tax Foundation official says only 25 percent of what people buy in R.I. is subject to sales tax", "ruling_headline_slug": "tax-foundation-official-says-only-25-percent-what-", "ruling_link_text": "Figure applies to personal income, not spending", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/testimony-rhode-island-special-joint-legislative-commission-study-sales-tax-repeal\"><u>Testimony of Joseph Henchman</u></a> before the &nbsp;Special Joint Legislative Commission to Study the Sales Tax Repeal Act of 2013.
