Bernie Sanders &mdash; starting when Clinton asserted that she has continuously supported the Fight for $15 advocacy campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I have supported the Fight for $15,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the Fight for $15.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To Sanders, that was news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;When this campaign began, I said that we&rsquo;ve got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15. Secretary Clinton said let&#39;s raise it to $12.&quot; An extended back-and-forth followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re putting Sanders&rsquo; claim on the Truth-O-Meter. He&rsquo;s right that Clinton&rsquo;s official position is to raise the national minimum wage to $12 as a floor. However, she has also shown support for the Fight for $15 campaign that pushes for higher minimums in individual states and cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/plan-raise-american-incomes/\">Clinton&rsquo;s website says</a> on that point:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\">&quot;Hillary believes we are long overdue in raising the minimum wage. She has supported raising the federal minimum wage to $12, and believes that we should go further than the federal minimum through state and local efforts, and workers organizing and bargaining for higher wages, such as the Fight for $15 and recent efforts in Los Angeles and New York to raise their minimum wage to $15.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June 2015, early on in her campaign, Clinton spoke with a gathering of <a href=\"https://hillaryspeeches.com/2015/06/07/clinton-speaks-with-fight-for-15/\">Fight for $15</a> members via phone and told them she supported their campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;All of you should not have to march in the streets to get a living wage, but thank you for marching in the streets to get that living wage,&quot; she said, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/07/hillary-clinton-sounds-populist-note-at-fast-food-workers-convention/\">according to the <em>Washington Post</em></a><em>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few days later, Clinton delivered a <a href=\"http://time.com/3920332/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch/\">campaign kickoff speech</a> in which she called for raising the minimum wage, but she did not specify a number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her support for the $12 minimum wage proposal seems to have emerged around July 2015, when she praised legislation proposed by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., arguing that it would be more politically feasible. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let&rsquo;s not just do it for the sake of having a higher number out there,&quot; she said, according to the <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/30/hillary-clinton-speaks-favorably-about-12-minimum-wage/\">New York Times</a></em>. &quot;But let&rsquo;s get behind a proposal that actually has a chance of succeeding.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-i-favor-12-hour-minimum-wage\">By November,</a> Clinton had started to say plainly that she prefers a $12 federal minimum wage. In the same month, though, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/664070444425826304\">she tweeted</a> with the hashtag #FightFor15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What about Sanders? He&rsquo;s right that he has advocated specifically for a $15 minimum wage since his campaign began.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let us be honest and acknowledge that millions of Americans are now working for totally inadequate wages,&quot; &nbsp;he said as part of his <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/bernies-announcement/\">May 2015 announcement</a>. &quot;The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage and must be raised. The minimum wage must become a living wage, which means raising it to $15 an hour over the next few years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple months earlier, in March 2015,<a href=\"http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/republicans-oppose-minimum-wage-hike-as-senate-debates-budget\"> he put forward an amendment</a> to eventually raise the minimum wage to $15. He also put forth legislation in <a href=\"http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-introduces-bill-for-15-an-hour-minimum-wage\">July 2015</a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders said, &quot;When this campaign began, I said that we&rsquo;ve got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15. Secretary Clinton said let&#39;s raise it to $12.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the start of his campaign, Sanders has advocated for a $15 minimum wage. Since early on in her campaign, Clinton has supported the Fight for $15&rsquo;s efforts in individual cities and states. But her official position is that she prefers a $12 federal minimum wage as a floor, allowing cities and states to go further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders&rsquo; has a point that he is calling for a federal minimum wage that would be $3 more an hour than what Clinton says she favors. However, he misses the nuance that Clinton is also supportive of local efforts to raise the minimum wage to $15. We rate his claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c08e34bc-e615-4605-84d8-f2637305f291\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c08e34bc-e615-4605-84d8-f2637305f291</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-04-15T00:10:40.026563", "ruling_date": "2016-04-15T00:12:43", "ruling_headline": "Does Hillary Clinton want a $15 or $12 minimum wage?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-hillary-clinton-want-15-or-12-minimum-wage", "ruling_link_text": "A nuanced position", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/14/the-brooklyn-democratic-debate-transcript-annotated/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The Brooklyn Democratic debate transcript,</u></a>&quot; April 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton campaign, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/plan-raise-american-incomes/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>A plan to raise American incomes</u></a>,&quot; accessed April 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NPR, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/04/02/472434968/has-bernie-sanders-pulled-hillary-clinton-to-the-left\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Has Bernie Sanders Pulled Hillary Clinton To The Left?</u></a>&quot; April 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders Senate office, <a href=\"http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-introduces-bill-for-15-an-hour-minimum-wage\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Sanders Introduces Bill for $15-an-Hour Minimum Wage</u></a>,&quot; July 22, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders Senate office, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/republicans-oppose-minimum-wage-hike-as-senate-debates-budget\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Republicans Oppose Minimum Wage Hike as Senate Debates Budget,</u></a>&quot; March 26, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders campaign, &quot;<a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/bernies-announcement/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bernie&rsquo;s Announcement</u></a>,&quot; May 26, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MSNBC, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-i-favor-12-hour-minimum-wage\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hillary Clinton: &lsquo;I favor a $12 an hour minimum wage&rsquo;</u></a>&quot; Nov. 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/30/hillary-clinton-speaks-favorably-about-12-minimum-wage/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hillary Clinton Speaks Favorably About $12 Minimum Wage</u></a>,&quot; July 30, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time, &quot;<a href=\"http://time.com/3920332/transcript-full-text-hillary-clinton-campaign-launch/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Transcript: Read the Full Text of Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s Campaign Launch Speech</u></a>,&quot; June 13, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/07/hillary-clinton-sounds-populist-note-at-fast-food-workers-convention/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hillary Clinton endorses fight for a $15 minimum wage</u></a>,&quot; June 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson, April 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Sanders spokesman Warren Gunnels, April 14, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 20, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 15, "first_name": "Bernie", "half_true_count": 28, "home_state": "Vermont", "id": 218, "last_name": "Sanders", "mostly_true_count": 46, "name_slug": "bernie-sanders", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 6, "party": "Independent", "party_slug": "independent", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/6/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "edition": "Vermont", "edition_slug": "vermont", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 65, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "Vermont Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/65/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/218/", "total_count": 129, "true_count": 16, "website": "http://sanders.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;When this campaign began, I said that we&rsquo;ve got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15.
