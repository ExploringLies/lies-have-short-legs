Scott Walker&rsquo;s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were struck by the final statement -- that Burke &quot;says she&rsquo;s on the side of the middle class,&quot; but that &quot;Burke&rsquo;s 2007-&#39;09 state budget had a tax hike of $1.8 billion -- costing every man, woman and child in the state an extra $310.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burke&rsquo;s state budget?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Was she governor?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked for backup to the claim, state GOP spokesman Jesse Dougherty said Burke created the Commerce portion of the 2007-&rsquo;09 budget; worked with Doyle &quot;on his final product&quot;; and promoted the overall budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we found in rating a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/19/republican-party-wisconsin/state-gop-says-burke-drafted-and-promoted-state-bu/\"><u>similar claim</u></a> by the state party in February 2014, Burke was responsible for and submitted the Commerce portion of Doyle&rsquo;s overall 2007-&rsquo;09 budget. We also found that she spoke out enthusiastically in favor of the overall plan, saying it &quot;identifies our priorities for success.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But to call it &quot;Burke&rsquo;s budget&quot; is something different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GOP might as well have called it Frank Busalacchi&rsquo;s budget (he was Doyle&rsquo;s transportation secretary at the time) or Kevin Hayden&rsquo;s budget (Doyle&rsquo;s health and family services secretary).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For that matter, when Doyle&rsquo;s 2007-&rsquo;09 budget proposal was introduced it exceeded <a href=\"http://www.doa.state.wi.us/Documents/DEBF/Budget/Biennial%20Budget/Biennial%20Budget%20Archives/2007-09%20Biennial%20Budget/2007-09_BIB.pdf\"><u>$57 billion</u></a>, with the Commerce Department getting about &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.doa.state.wi.us/Documents/DEBF/Budget/Biennial%20Budget/Biennial%20Budget%20Archives/2007-09%20Biennial%20Budget/143_COMM.pdf\"><u>$413.7 million</u></a>, or less than 1 percent of the total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Wisconsin, the state budget is set by elected officials, not appointed Cabinet secretaries. The governor submits a budget. The Legislature, typically after making changes, adopts the budget. Finally, the governor signs the budget into law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the rest of the claim, that the budget raised taxes by $1.8 billion, Doyle&rsquo;s proposed budget did seek a total revenue increase of nearly $1.8 billion -- $1.37 billion in taxes and the rest in fees. Wisconsin&#39;s total population was about 5.67 million at the time, so the total increase in taxes and fees would have been about $310 per person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, while the figures are essentially correct, the thrust of the claim is an attack on Burke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And to say Doyle&rsquo;s budget was hers goes too far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state GOP said &quot;Burke&#39;s 2007-&#39;09 state budget had a tax hike of $1.8 billion -- costing every man, woman and child in the state an extra $310.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The figures are basically on target, but the real target of the party&rsquo;s claim was Burke. And to put a governor&rsquo;s entire state budget on an appointed Cabinet secretary is a misfire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-testing-state-gop-claim-on-mary-burke-state-budget-b99224663z1-250389121.html\">web page</a>.</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-03-13T11:47:43.255505", "ruling_date": "2014-03-16T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin GOP says Mary Burke, Scott Walker's challenger, was responsible for state budget when she served as a Cabinet secretary", "ruling_headline_slug": "wisconsin-gop-says-mary-burke-scott-walkers-challe", "ruling_link_text": "Her department\u2019s portion: Less than 1%", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wisconsin Republican Party, &quot;Millionaire Mary Burke: Pants on Fire&quot; <a href=\"http://www.wisgop.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mary-Burkes-Pants-on-Fire1.jpg\"><u>web page</u></a>, accessed March 13, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/19/republican-party-wisconsin/state-gop-says-burke-drafted-and-promoted-state-bu/\"><u>&quot;State GOP says Burke drafted and promoted state budgets that were fiscally irresponsible,&quot;</u></a> Feb. 19, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/18/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-policies-democrat-jim-doyle-/\"><u>&quot;Gov.
