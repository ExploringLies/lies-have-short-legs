For many people in my State, the boardwalk isn&#39;t just a source of pride, it&#39;s a source of critical income to our state,&quot; according to Lautenberg&rsquo;s speech published in The Congressional Record. &quot;In 2008, tourism brought in $38 billion dollars and supported more than 300,000 jobs in the state of New Jersey. Families came from all over the country to walk the boardwalk in Atlantic City or take a fishing boat out of one of our ports, Point Pleasant or one of the others, or ride the roller coaster at a pier in Seaside Heights.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor this fact-check, we&rsquo;re focusing on the senator&rsquo;s claim about tourism in 2008 and the number of jobs created in that field.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLautenberg spokesman Caley Gray said the senator&rsquo;s statement wasn&rsquo;t meant to imply that New Jersey received $38 billion in tax revenue for 2008. Instead, Gray said, Lautenberg was referring to the overall financial impact tourism has on the Garden State.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Senator Lautenberg was referring to the amount of money spent on tourism in New Jersey and he is right that tourism is a huge generator of revenue for New Jersey businesses,&quot; Gray said in an e-mail. &quot;Senator Lautenberg will continue working in Washington to convince his colleagues about the need for disaster relief and to rebuild the state&#39;s $38 billion tourism industry.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow widespread is tourism in New Jersey&rsquo;s economy?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA 2008 tourism economic impact study shows that the bulk of tourism spending that year -- 33.4 percent -- was in the greater Atlantic City region.
