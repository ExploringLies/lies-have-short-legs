It has not explained why, but notes that Hovde has given almost exclusively to Republicans, and in much larger amounts.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, did Hovde&rsquo;s remarks suggest he has no problem with raising taxes?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe watched the nearly 11-minute discussion between Hovde and the cable show&rsquo;s hosts and found a brief exchange on taxes that closely -- but not exactly -- mirrors the language in the group&rsquo;s ad.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The background</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde&rsquo;s March 3, 2009 appearance on CNBC focused on the ongoing financial crisis and his criticisms of actions under both Republican President George W. Bush and newly elected President Barack Obama. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde said the country was in a &quot;depression,&quot; Obama&rsquo;s stimulus bill was unfocused and out of control federal spending was taking the country into &quot;quasi-Socialist&quot; territory.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the 7:25 mark of the segment, as the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/148778585.html#%21page=2&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst\">Journal Sentinel&rsquo;s Dan Bice </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/148778585.html#%21page=2&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst\">reported</a> in April 2012, Hovde abruptly turned the talk to taxes, tax breaks and the Obama administration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnprompted, he began: &quot;Look, I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes. I&rsquo;ve been blessed in my life and I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate. But some of the things that they&rsquo;ve done are just insane.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen he referred to an Obama <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/14/business/fi-deduct14\">2009 </a><a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/14/business/fi-deduct14\">proposal </a>to reduce the mortgage-interest tax deduction for households earning more than $250,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Taking away deductions on home mortgage payments -- I don&rsquo;t need it, but a lot of other people do.&quot; Hovde said. &quot;We&rsquo;re in a housing recession -- are you kidding me?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, the Club for Growth claims Hovde said he had &quot;no problem with raising taxes.&quot; He actually said: &quot;I have no problem with me getting charged higher taxes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a significant difference, especially since he immediately noted that eliminating housing deductions, for instance, would be unwise in a recession.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe timing is also important.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2009, Hovde was a private citizen, not a candidate running on a platform of what he would do if elected.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn candidate can have a personal opinion on an issue but may decide to vote another way for a variety of reasons. For instance, a lawmaker personally would not seek an abortion but votes pro-choice to leave the decision up to the mother.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s also unclear from the 2009 CNBC interview exactly what Hovde was talking about. Did he mean paying more through a higher top tax rate? Through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen asked about the claim, the Club for Growth noted it would take a tax increase of some kind for Hovde&rsquo;s personal tax bill to rise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs a candidate in 2012, Hovde <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/148778585.html#%21page=2&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst\">told </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/148778585.html#%21page=2&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst\">Bice </a>he was not referring to Obama&rsquo;s so-called Buffett Rule legislation to make sure high earners pay at least 30 percent in federal income tax (a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic candidate in the race).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde has said he was thinking of the tax break on &quot;carried interest&quot; -- the portion of a fund&rsquo;s investment gains taken by fund managers (like Hovde) as compensation. It also applies to venture capitalists and private equity specialists.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an interview, Hovde agreed that it would be a tax increase for that narrow group. Some government estimates put the total at more than $1 billion a year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut let&rsquo;s look at his tax positions as a candidate in 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde has <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/97465146/The-Hovde-Tax-Plan\">pledged </a>to reduce individual income tax rates across the board, drop the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent and eliminate the estate tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Hovde has made it clear he is against raising tax rates. In fact, he wants dramatic cuts in people&rsquo;s tax bills.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat leaves his support for eliminating tax deductions -- a move that would bring the government more revenue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde says he would vote to eliminate &quot;nearly all&quot; of the deductions in the current tax code, which he sees as riddled with favors to big corporations at the expense of small businesses. He also thinks the individual tax code is too complicated.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd he told us he still favors eliminating the &quot;carried interest&quot; tax provision, which he sees as eliminating a loophole.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde, who has made debt and deficit reduction a major theme, has told voters he would accept a budget-balancing deal that gets $10 in spending cuts for every $1 in new revenue through the elimination of loopholes or deductions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe told us his strong preference would be that such a deal include cuts in the tax rates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said he would consider supporting a 10-to-1 deal that holds rates steady instead of lowering them, depending on which loopholes or deductions are removed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut does that constitute a tax increase?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven conservative Republicans disagree on this. Americans for Tax Reform&rsquo;s widely publicized &quot;<a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/091411-federalpledgesigners.pdf\">taxpayer protection pledge</a>&quot; frowns on deduction eliminations unless the new revenue is completely offset by lower rates. Thompson and Neumann have signed that pledge, but Hovde has not. &nbsp;A leading conservative in the Senate, Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/opinion/a-greater-american-pledge.html\">criticized the group&rsquo;s </a><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/opinion/a-greater-american-pledge.html\">pledge </a>as too narrow to allow for smart reform of the tax code.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact National consulted a range of experts in January 2012 in evaluating a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/11/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-has-raised-taxes-19-/\">Mitt Romney </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/11/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-has-raised-taxes-19-/\">claim </a>that Obama &quot;has raised taxes 19 times.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tViews differed on some issues, but the consensus was that eliminating or limiting such deductions as those for prescription or other medical expenses clearly deserved the label of tax increases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDonald Marron, director of the Tax Policy Center, told us it&rsquo;s case by case -- some of these &quot;tax preferences&quot; are best seen as taxes, but others as spending programs in disguise.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGiven Hovde&rsquo;s pledge to wipe out nearly all deductions, it seems clear that some of those moves could be labeled as tax increases. Even Hovde acknowledged eliminating the &quot;carried interest&quot; provision would be a tax increase for a narrow group.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe national Club for Growth used Hovde&rsquo;s own words from a cable TV interview in 2009 to frame him as in favor of raising taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHovde said what he said -- he would pay more, which put him on record as open to some kind of tax increase. There&rsquo;s no other way to read it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the ad takes the 2009 comment and alters it in a subtle but significant way, changing the context. By also changing the timing, leaving viewers thinking Hovde is campaigning in 2012 on a plan to raise taxes, the issue is further distorted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the current campaign, Hovde has made it clear he wants dramatically lower taxes and would not raise rates, while staying open to a net revenue increase from loophole elimination as part of a massive spending-and-tax-cut deal. That doesn&rsquo;t square with the breezy portrayal of Hovde as having &quot;no problem raising taxes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Truth-O-Meter says Mostly False claims have an element of truth but ignore critical facts that would give a different impression.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe think that fits the Club for Growth ad claim. Mostly False.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-31T18:34:38.875342", "ruling_date": "2012-08-01T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Club for Growth says Hovde has \u2018no problem with raising taxes\u2019", "ruling_headline_slug": "club-growth-says-hovde-has-no-problem-raising-taxe", "ruling_link_text": "Actually he wants broad tax cuts", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tClub for Growth, TV ad, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4LFYBPuEoE\">&quot;Only Worse,</a>&quot;
