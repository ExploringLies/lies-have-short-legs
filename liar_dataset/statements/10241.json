Scott Walker&rsquo;s re-election on Nov. 4, 2014, drew plenty of love from conservative commentators bullish about his chances to make a splash in the 2016 presidential race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Nation Needs President Scott Walker in 2016,&quot; shouted a headline over a <a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2014/11/11/the-nation-needs-president-scott-walker-in-2016/\">story by Richard Cromwell in The Federalist</a>, an online magazine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But not everyone on the right was leading cheers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Same magazine, different take: &quot;Winning Re-Election Doesn&rsquo;t Mean Scott Walker Is Ready For 2016.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The author of that <a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2014/11/11/winning-re-election-doesnt-mean-scott-walker-is-ready-for-2016/\">Nov. 11 piece</a> is the managing editor of the magazine, <a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/author/joy-pullmann/\">Joy Pullmann, an education researcher at the conservative Heartland Institute based in Chicago.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pullmann has dogged Walker on several issues, including what <a href=\"http://heartland.org/press-releases/2014/07/18/heartland-institute-education-experts-react-wisconsin-gov-scott-walkers-ca\">she views as his belated shift to oppose the Common Core</a> state standards for schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One week after Walker topped Democrat Mary Burke, Pullmann -- a former teacher and self-described &quot;born and raised Wisconsin farm girl&quot; -- again was talking down Walker&rsquo;s accomplishments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She argued his moves to boost private schools with public money, cut taxes and all but end public-sector collective bargaining were half measures. Aside from going after public employee unions, she argued, Walker has been too nice and too passive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular she cited &quot;a pitiful 500-student increase to Milwaukee&rsquo;s voucher program, the nation&rsquo;s oldest, because Walker couldn&rsquo;t get his own party members to back a real expansion despite full control of Wisconsin&rsquo;s legislative and executive branches.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She added:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Whoop de doo. In Indiana, Mitch Daniels&rsquo; voucher program is approaching 30,000 students two years after opening. He knew how to work with his legislature &mdash; and they ain&rsquo;t any less ornery and squishy than Wisconsin Republicans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Daniels -- a Walker favorite who served two terms as governor ending in 2013 -- spectacularly outdo Walker on school vouchers despite favorable political conditions for the GOP in Madison?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first glance, the programs appear pretty similar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin currently pays for 29,683 students to attend non-public schools. In Indiana, the figure also tops 29,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But most of the growth in the Wisconsin program long pre-dates Walker, while Indiana has surged to Wisconsin&rsquo;s level in just four years. Daniels <a href=\"http://www.edchoice.org/Newsroom/News/Indiana-Gov--Mitch-Daniels-Signs-Historic-Voucher-Bill-into-Law.aspx\">won passage of the program in 2011</a>, the same year Walker&rsquo;s first term began in Wisconsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Wisconsin, vouchers were born 25 years ago through a Milwaukee-only program. It was a pioneering effort nationally in the use of public tax dollars to enable parents to send their children to private and/or religious schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was under Walker that the program expanded beyond Milwaukee, to more than 25 municipalities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Pullmann alludes, accurately, to the fact Daniels was able to get vouchers approved statewide right from the get-go, while Walker settled for a gradual and limited expansion even with a Republican-controlled Legislature and a 2012 recall win under his belt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She misstates some facts and undersells Walker&rsquo;s record on vouchers, though, in saying he won a mere &quot;500-student increase to Milwaukee&rsquo;s voucher program.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker did cap the increase at 500 additional students in 2013-&rsquo;14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that cap of 500 students is old news; the statewide limit went up to 1,000 new students for 2014-&rsquo;15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also left out of the equation are earlier expansions on Walker&rsquo;s watch. Walker lifted Milwaukee&rsquo;s 22,500 enrollment limit in 2011. He also signed the expansion of the program to Racine in 2011-&rsquo;12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these moves combined to allow more than 5,000 new students into the program annually, 10 times the amount Pullmann credits him for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, Indiana <a href=\"http://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/choice/choice-scholarship-program-annual-report-061614.pdf\">went from 0 to more than 29,000 in four years</a>. The program there was capped at 7,500 its first year and at 15,000 in its second, but now has no cap. Wisconsin&rsquo;s program outside Milwaukee and Racine is still capped at 1,000 students, though Walker and legislators have signalled they want to raise that limit in the next term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voucher advocate Kara Kerwin, president of the <a href=\"https://www.edreform.com/\">Center for Education Reform</a>, said Pullmann was right to describe Walker&rsquo;s approach as incrementalism compared to the Indiana experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But &quot;Indiana was in a different position because others had already paved the road,&quot; Kerwin said. Both states fared very well in the Center&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.edreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/VoucherRankings-Report5.pdf\">2014 state scorecard on voucher plans</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indiana ranked #1 (&quot;a universal voucher program open to all students across the state and no limit on the number of vouchers that can be awarded.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wisconsin tied for #2 (&quot;a much-restricted statewide program, both in terms of income eligibility and number of available vouchers.&quot;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the political front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker faced the reality that some GOP senators balked at expanding the program beyond Milwaukee and Racine. He proposed a cap, but one that would expire; legislators made the 1,000-student limit indefinite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Walker press secretary Laurel Patrick why the Republican governor proposed a cap on out-state enrollment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Our office worked with the Legislature and this was the avenue that had the most support, especially due to concerns about funding and the capacity for expansion,&quot; Patrick told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pullmann wrote &nbsp;that Scott Walker &quot;couldn&rsquo;t get his own party&quot; to back more than a 500-student increase in Milwaukee&rsquo;s school choice program, but in Indiana, &quot;Mitch Daniels&rsquo; voucher program is approaching 30,000 students two years after opening.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She&rsquo;s on target on the basic notion of Indiana&rsquo;s speed vs. Wisconsin&rsquo;s gradualism, but leaves out or muffs some important details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate her claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-11-20T15:44:56.164001", "ruling_date": "2014-11-21T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Joy Pullmann says Scott Walker couldn\u2019t get legislature to significantly expand school choice", "ruling_headline_slug": "joy-pullmann-says-scott-walker-couldnt-get-legisla", "ruling_link_text": "Slower in Wisconsin, but not that slow", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Federalist, <a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2014/11/11/winning-re-election-doesnt-mean-scott-walker-is-ready-for-2016/\">&quot;Winning Re-Election Doesn&rsquo;t Mean Scott Walker&rsquo;s Ready for 2016,&quot; </a>Nov. 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails with Joy Pullmann, The Federalist managing editor, Nov. 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email with Daniel Altman, Press Secretary, Indiana Department of Education, Nov. 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with John Johnson and Thomas McCarthy, spokesmen, Department of Public Instruction, Nov. 18, 2014<br />\r\nInterview with Laurel Patrick, Gov.
