That is the procedure right now.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Ryan right that under the current procedure, if someone &quot;on a terror watch list&quot; tries to buy a gun, authorities are notified?</p> <a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/147e8831-dbe4-4d9a-9465-f16b248bd0bc\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/147e8831-dbe4-4d9a-9465-f16b248bd0bc</a>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How gun screening works</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Ryan&rsquo;s office to provide backup for his claim, a spokesman pointed to a <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10703t.pdf\">2010 U.S. Government Accountability Office report</a>. That report states the FBI is alerted when a federal background check for a gun transfer is performed on someone whose name is on a terrorist watch list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We confirmed the same with Dave Joly, a spokesman for the FBI&rsquo;s Terrorist Screening Center, and Second Amendment expert Adam Winkler, a law professor at the UCLA School of Law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such background checks are mandated under a federal law called the <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bjs/grants/234173.pdf\">Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act</a> &mdash; commonly known as the &quot;Brady Bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>States can choose to conduct the background checks themselves, or have the FBI perform them. Either way, a background check involves verifying the buyer&rsquo;s identity and searching for information in databases that would determine if the gun purchase is illegal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, someone who is under indictment, has a felony conviction, uses illicit drugs or is an illegal immigrant is not permitted to buy a gun. Background checks typically result in approving the gun purchase, denying it or imposing a three-day delay to allow for further investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While conducting such checks, the federal government can screen for people whose names appear on terrorist watch lists &mdash; though the fact someone is on such a list does not alone disqualify that person from buying a gun under the Brady Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the vast majority of people on terror watch lists have been allowed to purchase guns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal government began cross-referencing gun background checks with terrorist watch lists in 2004, and through 2015, there were 2,477 instances when someone on a terrorist watch list was involved in a gun background check. About 91 percent of those transactions were permitted, <a href=\"http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=F53C4195-430D-4D8D-ACDE-1EC53E97D0FA&amp;SK=EF4E6FF4158FFA49E570234A3DE8E438\">according to the Government Accountability Office</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If federal authorities are notified someone on a terrorist watch list is trying to buy a gun, they can take steps to thwart the purchase. For instance, investigators can review paperwork the prospective gun buyer completed to check for other new, potentially disqualifying information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Private sales excluded</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, the Brady Bill does not require background checks for all gun transfers: It applies only to gun sales by federally licensed firearm dealers. Unlicensed sellers are not required to document or report sales under the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least 18 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that go beyond the Brady Bill and require background checks in some private gun sales, <a href=\"http://smartgunlaws.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/background-checks/universal-background-checks/\">according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence</a>, a nonprofit organization that tracks firearm laws and litigation in the United States and seeks to reduce gun violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the other states &mdash; including Wisconsin &mdash; have no such requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no definitive figure of how many private gun sales occur, although experts have made some informed estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/165476.pdf\">A National Institute of Justice study</a> estimated there were 13.7 million gun transfers between 1993 and 1994 in the United States; roughly 60 percent involved licensed dealers, while about 40 percent were &quot;off-the-books transfers&quot; through unlicensed sellers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Preliminary data from a more recent, yet-to-be-published survey suggests the proportion of unlicensed gun sales has decreased, but such sales still involve millions of guns each year, according to Northeastern University Professor Matthew Miller, who co-directs the Harvard Injury Control Research Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan said that under the current procedure, if someone &quot;on a terror watch list&quot; tries to buy a gun, authorities are notified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is accurate as it applies to gun sales in which a federal background check occurs. But a significant amount of gun sales or other transfers lack background checks, so there would be no red flag when someone on the list tries to buy a gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a statement that is partially accurate, but leaves out important details, we rate Ryan&rsquo;s claim Half True.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-09-01T16:18:50.909545", "ruling_date": "2016-09-02T10:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Paul Ryan: If someone \"on a terror watch list\" tries to buy a gun, authorities are notified", "ruling_headline_slug": "paul-ryan-if-someone-terror-watch-list-tries-buy-g", "ruling_link_text": "Not if attempt is through a private dealer", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Paul Ryan, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNtCxGHFWl8\">comments on NBC&rsquo;s &quot;Meet the Press,&quot;</a> June 19, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Dave Joly, Federal Bureau of Investigation, July 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Paul Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana, July 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Adam Winkler, UCLA Law School professor , Aug. 8, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Northeastern University Professor Matthew Miller, Aug. 23, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>United States Government Accountability Office, <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10703t.pdf\">&quot;FBI Has Enhanced Its Use of Information from Firearm and Explosives Background Checks to Support Counterterrorism Efforts,&quot;</a> May 5, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=F53C4195-430D-4D8D-ACDE-1EC53E97D0FA&amp;SK=EF4E6FF4158FFA49E570234A3DE8E438\">Letter from United States Government Accountability Office to U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein</a>, March 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Research Service, <a href=\"http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/209937.pdf\">&quot;Terrorist Watch List Screening and Background Checks for Firearms,&quot;</a> May 1, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Justice, National Institute of Justice, <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/165476.pdf\">&quot;Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms,&quot;</a> May 1997</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regional Justice Information Service, <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bjs/grants/234173.pdf\">&quot;Enforcement of the Brady Act, 2009: Federal and State Investigations and Prosecutions of Firearm Applicants Denied by a NICS Check in 2009,&quot;</a> April 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, <a href=\"http://smartgunlaws.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/background-checks/universal-background-checks/\">&quot;Universal Background Checks,&quot;</a> accessed Aug. 29, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FactCheck.org, <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/06/suspected-terrorists-and-guns/\">&quot;Fact check: Suspected Terrorists and Guns,&quot;</a> June 20, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jan/07/politifact-sheet-3-things-know-about-gun-show-loop/\">&quot;3 things to know about the &#39;gun show loophole,&rsquo;&quot;</a> January 7, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USA TODAY, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/06/13/james-comey-fbi-orlando-shooting/85834956/\">&quot;FBI: Orlando gunman not directed by foreign terror group,&quot;</a> June 13, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Times, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/us/omar-mateen-fbi.html\">&quot;Orlando Gunman Was on Terror Watchlist, F.B.I.
