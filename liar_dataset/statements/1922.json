This year seems to be no exception, and the candidates running for  office know it.<br /><br />One example was an ad shipped by mail from the  campaign of Ken Hodges, a Democrat running for Georgia attorney general.<br /><br />\"Rob  Teilhet,\" the advertisement reads. \"Just another career politician.\"<br /><br />The  Hodges campaign says it can easily back up its claim. Teilhet, they  say, first ran for political office two years after he graduated from  law school. Teilhet, a Cobb County Democrat, has been a state  representative for eight years and now wants to be attorney general.<br /><br />\"We  call Teilhet a politician because he is one,\" Hodges campaign manager  Shannon Marietta wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact Georgia.<br /><br />After  reviewing a similar claim in a Republican Party campaign, PolitiFact  Georgia was eager to dig into the merits of this Democrat-on-Democrat  attack.<br /><br />The Hodges campaign has its facts right about Teilhet's  background. In 2002, two years after Teilhet graduated from law school,  he made his first bid for public office. The Atlanta  Journal-Constitution wrote about Teilhet and a wave of other young faces  coming to the Georgia Capitol in 2003.<br /><br />\"I assumed I would be the  young gun in Cobb,\" he said. \"Seeing two other elected officials even  younger, I feel like I'm just another old, white guy.\"<br /><br />Teilhet  was 28 at the time. He's now 36, with eight years in the Legislature.<br /><br />Teilhet  is a workers' compensation attorney. His campaign manager Rebecca  DeHart notes it's a full-time job, as opposed to Teilhet's time at the  Legislature, which has 40 meeting days a year. The Hodges campaign  suggests Teilhet isn't doing much work outside the Capitol. They could  find only 19 cases he's been involved with in the past 10 years. The  Teilhet campaign countered he works about 40 cases a year.<br /><br />Hodges,  44, has served as Dougherty County district attorney for the past 12  years. He's been re-elected twice. The Teilhet camp says it's hard to  call someone a \"career politician\" when you've been in office longer  than the other candidate.<br /><br />Emory University political science  professor Andra Gillespie agrees.<br /><br />\"If you are going to throw a  punch, it is going to come back at you in some shape or form,\" she said.  \"It's the pot calling the kettle black.\"<br /><br />Marietta contends that  being a district attorney is less political than being a state lawmaker.  Gillespie believes there's still politics involved with campaigning for  and serving as district attorney.<br /><br />Teilhet has been involved in  politics basically since he graduated law school. He is certainly a  young man in a hurry, and one with major political ambitions.<br /><br />But  some political experts believe his eight years in the Legislature does  not qualify Teilhet for the title \"career politician.\" Some, like  Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint, say  Hodges should not make such accusations, based on his 12 years in  office.<br /><br />\"They might not have thought this through,\" he said.<br /><br />We  rate this attack as Barely True.</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
