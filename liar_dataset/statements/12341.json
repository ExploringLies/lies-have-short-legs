So we decided to look into it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bottom line: Trump did try to hire hundreds of foreign workers at his Mar-A-Lago resort in Palm Beach, although it&rsquo;s unclear just how many actually took jobs. The workers also weren&rsquo;t necessarily replacing Americans, but filled temporary jobs locals allegedly couldn&rsquo;t do or didn&rsquo;t want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mar-A-Lago foreign workers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.maralagoclub.com/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mar-A-Lago Club</u></a> in Palm Beach County is an oceanfront eating club designed for the 1 percenters. The club&rsquo;s website describes itself as offering &quot;an incomparable, royal lifestyle&quot; in a historic 126-room mansion. It offers a beach and pool, a spa and fine dining for those who can afford the $100,000 initiation fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The club&rsquo;s director of human resources referred us to the campaign for this fact-check, and a campaign spokeswoman did not respond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The charge that Trump hires foreign workers revolves around the club seeking H-2B visas for low-skilled workers such as cooks, wait staff and housekeepers. <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2b-temporary-non-agricultural-workers\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>H-2B visas</u></a> are legal &mdash; Congress has set the cap at 66,000 per year &mdash; and its agricultural counterpart is the H-2A visa. Nationwide for both programs, the vast majority of the workers are young Mexican men, although news reports say Trump sought workers from Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employers argue they need these temporary workers to fill jobs Americans don&rsquo;t want, while critics say the workers can be exploited. Since the visas are tied to a particular job, the foreigners can&rsquo;t simply jump ship for a better paying job at another resort, and unlike Americans, they may be reluctant to raise any complaints with their employers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2010, nearly 300 U.S. residents applied or were referred for jobs at Mar-A-Lago,<strong> </strong>but only 17 were hired, the <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/us/politics/donald-trump-taps-foreign-work-force-for-his-florida-club.html?_r=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>New York Times</u></a></em> reported. Meanwhile, Mar-A-Lago sought more than 500 visas for foreign workers. (The visas were also sought at some of his other properties.) We don&rsquo;t know how many people actually used the visas and became employees. A spokesman for the State Department said that information is kept confidential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To obtain the visas, businesses must prove they tried but couldn&rsquo;t fill positions with Americans or legal residents. According to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, the resort posted jobs through CareerSource Florida, the local workforce development boards throughout the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A U.S. Labor Department spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that 93 people applied for 250 seasonal job openings. Four were hired, while 79 didn&rsquo;t answer interview requests or turned down jobs (10 applications were classified with unknown status).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Documents the resort later filed with the Labor Department showed that many of the American applicants weren&rsquo;t hired because they didn&rsquo;t meet requirements. Some applicants didn&rsquo;t want to work split shifts, or didn&rsquo;t have enough experience. Many wanted full-time jobs instead of part&nbsp;time, or didn&rsquo;t respond when the resort contacted them. One applicant said they only were applying as a prerequisite to continue getting unemployment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that process, the Labor Department <a href=\"https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>certified 685 H-2B visas</u></a> for the Mar-A-Lago Club between 2008 and 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News reports suggested Mar-A-Lago did the bare minimum to meet legal requirements to try to recruit U.S. workers. For example, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/18/news/economy/trump-maralago/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>CNN</u></a> wrote that job openings were placed in a local newspaper with small circulation for just two days rather than a larger newspaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nationally, while employers claim there are labor shortages in lower- and semi-skilled occupations, &quot;there is no credible evidence that such labor shortages exist,&quot; wrote Daniel Costa, an immigration expert at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, in a <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/h2b-temporary-foreign-worker-program-for-labor-shortages-or-cheap-temporary-labor/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>paper</u></a> in January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>New York Times</em> asked Trump why he hired so many foreign workers when Americans applied for the same positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The only reason they wouldn&rsquo;t get a callback is that they weren&rsquo;t qualified, for some reason,&quot; Trump replied. &quot;There are very few qualified people during the high season in the area.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But some experts question Trump&rsquo;s assessment that it&rsquo;s hard to find local help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, CareerSource assisted in placing nearly 1,800 candidates in hospitality jobs in Palm Beach County. But Mar-A-Lago didn&rsquo;t show much interest in using the free service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Veenstra, senior director of support services at CareerSource in Palm Beach County, told PolitiFact Florida that the first time his office received a request for helping finding workers was September 2015. (That was shortly after one of the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-exclusive-idUSKCN0Q62RQ20150802\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>first news reports</u></a>, by Reuters, about Trump&rsquo;s foreign hiring practice.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since that time, Mar-A-Lago used the office to hire just one person, a banquet server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We called the HR director after the hire, and she said they were pleased with the hire and the candidates we sent them,&quot; Veenstra said. &quot;There has been nothing else since then.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are plenty of local applicants, said Greg Schell, an attorney in Palm Beach County who represents foreign workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The local job fairs for hotels and other hospitality jobs are overwhelmed with applicants,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Cruz ad says that Donald Trump &quot;brings in hundreds of foreign workers to replace Americans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal labor records show Trump sought visas for hundreds of foreign workers to fill temporary positions at his Mar-A-Lago Club in recent years. Hundreds of U.S. applicants either applied or were referred for the jobs, but only a handful were hired. There is some debate about whether those applicants were qualified or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz makes it sound like foreign workers took jobs from Americans already in positions, but that&rsquo;s not the case. It&rsquo;s an ongoing debate whether there were qualified Americans who would have been willing to work the seasonal, part-time service jobs for which the club was hiring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3005282b-5e81-43c3-8528-a8e96171c7a7\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3005282b-5e81-43c3-8528-a8e96171c7a7</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-05-05T13:58:25.071659", "ruling_date": "2016-05-06T15:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump attacked for bringing in hundreds of foreign workers on H-2B visas at Mar-A-Lago", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-attacked-bringing-hundreds-foreign-wo", "ruling_link_text": "Cheap labor for a posh resort", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Ted Cruz campaign, <a href=\"http://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_tedcruz_donaldtrump_tnc81/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>TV ad</u></a>, May 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mar-A-Lago, <a href=\"http://www.maralagoclub.com/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Website</u></a>, Accessed May 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Homeland Security Citizenship and Immigration Services, <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2b-temporary-non-agricultural-workers\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>H-2B Temporary Non-Agricultural Workers</u></a>, Accessed May 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Department of Homeland Security Citizenship and Immigration Services, <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-5161.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Application for visas</u></a>, Accessed May 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economic Policy Institute, The H-2B temporary foreign worker program</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reuters, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-exclusive-idUSKCN0Q62RQ20150802\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Donald Trump&rsquo;s Companies have sought visas to import at least 1,100 workers,&quot;</u></a> Aug. 15, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS4, <a href=\"http://miami.cbslocal.com/2015/09/22/exclusive-trumps-use-of-foreign-workers-in-florida-questioned/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Exclusive: Trump&rsquo;s Use Of Foreign Workers In Florida Questioned,&quot;</u></a> Sept. 22, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Palm Beach Post</em>, <a href=\"http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/local/cerabino-why-does-trump-hire-foreign-workers-at-ma/nnnyp/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Why is &#39;job-creator&#39;
