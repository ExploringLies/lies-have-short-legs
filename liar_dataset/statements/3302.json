Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, said not many Texans have the state license that&rsquo;s required to even carry a concealed gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have over 25 million people who live in Texas and less than 2 percent of them have these licenses,&quot; he said on CNN on Feb. 22.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the 2010 census, about 25.1 million people live in Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we turned to the Texas Department of Public Safety. Spokesman Tom Vinger told us that &quot;a little over 460,000&quot; people in Texas have concealed handgun licenses. A 1995 Texas law allows adults 21 and older who meet certain requirements, including passing a background check, to get such licenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vinger pointed us to the department&rsquo;s annual reports on active concealed handgun license and instructor counts. As of Dec. 31, Texas has 461,724 active license holders, according to the department&rsquo;s most recent <a href=\"http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/administration/crime_records/chl/PDF/ActLicAndInstr/ActiveLicandInstr2010.pdf\">report</a>, posted online Feb. 14.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also wondered whether other states had a similarly low percentage of concealed handgun-license holders. According to a fact-sheet posted on the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action&rsquo;s website in April, 40 states have laws allowing individuals to carry handguns, with Florida issuing more carry permits than any other state &mdash; 1.7 million. That&rsquo;s about 9 percent of Florida&rsquo;s 18.5 million-large population, according to a 2009 <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/12000.html\">estimate</a> by the Census Bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, 1.8 percent of the Texas population is licensed to carry a concealed handgun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Wentworth&rsquo;s statement as True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-24T13:26:42.236627", "ruling_date": "2011-03-17T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Jeff Wentworth says few Texans are licensed for concealed handguns", "ruling_headline_slug": "state-sen-jeff-wentworth-says-only-2-percent-texas", "ruling_link_text": "Bull's-eye ", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CNN,<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/bestoftv/2011/02/22/exp.am.intv.gun.cnn\"> Guns on campus?</a>, Feb. 22, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas Legislature Online, <a href=\"http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=82R&amp;Bill=SB354\">SB 354</a>, Relating to the carrying of concealed handguns on the campuses of institutions of higher education, filed Jan. 13, 2011, accessed Feb. 23, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/\">2010 Census data: Texas</a>, accessed Feb. 23, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/12000.html\">State &amp; County QuickFacts</a>: Florida, accessed Feb. 24, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Rifle Association,<a href=\"http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/fact-sheets/2010/right-to-carry-2010.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> Right-to-Carry 2010</u></a>, posted April 22, 2010, accessed Feb. 24, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Nicole Albers, administrative assistant for state Sen.
