We made appropriate changes. Our rating of the claim didn&#39;t change.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a tweet adorned with images of a rocket, a wind turbine, a steer, a factory and a microscope, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared: &quot;If Texas were a country, it would have the 10th highest GDP in the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If so, that&rsquo;s gained ground. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/dec/18/texas-petition/secession-petition-says-texas-has-15th-largest-eco/\">When we looked into a 2012 claim</a> comparing productivity in Texas versus the nations of the world, Texas ranked 14th internationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, we decided to put Abbott&rsquo;s statement to the Texas Truth-O-Meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fine print in Abbott&rsquo;s tweet states that it&#39;s based on information from Glenn Hegar, the Texas state comptroller, and from the International Monetary Fund and Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked, Lauren Willis of the comptroller&rsquo;s office emailed us <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r6LB0kav35_EjRRUd4wFcqUz40OTHVe0md5z-sLsbSA/edit?usp=sharing\">its chart</a> indicating that in 2015, Texas had a gross domestic product of $1.59 trillion -- placing it 10th among countries behind the U.S. ($17.95 trillion) and eight countries including Brazil ($1.77 trillion). The chart shows Texas ahead of No. 11 Canada ($1.55 trillion) as well as Korea, Russia, Australia, Spain, Mexico and four other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GDP, the most-used measure of national economic output, is<a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/glossary/glossary_g.htm\"> defined</a> as the market value of goods and services produced by labor and property in country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"090616 cpagdpchartpftexas.JPG\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/y3S0T68fIUfsCt2kQ7sQFlJTOQCIqKp7fTonqGMuOOeSBRuOjF6wme165CglajJtyaQst9pDkge2jsVTnPTB9b0h_67NKu4IlKePXRFepVYk7dUybtsSSWrWbKaqjs_PSH0JMZwp\" style=\"border:none; height:619px; width:544px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>SOURCE:</strong></em> Email, Lauren Willis, director of communications, Office of Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, Sept. 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For our part, we found 2015 <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c89iXPS0kz2ZiFcx61Aa7DuA_x5_AXLVtLJtEArel-8/edit?usp=sharing\">GDP figures posted in April 2016</a> by the International Monetary Fund matching the GDP figures in the comptroller&rsquo;s chart. Willis also pointed out a <a href=\"http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/GDP.pdf\">World Bank breakout</a> of GDPs by nation for 2015; the presented figures didn&rsquo;t perfectly align with the comptroller&rsquo;s chart, we found, though the ranking of the top 10 countries did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mHdH70-ovCRUKnv_O8MJZjUiqicyjIC5BTuC9ku0f4KWQ643MsTIbWWR5soypXz24Gm9NIRI8mO1oJcDoInj9hOo3cRlCfo06d8AbtVz3POmVAjrljLVX85cIcrHX9LpdUiviIU_\" style=\"border:none; height:279px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Willis also sent a web link to the bureau&rsquo;s U.S. and state-by-state GDP figures for 2015 and previous years. From the BEA, we downloaded figures indicating that in 2015, Texas had the GDP of $1.59 trillion that Abbott relied on. Then again, more populous California had a GDP of $2.46 trillion, which would have placed the Golden State No. 6 in the world if it were a nation, nudging Texas to No. 11. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/aug/17/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-california-besting-texas-creati/\">We recently found too</a> that California in 2015 had greater per-capita productivity than Texas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"090616 beagdpuscatxpftexas.JPG\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TH8GXIg-yg3cB6vmvRJ-Vjjhp4aHTYQ67yVu9IUSK7aRoRKyZJwAntCvd2h4Wi3CQw9BIltTjNE0mzby4IEu7r1x4AH4HIF6kBfIhWuaEhJC19xSOlzypMteCQ2ZtBQnOg6S4MZf\" style=\"border:none; height:227px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>SOURCE:</strong></em> Website, <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/regional/index.htm\">&quot;Regional Economic Accounts, Gross Domestic Product, Interactive Tables&quot;</a> Bureau of Economic Analysis, last updated June 14, 2016 (GDP figures downloaded Sept. 6, 2016)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbott said that if Texas were a country, its economy would rank 10th in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s so, figures show, if you leave out a bigger state, California.
