He asked his audience of 3,000 whether they heard what she said the other day, and they erupted into boos and guffaws.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;So she prefers the South African Constitution over the United States Constitution. A Supreme Court justice says we should be recommending to the world a South African view,&quot; Santorum told them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMore boos.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid she really say that?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Florida wrote about a similar accusation by that state&rsquo;s U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican. He said Ginsburg suggested that some U.S. cases will be decided based on South African law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Florida found that Rubio was referring to a recent interview she gave on Egyptian television in which she mentioned the South African Constitution. Our Florida counterparts watched it and found that her point didn&rsquo;t relate to decisions about U.S. cases at all. Rubio earned a False.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSantorum&rsquo;s claim is somewhat different. He accused Ginsburg of saying that she &quot;prefers&quot; the South African Constitution. We reviewed her statement to see whether Santorum was right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found she said no such thing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, some context.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter a popular uprising and the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, Egypt is in the midst of writing a new constitution. <a href=\"http://egypt.usembassy.gov/pr012812.html\">Ginsburg went to Egypt</a> in January to meet with Egyptian judges and legal experts, and while there gave an interview to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzog2QWiVaA\">Al Hayat TV</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMuch of the interview, which lasted about 15 minutes, focused on how Ginsburg would advise Egyptians to write their own constitution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGinsburg&rsquo;s lengthy, nuanced responses repeatedly praised the values, concepts and language of the U.S. Constitution and called the people who wrote it &quot;some of the most brilliant minds of the day &quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGinsburg warned that a constitution means &quot;nothing unless the people are yearning for liberty and freedom.&quot; She emphasized the importance of the U.S. Constitution&rsquo;s First Amendment and of the separation of powers between Congress, the president and the judiciary that it created. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGinsburg also pointed out that a long time had passed between the passage of the U.S. Constitution and Egypt&rsquo;s current efforts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I can&rsquo;t speak about what the Egyptian experience should be, because I&rsquo;m operating under a rather old constitution,&quot; Ginsburg said early in the interview. &quot;The United States in comparison to Egypt is a very new nation, and yet we have the oldest written constitution still enforced in the world. And it&rsquo;s a constitution that starts out with three wonderful words: &lsquo;We the people.&rsquo; &quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSouth Africa came up when Al Hayat asked whether Egypt should incorporate parts of other countries&rsquo; constitutions in its draft constitution.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Would your honor&rsquo;s advice be that a society like ours, with what we call -- what we like to call &nbsp;-- a transition to the second republic, would your honor&rsquo;s advice be to get part or use other countries&rsquo; constitutions? &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Maybe the United States or other countries as a model? Or [that] we come up with our own methods and our own draft?&quot; the interviewer asked.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGinsburg replied:<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t&quot;You should certainly be aided by all the constitution writing that has gone on since the end of World War II. I would not look to the U.S. Constitution if I were drafting a constitution in the year 2012. I might look at the constitution of South Africa.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That was a deliberate attempt to have a fundamental instrument of government that embraced basic human rights [and] had an independent judiciary. It really is, I think, a great piece of work that was done.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Much more recently than the U.S. Constitution is Canada, [which] has a charter of rights and freedoms [and] dates from 1982. You would almost certainly look at the European Convention on Human Rights. &hellip; I&#39;m a very strong believer in listening and learning from others.&#39;&#39;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt no point during the interview did Ginsburg say that she prefers the South African Constitution to the U.S. one. Her point was that it&rsquo;s better for Egypt to base its constitution on more recent ones written after Word War II. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSantorum claimed that Ginsburg said she &quot;prefers the South African Constitution over the United States Constitution.&quot; She never said that she did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat Ginsburg did do was give a nuanced opinion of what rights and concepts a good constitution should embody.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlthough Ginsburg said that Egypt should draw from newer constitutions, she made a concerted effort to praise key concepts of the U.S. Constitution, such as an independent judiciary and the ideas embodied by the words &quot;We the people.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSantorum&rsquo;s take on Ginsburg&rsquo;s comments twisted a handful of words to mean something that they did not.
