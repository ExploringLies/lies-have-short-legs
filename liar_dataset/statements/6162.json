The reason? Year by year, federal revenues haven&rsquo;t been keeping up with spending, due to the struggling national economy (which has held back tax revenues) and a continuation of tax cuts. And each year there&rsquo;s an annual deficit, the national debt grows.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat led to the frequently cited -- and wrongly exaggerated -- claim that the debt has increased more under Obama than under all previous 43 presidents combined.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt also led to this blog posting by Rep. Jim Renacci, the Republican incumbent facing Democratic incumbent Rep. Betty Sutton in Ohio&#39;s newly redrawn 16th congressional district:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In less than one term, (Obama has) racked up more debt than any president in history &mdash; over $5 trillion.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe statement interested PolitiFact Ohio because it was less sweeping and more specific than<br />\r\n\tmany others.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tResponding to our inquiry, Renacci&#39;s staff cited a CBS News story from March, which compared the debt growth under Obama&#39;s three years and two months in office to eight years under George W. Bush.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Jan. 20, 2009, the date Obama took office, the debt stood at $10.6 trillion. At the time of the CBS story, it had increased by $4.9 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy &nbsp;the day Renacci&#39;s statement was posted, the Treasury Department&#39;s online &quot;Debt to the Penny&quot; calculator showed the debt at more than $15.7 trillion -- an increase of $5.1 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring the two terms of the Bush presidency, whose debt exceeded all predecessors, the debt rose $4.899 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Renacci&#39;s numbers checked out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut Renacci&#39;s statement that Obama &quot;racked up&quot; the debt, fails to account for factors beyond Obama&#39;s control.<br />\r\n\tObama did approve the stimulus bill and a deal to extend tax cuts, both of which contributed to the debt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot surprising though, that Obama&rsquo;s Treasury Department blames most of the current debt on decisions made under Bush, including tax cuts (which it says cost the government $3 trillion), the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (which it tallies at $1.4 trillion) and the Medicare prescription drug program ($300 billion).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey may have a point that there is plenty of blame to spread around. It is clear that some elements of the increase in the debt are a result of decisions made before this administration took office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd it&rsquo;s worth noting that the president doesn&rsquo;t operate in a vacuum. Legislation that increases spending, such as the extension of the tax cuts, requires approval from Congress. In the case of the tax cuts, that support came from both Republicans and Democrats.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExperts note, too, that the weak economy has contributed to the debt, given the reduction in federal revenues and greater spending on items like unemployment benefits.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRenacci is accurate in asserting that the national debt has increased since Obama took office by more than $5 trillion, more than any previous administration.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut his statement assigns direct control -- and blame -- to Obama. Lost in that is the impact of the faltering economy, decisions made before Obama took office and the fact that others, such as Congress, also have had a role in increasing the debt.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, Renacci&rsquo;s claim rates Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-26T18:45:12.158247", "ruling_date": "2012-06-27T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Jim Renacci says Obama has racked up more debt than any other president", "ruling_headline_slug": "jim-renacci-says-obama-has-racked-more-debt-any-ot", "ruling_link_text": "Numbers are right, but is it all Obama's fault?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRep.
