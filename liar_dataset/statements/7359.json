But they discovered that, because of my illness, they couldn&rsquo;t find such a policy. Not from any insurer. Not at any price.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Never mind that I had fully recovered from my illness. I had been branded with the words &lsquo;pre-existing condition.&rsquo; My story, of course, isn&rsquo;t significant because it was unique. &nbsp;In fact, it&rsquo;s significant because it wasn&rsquo;t unique. When the Affordable Care Act was signed, 17 million American children wore that same brand. &nbsp;&lsquo;Pre-existing condition.&rsquo; Uninsurable.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen Obamacare became law, 17 million children were impossible to insure because they had a pre-existing health condition?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Baldwin&rsquo;s evidence</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nBaldwin&rsquo;s staff cited two pieces of evidence to back her claim.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne is a White House <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/healthreform/healthcare-overview\">fact sheet</a> that says that as a result of the Affordable Care Act, &quot;more than 17.6 million children with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied coverage.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut that&rsquo;s essentially a restatement of part of Baldwin&rsquo;s claim -- without any evidence that the figure is correct or that so many children were uninsurable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBaldwin also cited a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/news/reports/preexisting.html\">analysis</a>, the same one Obama cited in March 2012 when he said that because of the reform law, &quot;17 million kids can no longer be denied because of a pre-existing condition.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPolitiFact National rated his statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/16/barack-obama/barack-obama-film-says-health-care-law-aided-17-mi/\">Mostly False</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe analysis Obama and Baldwin cited focuses on people who could potentially be helped by the law if they found themselves uninsured in the future -- not on those who actually were uninsured and were blocked from getting coverage by pre-existing conditions today.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe federal analysis estimated that between 4 million and 17 million children have some type of pre-existing condition -- which means that like Obama, Baldwin cherry picked by citing the high end of that range. The higher figure also includes cases in which the child isn&rsquo;t actually denied insurance, but in which the family simply has to pay higher premiums.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPolitiFact National estimated, based on the analysis, that 160,000 to 1.1 million of the children with a pre-existing condition were uninsured because of the condition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile those are significant numbers, they are far below 17 million.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFactCheck.org also faulted Obama&rsquo;s statement, <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2012/03/obama-road-film-takes-some-detours/\">finding</a> that the 17 million part of the claim was on the high end. The claim also implied &quot;that these children were previously being denied coverage. But that&rsquo;s not the case,&quot; FactCheck.org said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBaldwin went further than Obama, not implying but declaring that 17 million children could not be insured.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nBaldwin said: &quot;When the Affordable Care Act was signed, 17 million American children&quot; had a pre-existing condition and were &quot;uninsurable.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s possible that as many as 17 million children have a pre-existing health condition, but the figure could be as low as 4 million. And only a fraction of children with a pre-existing condition&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t have insurance because of that condition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe rate Baldwin&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-02-08T15:11:33.498743", "ruling_date": "2013-02-11T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
