Scott Walker&rsquo;s proposed $300 million cut over two years to the University of Wisconsin System is adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;For UW-Madison it&rsquo;s a major issue,&quot; Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, said in a March 12, 2015 <a href=\"http://www.wiseye.org/videoplayer/vp.html?sid=12450\">Wisconsin Eye interview</a>. &quot;It&rsquo;s penny wise and pound foolish there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barca added: &quot;The average faculty member at UW-Madison brings in close to a quarter million dollars a year. So you cut them and they&rsquo;re leaving. They have plenty of opportunities to go to Harvard or Princeton or Stanford.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barca was joined on the Wisconsin Eye program by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester. He thinks the university cut is too large, but says Democrats are overreacting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Let&rsquo;s remember that the cut that&rsquo;s happening under Gov. Walker is about the size of the one that happened under (former Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat), and I didn&rsquo;t hear Democrats complaining about the loss of the university and how the world was going to come to an end.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll test Vos&rsquo; claim soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, let&rsquo;s examine Barca&rsquo;s statement about the prowess of the Madison faculty in attracting research grants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Researching the research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Barca to back up the claim, spokeswoman Laura Smith pointed to a <a href=\"http://budget.wisc.edu/faqs/\">page on the UW-Madison website</a> that answers frequently asked questions about the 2015-&rsquo;17 budget -- at least from the UW System&rsquo;s perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The page asserts that asking professors to teach more classes -- as Walker suggested -- would cut into critical functions of the university:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Research is central to their jobs. According to university statistics, each faculty member is bringing in approximately $242,000 on average to support their research in a highly competitive national environment. Faculty and staff brought in more than $500 million in federal research awards in 2012-13, money that would not otherwise come to Wisconsin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So there&rsquo;s Barca&rsquo;s &quot;close to a quarter million&quot; figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked UW-Madison about the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are from 2012-13, and were published in March 2014 in the <a href=\"http://apir.wisc.edu/datadigest/201314Digest/dd14_web.pdf\">university&rsquo;s &quot;Data Digest&quot;</a>. The document provides a detailed look at various aspects of the campus and is put together by three offices: Academic Planning &amp; Institutional Research, Office of the Provost and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Finance &amp; Administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UW-Madison is one of the leading research institutions in the country as measured by total grants from outside sources, mostly the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of its 2,173 faculty members, 1,275 (or 59 percent) secured research grants in 2012-13, the latest year available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So there&rsquo;s a point of clarification:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barca frames his claim around the idea that any cuts will hurt the university&rsquo;s ability to bring in research money. But in the year examined, 41 percent did not bring in grants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The university says it uses the total number of faculty when calculating the per-professor grant haul because all faculty members are expected to do research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In all, professors pulled in a total of $525.7 million in grants from outside sources. The grants are in these areas: biological sciences, humanities, physical sciences, social sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spread over 2,173 faculty, that&rsquo;s the $242,000 figure. If you spread it out over just the faculty receiving grants, the average is $412,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jocelyn Milner, a UW official who helps prepare the &quot;Data Digest,&quot; told us that grant productivity is calculated in another way as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s another $355 million in grants that are not awarded to individual professors, but to a dean or other official even though professors end up doing the research. When you add those in the per-faculty grant figure rises to $399,000 per year, Milner said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UW prefers the more conservative methodology that is behind the $241,935 figure, Milner said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that ranking universities on research prowess often turns on how much money they pull in. There are <a href=\"http://mup.asu.edu/Top-American-Research-Universities-2013-Annual-Report-MUP-2015-02-13.pdf\">other factors that can help judge research prominence</a>, such as journal articles published, endowment assets, faculty awards, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barca said, &quot;The average faculty member at UW-Madison brings in close to a quarter million dollars a year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He referred to research grants won. UW-Madison figures back up the claim, but there&rsquo;s one point of clarification, in that not all faculty get grants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Barca&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-03-20T12:54:42.878321", "ruling_date": "2015-03-23T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Does average UW-Madison faculty member bring in \"close to a quarter million\" a year in grant money?", "ruling_headline_slug": "does-average-uw-madison-faculty-member-bring-close", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, though many profs got no grants at all", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wisconsin Eye <a href=\"http://www.wiseye.org/videoplayer/vp.html?sid=12450\">interview</a>, Civil Dialogue show, March 12, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emails with Laura Smith, spokeswoman for Rep.
