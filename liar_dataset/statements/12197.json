But now a brouhaha has broken out between Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders over whether the other is qualified at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During an <a href=\"https://youtu.be/WrrnsbUX-yU\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>April 6 rally</u></a> at Temple University in Philadelphia, Sanders contended that in the wake of Clinton&#39;s loss in Wisconsin, she is getting a little nervous. &quot;And she has been saying lately that she thinks that I am, &#39;not qualified&nbsp;to be president,&rsquo; &quot; <a href=\"https://youtu.be/WrrnsbUX-yU?t=19m5s\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>he told the crowd</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders then said, &quot;I don&#39;t believe that she is qualified if she is, through her super PAC, taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest funds. I don&#39;t think that you are qualified if you get $15 million from Wall Street through your Super PAC. I don&#39;t think you are qualified if you have voted for the disastrous war in Iraq. I don&#39;t think you are qualified if you&#39;ve supported virtually every disastrous trade agreement, which has cost us millions of decent-paying jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, both candidates are clearly qualified in the strictest sense, because they both meet the four <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/elections/candid.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>constitutional requirements</u></a> to be president: age 35 or older, a natural born citizen, a resident for at least 14 years, and neither are finishing a second term in the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So is Sanders correct that Clinton has been saying the he was &quot;not qualified to be president&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We emailed his campaign asking where to find Clinton specifically and directly making that statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The campaign couldn&#39;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, the Sanders people sent us video of <a href=\"http://mms.tveyes.com/MediaCenterPlayer.aspx?u=aHR0cDovL21lZGlhY2VudGVyLnR2ZXllcy5jb20vZG93bmxvYWRnYXRld2F5LmFzcHg%2FVXNlcklEPTI5Njg2NiZNRElEPTYwMDMzOTAmTURTZWVkPTQzNyZUeXBlPU1lZGlh\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a Sanders news conference</u></a> in which he cites a CNN report saying that the Clinton campaign&#39;s strategy would be to &quot;Disqualify (Sanders), defeat him and unify the party later.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&#39;s not a quote from Clinton. It&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/06/politics/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-democrats-unity/index.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a summation</u></a> by CNN&#39;s senior Washington correspondent Jeff Zeleny, who begins his article this way: &quot;Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign is taking new steps to try and disqualify Bernie Sanders in the eyes of Democratic voters.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article says Clinton spokeswoman Christina Reynolds argued that Sanders is unqualified, but Reynolds is not directly quoted as saying that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, she is quoted as saying, &quot;You get the impression Sen. Sanders hasn&#39;t thought very much&quot; about how to actually get goals accomplished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders also cited <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/06/clinton-questions-whether-sanders-is-qualified-to-be-president/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a April 6 </u><em><u>Washington Post</u></em><u> headline</u></a>: &quot;Clinton questions whether Sanders is qualified to be president.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That headline comes from a story based on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TfQr5RmSUAE\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>an April 6 interview</u></a> with Clinton on the MSNBC show <em>Morning Joe,</em> in which host Joe Scarborough repeatedly tried to get Clinton to say whether she believed Sanders is &quot;qualified and ready&quot; to be president. In each case, Clinton wouldn&#39;t answer directly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, Clinton said Sanders&#39;&nbsp;interview with the New York<em> Daily News</em> &quot;raised a lot of really serious questions.&quot; In <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/transcript-bernie-sanders-meets-news-editorial-board-article-1.2588306\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the interview</u></a>, Sanders seemed <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/04/05/9-things-bernie-sanders-shouldve-known-about-but-didnt-in-that-daily-news-interview/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>to stumble</u></a> over details about how he would implement some of his proposals, such as breaking up big banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;So is he qualified?&quot; Scarborough said, asking if she thought Sanders was &quot;ready to be president.&quot; Clinton said she thought Sanders hadn&#39;t done his homework and &quot;that does raise a lot of questions.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scarborough tried again, asking &quot;But do you think he is qualified?&quot; Again, Clinton didn&#39;t give a yes or no answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lead paragraph on the <em>Washington Post</em> story: &quot;Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton on Wednesday questioned whether her rival in the Democratic presidential primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), is qualified to be president.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Clinton saying that Sanders&#39;&nbsp;answers raise questions about his qualifications is very different from saying he&#39;s &quot;not qualified.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders said Clinton &quot;has been saying lately that she thinks that I am &#39;not qualified&nbsp;to be president.&#39; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s the spin some media outlets are putting on it, when Clinton dodged the question of whether or not she thinks Sanders is qualified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But she&#39;s never directly said it, as Sanders specifically alleged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c946cee5-8369-47de-b43b-3945940259be\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c946cee5-8369-47de-b43b-3945940259be</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-04-07T15:18:19.479209", "ruling_date": "2016-04-07T16:05:34", "ruling_headline": "Did Hillary Clinton say Bernie Sanders 'not qualified' to be president?
