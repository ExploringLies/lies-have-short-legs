When can you think of ever in history where military commanders have said before a man or woman is elected that they would not follow his orders?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden has a point that Trump has advocated loosening laws on torture, including -- but not limited to -- waterboarding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just one example: Trump <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/06/politics/donald-trump-torture/\">said</a> on CBS&rsquo;s <em>Face the Nation</em> that the United States needs to&nbsp;&quot;strengthen the laws so that we can better compete&quot; with the brutal tactics of ISIS, and he dismissed the idea that allowing torture would be stooping to ISIS&#39; level. &quot;We have to play the game the way they&#39;re playing the game,&quot; Trump said. &quot;You&#39;re not going to win if we&#39;re soft.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, Trump has proposed killing the families of terrorists, a policy that, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/17/rand-paul/rand-pauls-right-geneva-conventions-bar-donald-tru/\">as we have written before</a>, would violate the Geneva Conventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Biden&rsquo;s remark suggests that active military commanders have already said before the election that they would not follow certain orders issued by Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s an overstatement, although one that contains some degree of truth. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who has said what about Trump so far?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could find no evidence -- and Biden&rsquo;s staff couldn&rsquo;t point to any -- showing active military commanders saying they would not follow certain orders from a President Trump. Typically, military officers do not comment on political matters while on active duty, in order to stay within the strictures of <a href=\"http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/134410p.pdf\">Defense Department Directive 1344.10</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senior national security retirees, though, are another story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden&rsquo;s staff pointed to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/02/cia-director-armed-forces-ignore-trump-219918\">comments</a> made in February by former CIA director Michael Hayden on HBO&#39;s <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pC7-RMhfSos\">Real Time with Bill Maher</a></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Maher brought up Trump&#39;s idea of killing family members of terrorists, Hayden said, &quot;If he were to order that once in government, the American armed forces would refuse to act.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maher responded, &quot;What? Well, that&rsquo;s quite a statement, sir.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, 50 senior Republican national security officials <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/08/us/politics/national-security-letter-trump.html\">signed a letter</a> on Aug. 8, 2016, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/national-security-gop-donald-trump.html?_r=0\">arguing</a> that Trump &quot;lacks the character, values and experience&quot; to be president and &quot;would put at risk our country&rsquo;s national security and well-being.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The letter did not explicitly say that the signers would personally refuse, or encourage active commanders to refuse, an illegal order from Trump. But the letter represented a sharp rebuke to Trump&rsquo;s fitness for office by members of his party&rsquo;s national security establishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should point out that Trump does have some senior military retirees on his side as well, including former Defense Intelligence Agency chief <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nearly-the-entire-national-security-establishment-has-rejected-trumpexcept-for-this-man/2016/08/15/d5072d96-5e4b-11e6-8e45-477372e89d78_story.html\">Michael T. Flynn</a>, decorated Army Maj. Gen. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-trump-foreign-policy-team-20160407-htmlstory.html\">Bert Mizusawa</a>, retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. <a href=\"https://markbircher.com/2016/07/28/gen-mark-bircher-announces-support-for-donald-trump/\">Mark Bircher</a>, retired four star Air Force Gen. <a href=\"http://kutv.com/news/local/trump-gets-official-presidential-backing-in-utah\">Robert Oaks</a>, and retired Army Maj. Gen. <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/obama/2016/03/29/gen-paul-vallely-trump-is-getting-support-because-gop-leadership-lacks-moral-courage-to-stand-up-against-obama/\">Paul Vallely</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom line: In his Scranton comments, Biden exaggerated by saying that current military commanders have publicly said &quot;they would not follow&quot; illegal orders from Trump. There&rsquo;s no evidence of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What does the law say?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, Biden&rsquo;s overstatement is somewhat moot -- because whether or not military commanders have publicly said in advance that they would refuse illegal orders, there&rsquo;s solid legal precedent that they should refuse an illegal order if one came their way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Under both international law and domestic law, a soldier has a duty to disobey a manifestly unlawful order,&quot; said Steven R. Ratner, a law professor at the University of Michigan. &quot;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who gave it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/MCM-2012.pdf\">Manual for Courts-Martial</a>, if &quot;an order is patently illegal, a service member has an obliga&shy;tion to disobey it,&quot; said Richard D. Rosen, director of the Texas Tech University&#39;s Center for Military Law &amp; Policy. The so-called &quot;Nuremberg Defense&quot; to criminal activity &mdash; &quot;I was only following orders&quot; &mdash; excuses a service &shy;member&rsquo;s crimi&shy;nal actions &quot;only if the ordered actions are not palpably illegal,&quot; Rosen said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This represents a pretty high standard. However, the types of orders at issue here -- such as the infliction of torture and the intentional killing of civilians -- would likely qualify, experts said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I believe that an order to target and kill civilians intentionally, such as killing the families of terrorists, is patently illegal, and I would advise commanders and soldiers not to follow the order,&quot; Rosen said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He cited the Vietnam War case of Lt. William Calley, a platoon leader who was accused of killing civilians, including women, children, and elderly men, in the village of My Lai in South Vietnam. Calley&rsquo;s defense was that he was executing the orders of his company commander, but both the Army Court of Military Review and Court of Military Appeals rejected Calley&rsquo;s defense, Rosen said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How unusual is the backlash against Trump?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, experts say Biden has a point about the unusual extent of senior military concern about a presidential candidate&rsquo;s potential for ordering illegal acts from the White House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There have certainly been overt disputes between presidents and commanders,&quot; such as between President Abraham Lincoln and Maj. Gen. George McClellan and between President Harry Truman and Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Rosen said. &quot;But I am not aware of cases in which active-duty servicemembers actually took sides in a political campaign.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anthony Clark Arend, a Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service, agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I can think of no historical precedent for members of the military and foreign policy community making statements relating to the need to disobey unlawful orders during a presidential campaign,&quot; Arend said. &quot;This truly seems unprecedented.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden said military commanders have said that if Trump were elected, &quot;they would not follow his orders.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden has a point that retired military officials have spoken out against Trump. But he exaggerated&nbsp;when he described them as &quot;military commanders.&quot; &nbsp;The current active leadership has not spoken out against Trump. We rate his statement Mostly False.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-17T17:50:31.126430", "ruling_date": "2016-08-17T18:37:07", "ruling_headline": "Joe Biden rips Donald Trump over commanders' fears about illegal orders", "ruling_headline_slug": "joe-biden-rips-donald-trump-over-commanders-fears-", "ruling_link_text": "Biden overstates the case", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Joe Biden, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7VSycMWG_E\">speech in Scranton, Pa.</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4941812?4\">Aug. 15, 2016</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/02/cia-director-armed-forces-ignore-trump-219918\">Ex-CIA director: Armed forces would ignore Trump</a>,&quot; Feb. 27, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/national-security-gop-donald-trump.html?_r=0\">50 G.O.P.
