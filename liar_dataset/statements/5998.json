Jack Kingston of Savannah poses a conundrum that may be as tough for some as choosing between God, America and apple pie. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFiscal conservatism or NASCAR?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKingston recently backed a successful amendment to a defense bill that would block the military from spending millions of federal dollars on sponsorships for pro sports teams. He thinks the money should support service members instead.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf the defense bill passes as amended, it would end the U.S. National Guard&rsquo;s sponsorship of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEarnhardt resorted to fightin&rsquo; words.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe day after the amendment passed, he told reporters that Kingston needed to do his &quot;homework&quot; on how sponsorships attract military recruits.<br />\r\n\t<br class=\"kix-line-break\" />\r\n\t&quot;The Republican from Georgia, he hasn&rsquo;t even been to a NASCAR race,&quot; Earnhardt told reporters May 18 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway, according to an article in The Sporting News. Other news outlets posted similar accounts of his statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s almost as bad as calling Kingston a &quot;Yankee.&quot; Could this be true?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe effort to end military sponsorships of professional sports is a bipartisan affair. Democratic U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota offered the amendment, which passed May 17, alongside Kingston.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to Kingston&rsquo;s office, the Defense Department plans to spend as much as $80.3 million on this type of recruitment advertising this fiscal year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOther NASCAR drivers are on the military payroll. The U.S. Army backs Ryan Newman. The Air Force sponsors Aric Almirola.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo Earnhardt, these partnerships are a no-brainer. Kingston is out of line.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWatching NASCAR is as essential to being a Republican politician from the South as going to church or kissing babies.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA reporter at Charlotte Motor Speedway asked Earnhardt whether he would invite Kingston to a NASCAR race.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Yes, because he&rsquo;s a Republican from Georgia,&quot; Earnhardt said, according to The Sporting News article. &quot;He ought to have seen a NASCAR race by now.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe called Kingston&rsquo;s offices repeatedly for more than a week but received no response. Earnhardt&rsquo;s office didn&rsquo;t return our calls either. We therefore searched far and wide for evidence that Kingston had attended a NASCAR race.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMaybe we&rsquo;d find a photograph of the gentleman from Georgia shaking hands with Jeff Gordon or watching the Daytona 500 from the infield, perched on a folding chair atop an RV.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInstead, we found him at just about everything but NASCAR.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe spotted Kingston on HBO&rsquo;s &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; last year, being berated by the liberal comedian for being a creationist.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne year before that, Kingston rubbed elbows with President Barack Obama in Air Force One as they flew from Savannah to Washington.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd three years ago he appeared on the set of the Miley Cyrus movie &quot;The Last Song.&quot; He was an extra for the film, which featured scenes on Tybee Island.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo our surprise, we also found three news accounts that said Earnhardt was right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Hill, a newspaper that covers Congress, said in a May 18 article that Kingston&rsquo;s office confirmed that he has never attended a NASCAR race. A May 17 article in USA Today said Kingston himself acknowledged it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA May 22 story in the Savannah Morning News says that Kingston&rsquo;s never been to a race, but he did display an Earnhardt license plate on the front of his pickup for five years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s strange but true. Kingston has never been to a NASCAR race.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEarnhardt earns a True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-29T16:42:44.025643", "ruling_date": "2012-05-30T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Dale Earnhardt Jr. accuses congressman of never attending NASCAR races", "ruling_headline_slug": "dale-earnhardt-jr-accuses-congressman-never-attend", "ruling_link_text": "Strange but true", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tSporting News, &quot;<a href=\"http://aol.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2012-05-18/dale-earnhardt-jr-national-guard-ryan-newman-us-army-military-sponsorships#ixzz1vtXJNF7g\">Dale Earnhardt Jr. invites congressman to NASCAR race to learn more about military sponsorships</a>,&quot; May 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSavannah Morning News, &quot;<a href=\"http://savannahnow.com/sports/2012-05-22/kingstons-plan-includes-stripping-nascar-military-funds#.T753WFLYBI5\">Kingston&#39;s plan includes stripping NASCAR of military funds</a>,&quot; May 22, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Birmingham News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2012/05/dale_earnhardt_jr_not_happy_th.html\">Dale Earnhardt Jr. not happy that some in Congress want to cut military spending on NASCAR sponsorships</a>,&quot; May 18, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUSA Today, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/story/2012-05-17/House-defense-bill-would-cut-NASCAR-sponsorships/55040336/1\">House committee vote squashes military NASCAR sponsorships</a>,&quot; May 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSavannah Morning News, &quot;<a href=\"http://m.savannahnow.com/news/2010-03-03/savannah-welcomes-president-barack-obama\">Savannah welcomes President Barack Obama,</a>&quot; March 3, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWTOC-TV, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wtoc.com/Global/story.asp?s=10575993&amp;clienttype=printable\">Miley fans swarm Tybee pier</a>,&quot; June 24, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Huffington Post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/30/jack-kingston-evolution_n_815909.html\">Jack Kingston: &#39;I Came From God Not From A Monkey</a>,&rsquo;&quot; Jan. 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Rep.
