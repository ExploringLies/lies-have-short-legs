The Clinton Foundation gives less than 10 (percent). In 2013, they raised 140 million bucks, gave 9 million to people in direct aid,&quot; Castellanos <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-september-4-2016-n642656\">said</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve heard various versions of this claim (from former GOP presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2015/06/where-does-clinton-foundation-money-go/\">Carly Fiorina</a>, conservative radio host <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/29/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-clinton-foundation-spends-just-/\">Rush Limbaugh</a> and RNC chairman <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/25/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-false-claim-80-clinton-foundation-c/\">Reince Priebus</a>). It&rsquo;s misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Castellanos&rsquo; numbers don&rsquo;t take into account the bulk of the foundation&#39;s work. The foundation does spend a lot of money on charity, not through grantmaking, but through its own programming.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/sites/default/files/clinton_foundation_report_public_2013_amended.pdf\">Tax returns</a> show the Clinton Foundation raised just under $143 million and spent about $85 million, including $9 million in grants to other organizations.&nbsp;But that does not include all of the foundation&#39;s charitable work</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Grantmaking is not part of its <a href=\"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/about\">mission</a>, and that creates confusion &mdash; since many people imagine that foundations are engaged in giving away money,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2016/6/23/what-the-heck-does-the-clinton-foundation-actually-do.html\">writes</a> David Callahan, editor of <em>Inside Philanthropy.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite its name, the Clinton Foundation is not actually a private foundation (like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or the Donald J. Trump Foundation) that solely gives to philanthropic causes. Rather, it&rsquo;s a public charity, like United Way or the Salvation Army, that runs its own in-house projects and hires staff to carry out the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton Foundation programs include providing <a href=\"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/our-work/clinton-giustra-enterprise-partnership/programs/peru-acceso-chakipi\">women in Peru</a> with the tools and equipment to launch their own businesses, installing <a href=\"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/our-work/clinton-foundation-haiti/programs/powering-haiti-clean-energy\">solar panels and grids in Haiti</a> after the earthquake, <a href=\"http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/sep/06/clinton-foundation-tanzania-work-farmers/\">helping farmers in Tanzania</a> boost yields and turn a profit, and using market mechanisms to <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/global-news/statements/2016/jun/15/hillary-clinton/clinton-clinton-foundation-helped-9-million-lower-/\">reduce the cost of HIV/AIDS medicine.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All together, these programs cost $68 million in 2013 (<a href=\"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/sites/default/files/clinton_foundation_report_public_2013_amended.pdf\">page 10</a> of the foundation&rsquo;s tax documents for that year), or about 80 percent of all of the foundation&#39;s expenses that year. In 2014, programs were 87 percent of the Clinton Foundation&rsquo;s expenses, <a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=16680\">according to Charity Navigator</a>, giving it a score of 10 out of 10 on that metric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a more detailed breakdown of the foundation&rsquo;s 2013 expenses:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"624\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//e.infogr.am/c3e08b06-a8df-4c96-833d-560236bbbd29?src=embed\" style=\"border:none;\" title=\"\" width=\"700\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In sum, Castellanos&rsquo; claim is &quot;totally wrong,&quot; Callahan of <em>Inside Philanthropy</em> told PolitiFact. &quot;The vast majority of the money raised goes to support program work in the field, as anyone can tell from looking at the Clinton Foundation&rsquo;s annual finances.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Castellanos did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Castellanos said, &quot;The Clinton Foundation gives less than 10&nbsp;(percent in direct aid).
