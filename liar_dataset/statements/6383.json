In the 2012 campaign Neumann is running on a platform to balance the budget on a <a href=\"http://neumann2012.com/issues/spending-and-balance-the-budget-i/\">five-year plan</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA look at the votes shows they came as Neumann and other conservatives pushed the Democratic president for significant spending cuts. Compromise talks failed, leading, famously, to two temporary government shutdowns.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe 1995 votes were part of the legislative battle over the GOP&rsquo;s balanced budget act, which aimed to accomplish a balanced budget in seven years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn fact, in three of the four votes Hovde cites, the debt-limit increase was part of very broad fiscal measures.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe March 1996 debt action, for example, was tucked into a multifaceted bill to reduce federal regulation of business, and as we noted it drew significant Democratic support.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, the August 1997 increase in the debt limit was approved as part of an act the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/26/us/house-and-senate-pass-legislation-to-balance-budget.html\">New York Times </a><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/26/us/house-and-senate-pass-legislation-to-balance-budget.html\">described </a>as &quot;sweeping legislation intended to balance the federal budget for the first time since 1969.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe government actually ran a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/16/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-repeats-claim-about-his-record-balan/\">surplus from 1998 to 2001</a>, thanks to what observers said was a combination of an earlier tax increase, spending restraints, economic growth and stock market gains.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tForeshadowing the 2011 showdown, Neumann, an early <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/03/magazine/adventures-of-a-republican-revolutionary.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm\">crusader on the perils of debt</a>, was trying to leverage the deadline over raising the debt ceiling to get deeper spending cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat sounds a lot like Hovde&rsquo;s position, which he laid out at a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPpXVJ1lFQk&amp;feature=youtu.be\">candidate forum in April </a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPpXVJ1lFQk&amp;feature=youtu.be\">2012.&nbsp;
