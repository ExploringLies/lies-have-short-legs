Michele Bachmann cited a comment that she said Apple CEO Steve Jobs made in a meeting with President Obama. She said Jobs &quot;said to President Barack Obama that he had to move a great deal of his operation over to China because he couldn&#39;t find 30,000 engineers to be able to do the work that needed to be done. That&#39;s what we want to do.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJobs&#39; two meetings with Obama in 2010 and 2011 are detailed in the new biography of the Apple leader by author Walter Isaacson.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe book recounts the first meeting occurred at a hotel at the San Francisco airport in the fall of 2010. Isaacson, relying on accounts from White House aides and Jobs himself, wrote that Jobs told Obama bluntly, &quot;You&#39;re headed for a one-term presidency&quot; and urged the Democratic president to be more business-friendly. Jobs told Obama how easy it was to build a factory in China, in contrast to the difficulties caused by regulations and extra costs in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIsaacson&#39;s book says Jobs offered to put together a group of CEOs for another meeting, which was held early this year.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJobs, who died Oct. 5, 2011, was looking thin and frail because of his cancer but still managed to be passionate about the need for more engineers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;When Jobs&#39; turn came,&quot; Isaacson wrote, &quot;he stressed the need for more trained engineers and suggested that any foreign students who earned an engineering degree in the United States should be given a visa to stay in the country.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe book says that&nbsp; &quot;Jobs went on to urge that a way be found to train more American engineers. Apple had 700,000 factory workers employed in China, he said, and that was because it needed 30,000 engineers on-site to support those workers. &#39;You can&#39;t find that many in America to hire,&#39; he said. These factory engineers did not have to be PhDs or geniuses; they simply needed to have basic engineering skills for manufacturing. Tech schools, community colleges, or trade schools could train them.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;&#39;If you could educate these engineers,&#39; he said, &#39;we could move more manufacturing plants here.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIsaacson wrote that the argument &quot;made a strong impression on the president. Two or three times over the next month he told his aides, &#39;We&#39;ve got to find ways to train those 30,000 manufacturing engineers that Jobs told us about.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo Bachmann has accurately recounted the conversation.
