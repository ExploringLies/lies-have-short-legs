years have experienced the smallest rate increases of the last 14 years. Throughout much of the early 2000s, premium increases of 9 percent or more were the norm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid also found a slowdown in the increase in health costs during the last four years, including a modest 4 percent increase from 2011 to 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government attributed the decrease in health costs to the economic downturn. <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-costs/perspective/health-cost-growth-is-down-or-not-it-depends-who-you-ask/\"><u>Kaiser</u></a>, too, said the recession accounted for much of the decline, though they said the health care law may have played a role, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the law, people making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level are now eligible for subsidies to buy insurance, and for many of them, costs are going down.<strong> </strong>Those costs are capped at a percent of their income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But some people may see rate increases on existing policies or as they transition to new plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurers can no longer deny individuals with pre-existing conditions, and there is now a much larger pool of people looking to purchase coverage. For younger, healthier people, this means they are now taking on some of the financial burden so older or sick people can buy insurance at a reasonable price. (This is especially true for young males, since young women were often charged more, and even more so if they don&rsquo;t qualify for premium subsidies.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were also people who previously purchased very cheap plans. But those policies provided very little coverage or capped their benefits at low levels, which the new health care law bars. So they&rsquo;re getting more coverage, albeit at a greater cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Getting less?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which gets us to our next point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found it strange that the ad claimed that people are getting less under the Affordable Care Act. In fact, we&rsquo;ve usually heard the opposite from critics of the law that people are now paying for types of coverage they don&rsquo;t need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The favorite example is single men who now will now have maternity coverage if they buy a plan on the individual market. In October 2013, Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C., grilled Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius on this very point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;An insurance policy has a series of benefits whether you use them or not,&quot; Sebelius said during her testimony on the Hill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And that is why the health care premiums are increasing this high,&quot; Ellmers said. &quot;We&rsquo;re forcing them to buy things that they will never need.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Individual policies cover families. Men often do need maternity coverage for their spouses and for their families,&quot; Sebelius responded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To the best of your knowledge, has a man ever delivered a baby?&quot; Elmers asked. The discussion ended there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So are you getting less coverage, or getting more than you need? We asked Americans for Prosperity to clarify their position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Getting less speaks to a multitude of data points that has been America&#39;s Obamacare experience so far: botched website, shrinking provider networks, a string of broken promises, missed deadlines, and unilateral rule changes that have kept the entire country in limbo ever since this debacle rolled out,&quot; said spokesman Levi Russell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty ambiguous definition of &quot;less.&quot; We think most people would assume &quot;less&quot; is referring to the amount of coverage or benefits under the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americans are getting more benefits under the law in a number of ways -- including, in some cases, being able to buy affordable insurance for the first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, insurance purchased in the individual and small group marketplace must meet 10 essential health benefits. This includes coverage for emergency services and hospitalization, prescription drugs, free preventative coverage for things ranging from basic immunizations to HIV screening, and maternity care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law also caps out-of-pocket costs, providing greater protection from exorbitant hospital bills. The most a person could pay for health care in a year is $6,300; the most a family can pay is $12,600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the law passed, some insurers capped annual or lifetime benefits, forcing people who thought they were covered to pay large hospital bills once they passed the threshold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People with pre-existing conditions are also seeing a lot more benefits, since they previously couldn&rsquo;t buy a policy at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it&rsquo;s a tough sell to say millions are getting less. And for many, they aren&rsquo;t paying more, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americans for Prosperity said &quot;millions are paying more and getting less&quot; under Obamacare. We found their explanation of &quot;less&quot; rather dubious. Most people on the individual market are getting more benefits under the law.
