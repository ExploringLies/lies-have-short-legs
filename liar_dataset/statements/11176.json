Chris Christie wanted everyone at the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 cycle to know that he has experience prosecuting terrorists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When debate moderator Megyn Kelly asked him about Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul&#39;s position on the National Security Agency&#39;s bulk collection of Americans&#39; phone records, he immediately invoked the worst terrorist attack on American soil in the country&#39;s history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on Sept. 10, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said that meant he had unique experience as &quot;the only person on this stage who&#39;s actually filed applications under the PATRIOT Act&quot; as well as having &quot;prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after Sept. 11.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His comment started a back-and-forth with Paul, who spent more than 10 hours on the Senate floor in May protesting the PATRIOT Act. Christie characterized Paul&rsquo;s experience as: &quot;sitting in a subcommittee, just blowing hot air about this....&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christie&rsquo;s line about becoming the U.S attorney for New Jersey the day before 9/11 is similar to statements he&rsquo;s made while campaigning in New Hampshire. We wondered: Is it true?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few of our PolitiFact readers were quick to point out a report published in the <em>New York Times</em> on Dec. 8, 2001, which said that on the day before &ndash; nearly four months after the terrorist attacks &ndash; President George Bush announced he would nominate Christie as the next U.S. attorney for New Jersey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article notes, however, that the nomination had been &quot;expected for months.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others pointed to a White House press release dated Dec. 7, 2001, saying the president &quot;intends to nominate&quot; Christie as the next U.S. attorney for New Jersey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That doesn&rsquo;t appear to jibe with Christie&rsquo;s claim that he was &quot;appointed&quot; on Sept. 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contacted Christie&rsquo;s campaign in New Hampshire for clarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spokeswoman for Christie, Samantha Smith, wrote in an email Friday that Christie received a phone call on Sept. 10, 2001, from Attorney General John Ashcroft that set in motion a months-long hiring process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The point he was making was on Sept. 10 he accepted the job,&quot; Smith said in a phone interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith pointed to an article in New Jersey&#39;s <em>Star-Ledger</em> newspaper from Sept. 11, 2001, which read: &quot;President Bush nominated former Morris County freeholder Christopher Christie as the state&#39;s next U.S. attorney yesterday.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It continues: &quot;...the White House notified Christie that he is the President&#39;s choice and that extensive background checks on his qualifications would begin immediately.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story, written by Kate Coscarelli and Robert Cohen, estimated that those checks would take &quot;up to six weeks, after which the formal nomination would be put forth to the Senate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christie was officially confirmed by the U.S. senate on Dec. 20, 2001, and sworn into office on Jan. 17, 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christie unequivocally stated twice that he was appointed on Sept. 10. Given free rein to choose his closing remarks, he circled back to the same story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was appointed United States attorney on September 10, 2001. And I spent the next seven years of my career fighting terrorism and putting terrorists in jail,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Christie stood on stage, he gave the impression that he took the job as U.S. attorney the day before the terrorist attacks and then he &quot;prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after Sept. 11.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the word &quot;appoint&quot; has more than one meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Merriam-Webster says the word can mean &quot;to fix or set officially,&quot; or &quot;to name officially.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other definitions use verbs like &quot;assign&quot; and &quot;choose.&quot; If that&rsquo;s your interpretation, then Christie is closer to correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, the impression Christie left with the debate&rsquo;s viewers was that he was in charge of prosecuting and investigating terrorists immediately following the Sept. 11 attacks. That&rsquo;s misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christie&rsquo;s spokeswoman insisted that his point stood: The world was a different place after 9/11, and in that new world, Christie navigated the laws and brought terrorists to justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christie said, &quot;I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on Sept. 10, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christie said he received a phone call on Sept. 10, 2001, that began the process of his appointment as the U.S. attorney for New Jersey. However, he wasn&rsquo;t nominated until months later, and he was sworn into the position until the following year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4773c653-58b6-4f55-8158-c8b3e83ab0db\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4773c653-58b6-4f55-8158-c8b3e83ab0db</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-08-07T19:42:50.215816", "ruling_date": "2015-08-07T19:40:13", "ruling_headline": "Christie says he was 'appointed' U.S. attorney the day before Sept. 11 attacks", "ruling_headline_slug": "christie-says-he-was-appointed-be-us-attorney-day-", "ruling_link_text": "Official nomination came later", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d46sdVMreNg\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>1st 2016 Presidential GOP Republican Prime Time Debate [Part 1 of 2]</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The New York Times, &quot;</em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/08/nyregion/corporate-lawyer-in-new-jersey-is-chosen-as-federal-prosecutor.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Corporate Lawyer in New Jersey Is Chosen as Federal Prosecutor</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 8, 2001</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House, &quot;<a href=\"http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/12/20011207-9.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Nominations</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 7, 2001</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Star-Ledger, </em>&quot;Law panel says Bush&#39;s choice lacks experience,&quot; Sept. 11, 2001</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Samantha Smith, spokeswoman for Christie, Aug. 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 10, "current_job": "Governor of New Jersey", "false_count": 17, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 27, "home_state": "New Jersey", "id": 1251, "last_name": "Christie", "mostly_true_count": 19, "name_slug": "chris-christie", "pants_count": 8, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/christie.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1251/", "total_count": 105, "true_count": 21, "website": "http://www.state.nj.us/governor/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on Sept. 10, 2001.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "comments in a GOP debate in Cleveland", "statement_date": "2015-08-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 302, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/302/", "subject": "Debates", "subject_slug": "debates", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/47/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/14/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/", "/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 173, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/173/", "subject": "Public Safety", "subject_slug": "public-safety", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/9/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 37, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/37/", "subject": "Terrorism", "subject_slug": "terrorism", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
