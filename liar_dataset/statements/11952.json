Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Nov. 20, 2015, soon after the House passed a bill that would increase security checks on refugees from Iraq and Syria, Grothman appeared on conservative talker Jay Weber&rsquo;s show on WISN (1130-AM). In the appearance, he asserted President Barack Obama has basically an open-door policy when it comes to immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Whether it&rsquo;s dealing with the Middle East or south of the border, Barack Obama is apparently not for vetting people and saying just anybody can come here and we&rsquo;ll see what happens,&quot; said Grothman, R-Campbellsport. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Grothman made his statement in the context of the Syrian refugee bill, we&rsquo;ll evaluate the claim with that in mind. Obama plans to accept about 10,000 people from Syria in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Refugee process</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama has said Syrian refugees coming into United States must follow the same vetting process as all other refugees. But Republicans argue that is not enough and more stringent background checks are necessary, given concerns about terrorists posing as refugees and slipping into the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/11/20/infographic-screening-process-refugee-entry-united-states\">vetting process</a> for those seeking refuge in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those seeking refuge must find a United Nations Refugee Agency and identify themselves as a refugee. The U.N. collects data on the applicant, such as their date and place of birth. Applicants are interviewed to confirm need for resettlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Refugees from active war zones, including Syria, already must undergo additional checks, such as iris scans that are checked against terrorist databases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The White House says less than <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/11/20/infographic-screening-process-refugee-entry-united-states\">1 percent</a> of the global refugee population is considered strong candidates to be admitted to the United States and make it past this first check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, applicants are received by a federally funded Resettlement Support Center overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An applicant file is created with identifying documents and security checks conducted. Candidates are screened by at least four U.S. security agencies -- National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department. The agencies check for security risks, such as ties to known bad actors, and criminal history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The process continues with a Homeland Security interview; those from Syria get an &quot;enhanced review,&quot; which means their documents are scrutinized more closely. Fingerprints are taken and screened against federal databases. A medical screening occurs. Cultural orientation classes are taken. Travel is booked. Finally, the refugees arrives in the United States. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. officials will eliminate any candidate who intelligence does not think will make a good candidate to enter the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Any doubt, they&rsquo;re out,&quot; said Melanie Nezer, vice president of policy and advocacy for the refugee assistance group HIAS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Grothman&rsquo;s backup</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grothman&rsquo;s team sent a series of links to news articles and quotes from federal officials as evidence of Obama&rsquo;s stance on refugees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The idea that somehow they pose a more significant threat than all the tourists who pour into the United States every single day just doesn&rsquo;t jive with reality,&quot; Obama said in <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/19/remarks-president-obama-and-prime-minister-trudeau-canada-after\">his remarks</a> after a meeting with the Canadian prime minister Nov. 19, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grothman also included a quote from FBI Director James Comey&rsquo;s congressional testimony in October 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If we don&rsquo;t know much about somebody, there won&rsquo;t be anything in our data,&quot; Comey said. &quot;I can&rsquo;t sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that there&rsquo;s no risk associated with this.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Comey didn&rsquo;t say the system is failing, or that no vetting occurs. Only that it is impossible to identify every potential problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;James Comey doesn&rsquo;t have the power of absolute foresight,&quot; said Antonio Ginatta, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;No level of vetting would get you to 100 percent.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grothman said, &quot;Barack Obama is apparently not for vetting people and saying just anybody can come&quot; to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But refugees are the most vetted people who enter the country -- and Syrian refugees already &nbsp;face additional measures. What&rsquo;s more, Grothman&rsquo;s evidence didn&rsquo;t back up his claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-22T15:31:15.427390", "ruling_date": "2016-02-26T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Rep.
