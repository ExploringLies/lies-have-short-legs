-- in other words, curbing the rights of injured people to sue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Shockingly,&quot; Kraig added, &quot;<a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/MedicalDevicesBill+11-28902.pdf\">one </a><a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/MedicalDevicesBill+11-28902.pdf\">bill</a> in the current session dangerously grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity from injuries and deaths caused by their products.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tImmunity from lawsuits -- even in cases of injury and death?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill Kraig criticized was proposed by <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rich-zipperer/\">Sen. Rich Zipperer</a>, R-City of Pewaukee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs long as a drug or device is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the manufacturer or seller of that drug or medical device would be immune from liability, <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/MedicalDevicesBill+11-28902.pdf\">according</a> to the non-partisan Legislative Reference Bureau.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tZipperer spokewoman Hannah Huffman said, however, that there are exceptions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tImmunity would not apply if FDA approval were gained through fraud, she said. And although manufacturers could not be sued for a defect in the design of a drug or device if the design had been approved by the FDA, the manufacturer could be sued if it failed to follow the design in the manufacturing process, she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.center4research.org/about-us/key-staff/\">Diana Zuckerman</a>, president of the <a href=\"http://www.center4research.org/about-us/\">National Research Center for Women &amp; </a><a href=\"http://www.center4research.org/about-us/\">Families</a> in Washington, D.C., told us she believes the immunity bill would apply to all drugs but perhaps not to all medical devices. Zuckerman, who has done research on the FDA approval processes, said it would depend on how the word approved is interpreted in the bill. Every year, only about 3 percent of new medical devices gain FDA approval, while the rest are &quot;cleared&quot; under a less-stringent process by the agency, she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Zipperer&rsquo;s bill gives broad immunity, with some exceptions, to drug makers but perhaps less immunity to device makers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Kraig for evidence to back what essentially was a blanket statement that the bill &quot;grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKraig initially said his statement was &quot;over broad and should have included the qualification that this bill covers drugs and medical devices approved by the FDA.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLater he argued the statement was fair because most people, when they hear a reference to drug makers or medical device manufacturers, would understand that those companies make products that in the vast majority of cases must be approved by the FDA.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKraig also argued that the bill is dangerous because in recent years the FDA&rsquo;s regulatory powers have been weakened and therefore its approval of a drug or device does not provide as much protection as it once did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs evidence, he cited a <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/Michigan+Drug+Immunity.pdf\">report</a> that is critical of a Michigan law that gives immunity to drug manufacturers and that Kraig said is similar to the drug manufacturers part of the Wisconsin&rsquo;s bill. And he cited a national <a href=\"http://www.justice.org/clips/TheyKnewAndFailedTo.pdf\">report</a> on problems people encountered after using drugs and medical devices that had received FDA approval.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut arguing a bill is unnecessary or unwise does not get at the question we are examining: Whether the bill does what Kraig said it does in terms of immunity.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our conclusion</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKraig said a bill proposed by a Wisconsin lawmaker &quot;grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity from injuries and deaths caused by their products.&quot; He acknowledged that his statement was &quot;over broad,&quot; in that immunity applies only when FDA approval has been granted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bill doesn&rsquo;t give blanket protection to drug and device makers. But its primary intent is to give them immunity, with some exceptions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Kraig&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-10-13T11:00:38.665594", "ruling_date": "2011-10-14T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Health care advocate says Wisconsin bill would give drug makers immunity from lawsuits over injury or death", "ruling_headline_slug": "health-care-advocate-says-wisconsin-bill-would-giv", "ruling_link_text": "Not blanket protection", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCitizen Action of Wisconsin, <a href=\"http://citizenactionwi.org/no-sacred-cows-blog/476-absurd-jobs-claims-not-an-excuse-to-damage-wisconsins-civil-justice-rights.html\">No Sacred Cows Blog</a>, Oct. 3, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview and email interview, <a href=\"http://citizenactionwi.org/\">Citizen Action of </a><a href=\"http://citizenactionwi.org/\">Wisconsin</a> executive director <a href=\"http://citizenactionwi.org/staff/staff-profile.html\">Robert Kraig</a>, Oct. 7 and 10, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Gov.
