I believe we are now the largest city in the United States ever to have an African-American mayor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is that so?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We emailed Cisneros asking how he reached his assessment and also reached out to the Washington, D.C.-based National League of Cities, <a href=\"http://www.nlc.org/about-nlc\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>which describes itself</u></a> as a research and advocacy group for 19,000 municipalities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A league administrator, Jim Brooks, responded by phone, noting first that because San Antonio is among the nation&rsquo;s 10 most-populous cities, this claim has a limited scope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of July 1, 2012, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGcDhiMU1mV2MtTFk/edit?usp=sharing\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>according to the U.S Census Bureau</u></a>, San Antonio&rsquo;s nearly 1.4 million residents placed it seventh nationally in population behind New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia and Phoenix. (It&#39;s worth keeping in mind the bureau&#39;s city population estimates don&#39;t take into account surrounding metro areas.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brooks said Baltimore, Md., has an African American woman as mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, initially sworn in Feb. 4, 2010, according to a <a href=\"http://mayor.baltimorecity.gov/biography\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>City of Baltimore web page</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brooks noted, too, that Shirley Franklin, an African American, is the former mayor of Atlanta. Franklin, who now teaches at the LBJ School of Public Affairs, <a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/directory/faculty/shirley-franklin\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>was Atlanta&rsquo;s mayor</u></a> from 2002 to 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of those cities is home to far fewer residents than San Antonio. As of July 2012, according to the bureau, Baltimore had about 622,000 residents; Atlanta was home to an estimated 443,000-plus residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on his 25 years working on city issues, Brooks said, he was unaware of mayors who would disprove Cisneros&rsquo; statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached another person with perspective, <a href=\"http://nationalcongressbw.org/about-the-chairperson\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>E. Faye Williams</u></a>, the president/ceo of the National Congress of Black Women. Williams said by phone the cities larger than San Antonio haven&rsquo;t had African American female mayors. She also suggested we mention Sharon Pratt Kelly, the mayor of Washington, D.C., from 1991 through 1994, according to a February 2014 <a href=\"http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/dc-city-council-members-from-1975-to-2013/index.php\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>compilation</u></a> of city leaders by Washingtonian magazine. The district&rsquo;s estimated population as of July 2012 exceeded 633,000, the bureau says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By telephone, Cisneros noted another mayor we hadn&rsquo;t already tallied, Sharon Sayles Belton, who led Minneapolis from 1994 to 2002, according to a 2013 <a href=\"http://theuptake.org/2013/10/21/former-minneapolis-mayor-sharon-sayles-belton-to-solve-city-problems-make-sure-everyone-gets-invited-to-the-table/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>web post</u></a> by The Uptake, an online news operation. That city&rsquo;s estimated population as of July 2012 was nearly 400,000, the bureau says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cisneros said San Antonio is the largest U.S. city to ever have a female African American mayor.
