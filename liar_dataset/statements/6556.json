That earned a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/20/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-he-didnt-inherit-money-his-parent/\">Half True</a>, because he previously <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/edwindurgy/2012/05/17/an-inside-look-at-the-millions-mitt-romney-has-given-away/\">told interviewers</a> he did get an inheritance, but donated it to Brigham Young University.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis time we&rsquo;re checking whether he &quot;gave away his father&rsquo;s inheritance.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;re short on primary evidence for the claim &mdash; we haven&rsquo;t seen his father&rsquo;s will, nor a receipt from Brigham Young. But there&rsquo;s a strong circumstantial case that Priebus is correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Rich get richer</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorge Romney died in 1995 at age 88. By that time, his son had led Bain Capital, the private equity firm he launched in 1984, for more than a decade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs Romney told <a href=\"http://www.q-and-a.org/Transcript/?ProgramID=1066\">a C-SPAN interviewer</a> in 2006:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I did get a check from my dad when he passed away. I shouldn&rsquo;t say a check, but I did inherit some funds from my dad. But I turned and gave that away to charity. In this case I gave it to a school which Brigham Young University established in his honor. ... And that&rsquo;s where his inheritance ended up.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhy did he give the money away?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I figured we had enough of our own,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to <a href=\"http://marriottschool.byu.edu/mpa/newsletters/Fall2004.pdf\">a short history</a> of the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management at BYU, the family provided an endowment in 1998, within a few years of George Romney&#39;s death.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReince Priebus says that Romney &quot;gave away his father&#39;s inheritance.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney has repeatedly said so himself and that&#39;s backed up by the simple fact that Brigham Young University has an institute named for his father launched just a few years after his death. And there&rsquo;s no reason to think Romney would have needed the money a decade after his lucrative move to Bain Capital.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe find the evidence supports the claim and we see nothing to contradict it. If any evidence emerges, we&#39;ll review it.
