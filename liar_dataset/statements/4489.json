The ad was made and paid for by Building a Better Ohio, the largely business and Republican-backed political action committee supporting SB 5, the law passed earlier this year that restricts the collective bargaining power of Ohio&#39;s public unions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBell, who was elected as an independent in 2009, talks in the ad about his support for Issue 2 because it will give communities tools to help control spending and balance budgets without laying off workers or raising taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe starts the discussion saying: &quot;Years ago, I lost my job as a firefighter because my city ran out of money.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBuilding a Better Ohio adopts Bell&rsquo;s statement as its own on its website.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio took notice. Bell&#39;s record and experience make him worth listening to. A firefighter and certified paramedic who went on the job in 1980, he became Toledo&#39;s youngest-ever and first African American fire chief in 1990, and held the post for more than 16 years. After he retired, then-Gov. Ted Strickland appointed him State Fire Marshal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe commercial also stirred our curiosity. Did Bell really lose his job in a budget crunch and was it at all related to labor issues?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo PolitiFact Ohio looked deeper into the record.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBell was one of 61 Toledo firefighters and 240 total city workers laid off in a budget crisis in 1980, not long after he went on the job. Three fire stations were closed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that happened more than three years before the state&#39;s current collective bargaining law took effect, so PolitiFact Ohio wondered what relevance SB 5 would have -- a question also raised by unions in Toledo.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to accounts in The Toledo Blade, the 1980 layoffs followed a 1979 impasse in negotiations between the city and unions (after the final offer of a three-year contract including 2, 1.5 and 1 percent pay raises) that led to a strike by municipal employees, including police and firefighters -- even though the Ferguson Act prohibited strikes by public employees in Ohio and provided for dismissal of strikers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What ensued,&quot; The Blade reported, &quot;was a 48-hour gap in public safety that allowed mayhem to rule the streets.&quot; Residents armed themselves, and &quot;countless&quot; fires were set.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe budget crisis was not resolved until voters in 1982 approved a &quot;temporary&quot; increase in the income tax, which has been renewed ever since.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRetired Ohio Supreme Court Justice Andy Douglas was a Toledo councilman helping a bipartisan campaign to pass the tax increase in 1982, and he helped negotiate new safety contracts about two years ago. He told The Blade that Toledo&#39;s current budget problems, struggling to afford labor contracts with safety forces, mirror those of 1982.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The only difference is the magnitude of the number in present-day dollars,&quot; he said. &quot;We had exactly the same problems two or three times during my tenure in council.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the ad, Bell says he knows Issue 2 &quot;will give communities the tools they need to get spending under control and balance their budgets without raising taxes on you or laying off good employees.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio isn&rsquo;t rating that part of Bell&rsquo;s statement today. Whether SB 5 is the answer remains hotly debated and we are not examining its merits or flaws.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the claim that Bell was once laid off as a firefighter is accurate. And it is true that his layoff followed an impasse in labor talks with city workers and a strike.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the Truth-O-Meter, the claim about Bell in Building a Better Ohio&rsquo;s rates True.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-09-22T18:49:29.573745", "ruling_date": "2011-09-23T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Building a Better Ohio says Toledo once laid off now-Mayor Mike Bell when the city was out of money", "ruling_headline_slug": "building-better-ohio-says-toledo-once-laid-now-may", "ruling_link_text": "Layoffs for firefighters followed city worker impasse, strike", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBuilding a Better Ohio, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II5KC7iNGF4\">The Tools They Need</a>,&quot; Sept. 6, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tToledo Blade, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2011/09/07/Bell-stars-in-TV-ad-pushing-for-S-B-5.html\">Bell stars in TV ad pushing for SB 5</a>,&quot; Sept. 7, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tToledo Mayor Michael Bell, <a href=\"http://www.ci.toledo.oh.us/MayorsOffice/MayoralStaff/MichaelPBell/tabid/269/Default.aspx\">official biography</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Plain Dealer, &quot;<a href=\"http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/07/shaker_heights_fire_chief_dona.html\">Shaker Heights Fire Chief Donald Barnes is fired by mayor for refusing to cut his budget</a>,&quot; July 7, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tToledo Blade, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2011/09/08/Senate-Bill-5-backers-defend-Bell-ad-timing.html\">Senate Bill 5 backers defend Bell ad timing</a>,&quot; Sept. 8, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tToledo Blade, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2011/09/01/Mayor-Bell-voices-support-for-SB5.html\">Mayor Bell voices support for SB5</a>,&quot; Sept. 1, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tColumbus Dispatch, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2011/09/08/campaign-ad-watch-the-tools-they-need.html\">Campaign Ad Watch: Pro-Issue 2, &lsquo;The Tools They Need</a>,&rsquo;&quot; Sept 8, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tToledo Blade, &quot;Bell retreats from tougher concessions - Police asked to temporarily pay 3% to pensions, defer OT,&quot; March 25, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tToledo Blade, &quot;City deficit has parallels to &#39;82 plight - But Bell vows tax increase would truly be temporary,&quot; Feb. 7, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tToledo Blade, &quot;Troubled financial history seems to repeat itself Leaders have turned to layoffs, tax increases, or renewals to balance budgets over the years,&quot; March 4, 2007<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tToledo Blade, &quot;Critics, backers spar on bargaining limits; Attack on labor or sound fiscal management?,&quot; Feb. 27, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Toledo Deputy Mayor Steve Herwat, Sept. 21, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tToledo Blade, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wtol.com/story/15414562/some-question-claims-made-in-mayor-bell-ad-supporting-issue-2\">Some question claims made in Mayor Bell ad supporting Issue 2</a>,&quot; Sept. 9, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWUPW-TV, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0A6KgJsZU&amp;feature=related\">Mayor Bell on SB 5</a>,&quot; March 14, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJournal News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.journal-news.com/news/ohio-news/history-of-public-employee-collective-bargaining-in-ohio-1255012.html\">History of public employee collective bargaining in Ohio</a>,&quot; Sept. 18, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTestimony of Toledo Deputy Mayor for Operations Stephen J.
