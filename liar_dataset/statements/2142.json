The narration goes like this:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Meet the real Jeff Greene: Ran for Congress as a California Republican. Moved to Florida two years ago. Became a billionaire on Wall Street betting middle-class families would lose their homes. Helped fuel the economic meltdown. Warren Buffet called Greene&#39;s scheme &#39;financial weapons of mass destruction.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe ad then shows footage of Greene saying, &quot;They&#39;ll attack me for my friends and my past when I was single. Some of it&#39;s true, but none of it matters.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Betting on suffering does matter,&quot; the narrator responds.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe previously fact-checked similar claims from Meek that Greene was responsible for hurting the economy. We looked at Meek&#39;s statement that Greene &quot;is the king of the undercover Credit Default Swap that brought about the destruction of our economy that we have right now.&quot; We rated that Barely True. We researched Greene&#39;s activities thoroughly, and found that Greene did make a lot of money on credit default swaps that paid off when mortgage-backed securities failed. But we also found that Meek was pumping up Greene&#39;s role in a complicated economic situation where many different financial players did things to hurt the economy. (Read the <a href=\"http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/jun/22/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-jeff-greene-credit-default-swap/\" id=\"qcrk\" title=\"complete report\">full report</a>.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe also fact-checked the claim that <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/may/24/kendrick-meek/meek-claims-greene-moved-florida-two-years-ago/\" id=\"ytvz\" title=\"Greene moved here\">Greene moved here</a> only two years ago. We rated that True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere, we&#39;re checking Meek&#39;s claim that Greene ran for Congress as a California Republican.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe history here dates back to 1982. Greene was 28 years old and living in California. He ran as a Republican for Congress, for a seat representing the Los Angeles area. But he came in second in the primary with 28.2 percent of the vote. The winner was David Armor, who won 43.9 percent.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<i>The Miami Herald</i> recently tracked down Armor, who was then a 43-year-old social scientist; now he&#39;s a professor of public policy at George Mason University in Virginia. Armor won the primary but lost the general election to then-incumbent Democrat Anthony Beilenson.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tArmor&#39;s recollection is that Greene put out a flier attacking him as an &quot;aging Berkeley radical,&quot; based on Armor&#39;s time as a student activist at University of California at Berkeley.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;It was a hit piece claiming I was a deceiving the people,&#39;&#39; Armor told the <em>Herald</em>. &quot;Being in my 40s, I think I was more offended at being called &#39;aging&#39; than a &#39;radical.&#39; &quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGreene doesn&#39;t dispute that he ran for Congress as a Republican. &quot;For a year of my life I was a Republican, and then I quickly got back to what I really believed in,&#39;&#39; he told the <em>Herald </em>in June.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat&#39;s not clear is how long Greene stayed a Republican. PolitiFact Florida examined <a href=\"http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/jun/29/kendrick-meek/meek-says-greene-only-voted-four-times/\" id=\"volc\" title=\"Greene's voting history\">Greene&#39;s voting history</a> last month, contacting voting officials around the country. The Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk told us that Greene registered as a Republican with an address in the city of Los Angeles in 1982. In 1992, he re-registered with an address in Malibu with a party affiliation of &quot;Decline to State.&quot; If Greene changed his party affiliation shortly after the 1982 run, officials were unable to provide documentation of that.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStill, the record on Greene&#39;s run for Congress as a Republican is undisputed. It was 1982, which was 28 years ago. We rate Meek&#39;s statement True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-28T16:29:59.730143", "ruling_date": "2010-07-28T17:21:35", "ruling_headline": "Jeff Greene ran as a Republican -- 28 years ago", "ruling_headline_slug": "greene-ran-republican-28-years-ago", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, 28 years ago", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tKendrick Meek Campaign, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dT0QthPKdY\" id=\"qq:v\" title=\"He's \r\nthe Man\">He&#39;s the Man</a>, July 26, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://ia341220.us.archive.org/3/items/officialelection00losa/officialelection00losa.pdf\" id=\"svcl\" title=\"Los Angeles County election returns\">Los Angeles County election returns</a>, District 23, June 8, 1982 (pdf, page 115)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Florida, <a href=\"http://politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/jun/29/kendrick-meek/meek-says-greene-only-voted-four-times/\" id=\"b2jb\" title=\"Meek says Greene only voted four times\">Meek says Greene only voted four times</a>, June 29, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Miami Herald, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/06/18/1687091/in-an-earlier-life-democrat-jeff.html#ixzz0uzs6LJ6g\" id=\"lbf:\" title=\"In an earlier life, Democrat Jeff Greene ran as a \r\nRepublican\">In an earlier life, Democrat Jeff Greene ran as a Republican</a>, June 18, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPalm Beach Post, <a href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/state/palm-beach-billionaire-and-democratic-senate-candidate-was-721032.html\" id=\"sm1v\" title=\"Palm Beach billionaire and Democratic Senate candidate\r\n was once a Republican\">Palm Beach billionaire and Democratic Senate candidate was once a Republican</a>, June 1, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "Kendrick", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 298, "last_name": "Meek", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "kendrick-meek", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_KENDRICK_MEEK_1.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/298/", "total_count": 19, "true_count": 5, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tDemocratic candidate Jeff Greene &quot;ran for Congress as a California Republican.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a television ad", "statement_date": "2010-07-26", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 157, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/157/", "subject": "Message Machine 2010", "subject_slug": "message-machine", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 4, "current_job": "businessman", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Jeff", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Florida", "id": 422, "last_name": "Greene", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "jeff-greene", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Debate630_2_472953a.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Florida", "edition": "Florida", "edition_slug": "florida", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 4, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Florida Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/4/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/422/", "total_count": 11, "true_count": 0, "website": "https://www.jeffgreeneforflorida.com/"}], "twitter_headline": "We fact-check Meek's attack ad in #FLSEN Dem primary"}
