Paul Ryan, keynoting the Republican Party of Texas convention in Fort Worth, linked pride in Texas and Wisconsin, his home state, telling delegates on June 9, 2012: &quot;I remember reading a few years ago a story about how Coca-Cola did this big, exhaustive marketing study about how people love their states. First place: Texas. Second place: Wisconsin.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe sought the skinny on that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy email, Ryan campaign spokesman Kevin Seifert replied: &quot;Ryan&#39;s statement is fairly straightforward, Wisconsinites and Texans both love and are proud of their home states.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeifert also pointed us to an entry on the website of Worthpoint, which provides market data on art, antiques and collectibles including soda paraphernalia. The entry <a href=\"http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/coca-cola-jacket-hat-and-more-wisconsin-proud\">states</a> that national focus groups run by Coca-Cola once found that Wisconsin and Texas natives most strongly identify with their states, and by a wide margin. Also, the entry says, Wisconsin and Texas were the only states the Coca-Cola company allowed to develop logos and advertising lines tying each state to the brand and the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Wisconsin &quot;developed this program and used it for most of the decade of the nineties.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tResponding to our inquiry, a Worthpoint representative, Nathan Trapuzzano, pointed out by telephone that the online entry is a copy of a December 2006 eBay post related to the completed auction of a Coca-Cola jacket. &quot;By putting it on our website, we&rsquo;re not saying every word here is true,&quot; Trapuzzano said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked eBay to elaborate. By email, spokeswoman Kari Ramirez said eBay could not provide information on the person who posted that information.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also reached out to the Coca-Cola Company. Spokeswoman Kerry Tressler said that while the company&#39;s internal search for such a study came up dry, it is &quot;likely possible that the study took place.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a follow-up email, Tressler said: &quot;We launched a grassroots marketing effort in the early 1990s called &lsquo;Coca-Cola Texas&rsquo; with a similar program in Wisconsin. Given the size and scope of that type of program, it is highly likely there was a marketing study at the time to validate the points of these campaigns.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn online Nexis search led us to a Feb. 25, 1992, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o8Ty2u0Kf1ZX-x9xN8sPAlxiFjW46ZT6y1eV_x1aSVA/edit\">press release</a> about Coca-Cola launching the Texas campaign, the &quot;most comprehensive marketing initiative ever focusing on a single state.&quot; Separately, Seifert alerted us to a May 11, 1992, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KO55qqEh38dipdutyML_2bAs0Iab5IQjUE4AHxR85JA/edit\">press release</a> saying that up to 10 different radio spots would air in Wisconsin that year featuring a fictitious Coca-Cola truck driver touring the state to discover what &quot;Wisconsin Proud&quot; is all about. The release calls the campaign an extension of Coca-Cola&rsquo;s &quot;Wisconsin Proud&quot; theme introduced, mainly on billboards, in 1989.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe came up with nothing more potentially related to Ryan&rsquo;s claim. You might say: That. Is. It.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe count on individuals who air claims to have factual backup. On this front, an unattributed eBay post about focus groups is insufficient. And while it&rsquo;s believable that Coca-Cola ad campaigns launched 20 years ago drew on research, that does not demonstrate there was an exhaustive national study like the one described by Ryan.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan&#39;s claim still strikes us as having a touch of truth. As prideful Texans, we&rsquo;re hat-in-hand sorry to rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-21T18:09:20.216011", "ruling_date": "2012-06-22T11:51:22", "ruling_headline": "Paul Ryan says national Coca-Cola study showed Texans and Wisconsinites love their states the most", "ruling_headline_slug": "paul-ryan-says-national-coca-cola-study-showed-tex", "ruling_link_text": "Study's existence unconfirmed, dang it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tEmail, Kevin Seifert, communications director, Paul Ryan campaign, June 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTelephone interview, Nathan Trapuzzano, customer care representative, Worthpoint, Columbus, Ohio, June 21, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail, Kari Ramirez, spokesperson, Global Communications, eBay Inc., June 21, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/19lmYregd2Eaz8FPrw14q_YoUv9slYiItf8swysz1Xpw/edit\">Emails</a> (excerpted), responses to PolitiFact Texas, Kerry Tressler, director, Brand &amp; Business Communications, The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, June 14, 2012 and June 19, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPress releases, Coca-Cola campaigns in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o8Ty2u0Kf1ZX-x9xN8sPAlxiFjW46ZT6y1eV_x1aSVA/edit\">Texas</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KO55qqEh38dipdutyML_2bAs0Iab5IQjUE4AHxR85JA/edit\">Wisconsin</a>, February 25, 1992 and May 11, 1992 (Nexis search and pointed out by Seifert)</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 23, "current_job": "U.S. Representative", "false_count": 7, "first_name": "Paul", "half_true_count": 24, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 373, "last_name": "Ryan", "mostly_true_count": 16, "name_slug": "paul-ryan", "pants_count": 5, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AP_WX201_HOUSE_2016_PRIMARI.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/373/", "total_count": 89, "true_count": 10, "website": "http://www.house.gov/ryan/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays a national Coca-Cola study showed Texans love Texas more than residents of any other state love their state; Wisconsinites ranked second.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech to the Republican Party of Texas convention in Fort Worth.", "statement_date": "2012-06-09", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 42, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/42/", "subject": "History", "subject_slug": "history", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
