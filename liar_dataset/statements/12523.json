That&rsquo;s huge.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are the vast majority of Apple and Intel products made without financing war in the Democratic Republic of Congo?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer is complicated. While both Apple and Intel are commended by human rights groups for their leadership in transparency, Wright&rsquo;s numbers are off. More importantly, experts told us it&rsquo;s impossible to ensure that anything is completely conflict-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conflict minerals, a primer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Democratic Republic of Congo&rsquo;s rich mineral deposits, worth about <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/newscentre/Default.aspx?DocumentID=2656&amp;ArticleID=8890\">$24 trillion</a>, supply the world&rsquo;s demand for electronics and fund militias that have been warring with each other and the government for decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rebel groups like the Lord&rsquo;s Resistance Army (remember <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4MnpzG5Sqc\">Kony</a>?) and the Congolese military itself loot or seize control of mines in the Kivu region.

Armed groups earned an estimated <a href=\"http://www.enoughproject.org/files/Comprehensive-Approach.pdf\">$184 million</a> from just four minerals in 2008 alone. Here&rsquo;s a video from Enough Project, a human rights group, on how it all works:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"394\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aF-sJgcoY20?rel=0\" width=\"700\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Corporate reporting</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wright may have been thinking of figures in Apple&rsquo;s and Intel&rsquo;s filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but she misstated a few things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, publically traded companies are required disclose use of conflict minerals &mdash; specifically tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold &mdash; annually to the SEC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, Apple <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000119312515045292/d864750dex101.htm\">reported</a> 88 percent of its smelters and refineries were verified as conflict-free or participating in third-party auditing programs. That same year, Intel <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50863/000005086315000031/exh101.htm\">said</a> 100 percent of microprocessors and chipsets were conflict-free, but it couldn&rsquo;t determine if the label applied to other products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both companies improved their numbers in 2015, according to their latest SEC filings. About <a href=\"http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/corporate-responsibility/conflict-free-sec-filing.html\">78 percent</a> of Intel&rsquo;s smelters and refineries were deemed conflict-free. Apple <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/supplier-responsibility/pdf/Conflict_Minerals_Report_2016.pdf\">stated</a> 100 percent of its smelters and refiners are in audits but said it does not believe verification was sufficient to label its products &quot;conflict-free.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a chart showing how the two stack up next to other companies:</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"371\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/109du-WvMlF1O3lmkLP7heptjHZKt1qzIuha2EIPBxSo/pubchart?oid=99017825&amp;format=interactive\" width=\"600\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"><em>*Apple rejects the label conflict-free</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"><em>**No 2015 report was available; numbers taken from 2014 report.

Carly Oboth, a policy adviser for the watchdog NGO, <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/\">Global Witness</a>, called the designation &quot;hypothetical and aspirational.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Oboth, smelters and refineries receive verification based on their capacity to do due diligence (i.e. chain of custody documentation and proof of insurance), not whether they&rsquo;ve taken the steps to ensure their supplies were actually mined humanely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The auditing regiment is currenting being revised, Oboth said, &quot;but for the time being, there&rsquo;s no oversight on whether they&rsquo;re negating risks.&quot; And while Global Witness <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/why-its-good-thing-apple-isnt-declaring-its-products-conflict-free/\">commended</a> Apple for its decision to reject the &quot;conflict-free,&quot; Oboth said it and Intel could be doing more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9yJSxSvYNkpGWZ0kYusEp103omavU30mTfc9aXL9bFU1QaMOB3oFhlyftTVgWMRdZQ19EZYqm-DmS8hGnyHFz_ybNDx93af-en9cmncTk9tuYvN7IlHDZ6hJRrYaG2TSWygNPM8b\" style=\"border:none; height:488px; width:900px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"><em>(AP Photo)</em></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are few means to verify in the conflict-ridden eastern part of the country where many mines are located. Beyond issues of accessibility, miners and the armed groups have found ways of circumventing the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of minerals are being smuggled into neighboring countries with higher profit margins and much less rigorous certification methods, if they exist at all, Seay told us. <a href=\"https://www.itri.co.uk/about-itri\">ITR</a>, a tin auditing firm, prices a kilo of tin at $2 while the same amount would fetch $4 or $5 in Rwanda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you can get your minerals, which may or may not be conflict-free, into Rwanda, you can get it labeled conflict-free,&quot; she said. &quot;Do you take the $2 or do you hire a boat and go to Rwanda? It&rsquo;s a no brainer.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And even if the minerals stay in the country, Seay pointed out, the audit system has spurred a cottage industry for conflict-free labels: &quot;You can also buy the tag in the markets in Kigali. All the incentives are set up for people to lie.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Labels as lip service</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the question of whether conflict-free labeling actually curbs violence and protects human rights. The evidence is mixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dodd-Frank <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/02/how-dodd-frank-is-failing-congo-mining-conflict-minerals/\">didn&rsquo;t</a> <a href=\"https://ethuin.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/09092014-open-letter-final-and-list.pdf\">work out</a> as planned initially. The Congolese government enacted a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-11269360\">temporary ban</a> on mining and companies avoided sourcing from the region altogether.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?order=wbapi_data_value_2013%20wbapi_data_value&amp;sort=asc\">one of the poorest countries in the world</a> where mining employs <a href=\"http://www.opml.co.uk/sites/default/files/DRC%20mining%20report%20-%20OPM%20-%20Final%20Eng.pdf\">one sixth of its population</a>, Dodd-Frank &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/how-a-well-intentioned-us-law-left-congolese-miners-jobless/2014/11/30/14b5924e-69d3-11e4-9fb4-a622dae742a2_story.html\">set off a chain of events that has has propelled millions of miners and their families deeper into poverty</a>.&quot; Meanwhile, there were few signs that it had <a href=\"http://aiddata.org/blog/dodd-frank-in-the-drc-regulation-aid-and-the-resource-curse\">tempered violence</a> or <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/20121130_Mapping_Conflict_Motives_M23.pdf\">weakened the militias</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But now that the ban has ended and companies are once again buying from the Democratic Republic of Congo, experts view Dodd-Frank a bit more positively.

Seay said they&rsquo;ve savvied up (i.e. by removing guards with machine guns from the mines) while finding funding sources in border crossings, charcoal, &quot;conflict weed&quot;, wildlife smuggling, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The narrow focus of Dodd-Frank also means that &quot;conflict-free&quot; isn&rsquo;t the same thing as abuse-free. Amnesty has documented <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2016/01/child-labour-behind-smart-phone-and-electric-car-batteries/\">child labor in the DRC&rsquo;s production of cobalt</a>, which is not designated as a &quot;conflict mineral.&quot; Global Witness found <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/afghanistan/war-treasury-people-afghanistan-lapis-lazuli-and-battle-mineral-wealth/\">lapis lazuli funds the Taliban</a>, but Dodd-Frank doesn&rsquo;t apply because the mines are in Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You can have a completely clean mine, as designated by Dodd-Frank, with child laborers and where woman are trading sex with the pit bosses in order to sell lunch around the periphery,&quot; Seay said. &quot;There&rsquo;s no such thing as 100 percent conflict-free anything.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wright said Apple products are currently &quot;90 percent conflict-free,&quot; and &quot;Intel is 100 percent conflict-free.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numbers are off. Intel says 100 percent of is processors are conflict-free, but couldn&rsquo;t vouch for its other products. Apple reported that 100 percent of its supply chain was participating in audits, but rejected the label.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While experts commend both companies for leading the sector in moving away from conflict minerals, they cautioned against labeling anything 100 percent &quot;conflict-free.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Wright&rsquo;s claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6012a2b8-893f-45e6-ba1e-9220fa3d64e7\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6012a2b8-893f-45e6-ba1e-9220fa3d64e7</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-14T13:02:28.304879", "ruling_date": "2016-06-15T15:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Did your phone, computer contribute to suffering in the Congo?", "ruling_headline_slug": "did-your-phone-computer-contribute-suffering-congo", "ruling_link_text": "Label is hypothetical & aspirational", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Rockefeller Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrMApkQ8nMI\">&#39;Making Noise&#39;: Robin Wright and the Path Towards Global Equality | Insight Dialogues</a>,&quot;
