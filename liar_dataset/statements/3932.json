Kendrick Meek and Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican turned independent, to win a U.S. Senate seat in 2010. In 2012, Republican candidates will likely be clamoring to share the stage with the young, charismatic Rubio -- including Adam Hasner, who is running in a Republican primary for the other U.S. Senate seat now held by Bill Nelson.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHasner will face George LeMieux, among others, in the GOP primary. LeMieux was once Crist&#39;s &quot;maestro&quot; -- serving as Crist&#39;s campaign manager and then his chief of staff when Crist was governor. Crist returned the favor and appointed LeMieux to serve out a vacancy in the U.S. Senate in 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHasner portrays LeMieux as the foe of Rubio in an <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/adam-hasner-takes-george-lemieux\">Internet ad</a> he released June 10, 2011. Set against a backdrop of a photo of Crist, here is the text of the ad:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em> Defended President Obama&#39;s Stimulus As &quot;Helpful To Florida</em><em>&quot;</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Fought For Taxpayer Funded Bailout Of Big Sugar<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tArchitect of Obama-Style Cap And Trade Plan For Florida<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFalsely Attacked Marco Rubio<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven Compared Marco Rubio To Barack Obama<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCharlie Crist -- Right?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWrong.</em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs the word &quot;wrong&quot; appears, the camera zooms out on the picture of Crist. There is LeMieux, whispering in Crist&#39;s ear. The ad finishes -- &quot;Get to know the Real George LeMieux.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&#39;re checking Hasner&#39;s claim that LeMieux compared Rubio to Obama in a separate item. In this case, we will examine whether LeMieux &quot;falsely attacked Marco Rubio.&quot; The ad doesn&#39;t state the subject of the attack but attributes it to a May 9, 2009, <em><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/gubernatorial/article999317.ece\">St. Petersburg Times</a></em> article. Hasner spokesman Rick Wilson sent us the article in an e-mail, and said that the false attack was that LeMieux labeled Rubio a tax raiser.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrom the article: &#39;&quot;Marco Rubio supported the largest tax increase in Florida history when he wanted to raise the sales tax by 2 or 3 pennies,&quot; LeMieux said of Rubio&#39;s 2007 tax swap plan (the Democratic Party already is using that as an anti-Rubio talking point).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&#39;ve written about Rubio&#39;s tax swap plan before. The idea surfaced during Rubio&#39;s first months as speaker in early 2007, as the Legislature and Crist were looking for ways to cut property taxes for Floridians. Rubio&#39;s proposal would scratch property taxes on all primary residences. In its place, the state sales tax would be increased by 2.5 cents per dollar -- subject to voter approval.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA state House analysis originally said the swap would save taxpayers a total of $5.8 billion in the first year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut whether you saved money or spent more money at the end of the year likely depended on your individual circumstances. Back in 2007, the <em>Times </em>ran calculations under Rubio&#39;s proposal for both homeowners and renters.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> The homeowners</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA family of four with an annual income of $64,280. Home value: $241,100<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCURRENT<br />\r\n\tProperty tax bill in Tampa: $5,061.06<br />\r\n\tSales taxes paid: $951<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPROPOSED<br />\r\n\tProperty tax bill in Tampa: $0<br />\r\n\tSales taxes paid: $1,290<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder Rubio&#39;s plan, these homeowners would have paid $4,722 less in state taxes, the <em>Times </em>found. Contrast that with renters:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The renters</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA family of two with an annual income of $46,914<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCURRENT<br />\r\n\tRent: $851<br />\r\n\tSales taxes paid: $691<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPROPOSED<br />\r\n\tRent: $851<br />\r\n\tSales taxes paid: $937</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnder Rubio&#39;s plan, these renters would pay an additional $246 a year in taxes. The rental property owners also would still have to pay property taxes, meaning rent wouldn&#39;t be affected.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOverall, on the micro level, some people would pay more and others would pay less. At the macro level, two different studies said Floridians would have paid less in taxes -- between $5.8 billion and $6.5 billion. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/mar/28/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-calls-marco-rubios-2007-tax-swap-pro/\">As such we rated a claim by <u>Crist that the plan was a &quot;massive increase&quot; in taxes False.</u></a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn his web ad, Hasner said LeMieux &quot;falsely attacked Marco Rubio.&quot; The ad cites a newspaper article in which LeMieux said Rubio&#39;s tax swap proposal was the &quot;largest tax increase in Florida history.&quot; PolitiFact Florida previously ruled that Rubio&#39;s plan was a tax decrease so there&#39;s no doubt it is a false attack.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur only quibble is that the ad failed to explain what Hasner was talking about -- so viewers are left guessing.
