Debbie Wasserman Schultz &quot;the most vile, unprofessional and despicable&quot; member of the House.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWest, a retired Army colonel and favorite of the tea party movement, sent the e-mail July 19, 2011, after Wasserman Schultz criticized him in a floor speech for supporting the GOP&#39;s &quot;cut, cap, and balance&quot; plan to sharply reduce spending and require a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. That plan, Wasserman Schultz said, &quot;would increase costs for Medicare beneficiaries, unbelievable from a member from South Florida.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitical blogs and talk shows got a lot of mileage out of West&#39;s subsequent outburst, in which he asserted Wasserman Schultz was &quot;not a Lady.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut on July 20, West told a Fox reporter that Wasserman Schultz and other Democrats have been attacking him &quot;for quite some time.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;She&#39;s not a victim,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere&#39;s the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2011/07/20/allen_west_responds_to_wasserman_schultz_youre_not_a_victim.html\" id=\"i5e6\" title=\"clip\">entire sound bite</a>:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;This is something once again the Democrat Party (sic), when they put my Social Security number and my wife&#39;s Employment Identification Number in a mail piece, this has just been an ongoing thing. I&#39;ve been called Uncle Tom, a sellout Oreo. It&#39;s not about Allen West. So once again, it&#39;s very interesting to me that we continually allow liberals to do whatever they want in attacking conservatives but all of a sudden, when a conservative stands up and says, &#39;Enough,&#39; then people want to sit back especially liberals, want to play victim. She&#39;s not a victim. She&#39;s been attacking Allen West for quite some time.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWest has been known to make some provocative statements, including saying he had a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/sep/24/allen-west/allen-west-says-he-has-clearance-even-president-un/\" id=\"qxo1\" title=\"security clearance is stronger than a president's\">security clearance higher than the president,</a> so we wondered if claims about Democrats distributing his personal information in mailers was true.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe blow-up started when the government <a href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/state/dems-include-west-social-security-number-in-flier-927371.html\" id=\"a:8g\" title=\"hit West with a tax lien in 2005\">hit West with a $11,081 tax lien in 2005</a>.

Ron Klein.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0910/42427.html\" title=\"The party crafted a mailer\">The party crafted a mailer</a> to Fort Lauderdale-area voters depicting a photo of an IRS document showing the tax lien. The Democrats redacted West&#39;s address and his wife&#39;s name but left visible his Social Security number and her Employer Identification Number (an <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98350,00.html\">Internal Revenue Service code</a> used to identify West&#39;s wife&#39;s employer).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;I&#39;m not yet sure the potential damage that might come to my wife and me, and it makes me sick to think of what could happen to my daughters,&quot; West said in a statement. &quot;My entire family is at risk of identity theft.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to POLITICO, the Democratic Party chastised West for his &quot;paranoia&quot; but said the party would pay for two years of identity theft monitoring as a result of the &quot;oversight.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;After making every effort to remove all of Allen West&#39;s private information, unlike West who refuses to apologize to Florida&#39;s taxpayers for not paying his taxes and his bills, we apologize for the oversight of not redacting this information from the public record included in the mailer,&quot; spokesman Eric Jotkoff said in a statement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWest would proceed to defeat Klein in the general election, but not before using the Democrats&#39; blunder to raise some money.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Recently, incumbent Ron Klein&#39;s political cronies sent out a mailer revealing my Social Security Number. ...

But the mailer episode was well-documented by reporters, and the party admitted and apologized.
