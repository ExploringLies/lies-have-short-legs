The roommates in the Seaside Heights beach house aren&rsquo;t from New Jersey.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Here&#39;s the deal, let&#39;s remember something for the people who are listening in your audience, these &#39;Jersey Shore&#39; folks, they&#39;re from New York,&quot; Christie said Wednesday on 77 WABC&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Joe Crummey Show&rsquo;. &quot;They parachute these New Yorkers into Seaside Heights, New Jersey, and they try to make the whole country think this is New Jersey. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s bad for New Jersey. It&#39;s bad ... because it&#39;s a mischaracterization of who the people are here in New Jersey and so I&#39;ve said all along that I think &lsquo;Jersey Shore&rsquo; is bad.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChristie last month vetoed a $420,000 tax credit -- dubbed the &quot;Snooki subsidy&quot; -- for the MTV show, saying the program &quot;does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the State and its citizens.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere are eight fist-pumping housemates who are the target of Christie&rsquo;s scorn.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf them, two are New Jersey natives, PolitiFact New Jersey found.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSamantha Giancola, or Sammi, and Deena Nicole Cortese were born and raised in New Jersey.

Rhode Island-native Paul DelVecchio is the only cast member from outside the tri-state area.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn MTV spokesperson declined to comment on Christie&rsquo;s remarks. But Polizzi spoke with The Star-Ledger in August.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&rsquo;s the &#39;Jersey Shore.&#39; We&rsquo;re not trying to represent Jersey,&quot; she said then. &quot;Even if you&rsquo;re from Africa, you&rsquo;re gonna come here.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe governor said the cast members of the &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; are from New York and misrepresent &quot;who the people are here in New Jersey.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSammi and Deena are true Jersey girls -- born and raised. &quot;The Situation&quot; was born in New York, but grew up and still lives in New Jersey.
