The <em>New York Times</em> just a few minutes ago posted a story about &mdash; in exchange for five minutes with Bill Clinton, the government of Qatar was going to give $1 million to the Clinton Foundation,&quot; Pence <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-october-16-2016-n667251\">said</a> Oct. 16, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to fact-check Pence&rsquo;s claim about Qatar and its $1 million donation. We found that Pence is largely accurate in his description of the <em>New York Times</em> account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/us/politics/wikileaks-bill-clinton-foundation.html\">article</a>, published Oct. 15, details an email to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta,&nbsp;obtained by Wikileaks. (The Clinton camp has yet to confirm or deny the leak&rsquo;s authenticity.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amitabh Desai, the Clinton Foundation&rsquo;s foreign policy director, <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8396\">emailed</a> three Clinton Foundation employees and Doug Band, Bill Clinton&rsquo;s personal aide on April 16, 2012, about his meetings with ambassadors from Qatar and a few other foreign countries. Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Qatar &mdash; Would like to see WJC (William Jefferson Clinton) for &lsquo;five minutes&rsquo; in NYC, to present $1 million check that Qatar promises from WJC&rsquo;s birthday in 2011,&quot; Desai wrote. &quot;Qatar would welcome our suggestions for investments in Haiti &mdash;&nbsp;particularly on education and health. They have allocated most of their $20 million but are happy to consider projects we suggest.

But according to Desai&rsquo;s email, Qatar had promised the check for Bill Clinton&rsquo;s birthday the previous year. The meeting was to present the check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, it&rsquo;s not clear if the Qatari ambassador ever got his &quot;five minutes&quot; with the former president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign government contributions to the Clinton Foundation have been the subject of much criticism lobbed against the Clintons. While they are legal, questions have been raised over possible conflicts of interest for Hillary Clinton while she was serving as secretary of state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of a memorandum of understanding between the Clinton Foundation and the Obama administration, the foundation agreed to (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/31/hillary-clinton/did-clinton-foundation-go-above-and-beyond-transpa/\">among other things</a>) disclose material increases from foreign donors and roll back foreign donations altogether to its global health initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A State Department spokesperson told the <em>New York Times</em> that it does not have &quot;a record of submission&quot; from the Clinton Foundation on a 2012 donation from Qatar. A Clinton Foundation spokesman told us the 2012 donation was disclosed on its website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Qatari government has given&nbsp;cumulatively between&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%241%2C000%2C001%20to%20%245%2C000%2C000&amp;page=2\">$1 million to $5 million</a> to the Clinton Foundation from 2002 to 2016.
