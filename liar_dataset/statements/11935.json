Douglas mentioned an extreme example of board negligence to make her case against SB 1416 on Feb. 4 during a state <a href=\"http://azleg.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=26&amp;clip_id=16631&amp;meta_id=333281\">Senate Education Committee meeting</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We presented a <a href=\"http://media2.abc15.com/html/pdf/FactCheck2-12-16.PDF\">report</a> to the board on (teacher discipline) that showed their abject failure to report teachers whose certifications have been revoked or suspended to the national database,&quot; she said. &quot;And in one instance, because of that failure to report, it resulted in the death of a student.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her accusation was striking, so we wanted to fact-check whether the board failed to report a teacher&rsquo;s history and if it resulted in a student&rsquo;s death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The board erred</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Douglas was referring to former high school math teacher Tamara Hofmann. She taught at Marcos de Niza High School in Tempe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In November 2006, Chandler police found Hofmann and one of her students, Sixto Balbuena, together in her car. Both denied sexual relations when questioned by police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The incident immediately spurred an internal school investigation. Hofmann was removed from the classroom, but her provisional secondary teaching certificate remained valid until it expired on Jan. 5, 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically, a teacher needs to teach for three years on a provisional certificate before the state issues them a standard one. The process is usually automatic as the state Department of Education vets a teacher&rsquo;s experience before issuing the certificate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, only the state Board of Education can take action on a certificate, whether it&#39;s revoking or suspending an existing certificate, or denying a new certificate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state board took no action on her provisional certificate. On Jan. 18, the school closed its investigation. She appealed the discipline &mdash; 10 days unpaid suspension and a letter of reprimand &mdash; before it was denied and imposed in February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state board admitted that they recorded the investigation <a href=\"http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue/2009/04/22/114941-teacher-in-chandler-sex-case-hired-because-of-error/\">internally</a>, but a clerical error did not show anyone outside the board that she was under investigation. If reported correctly, anyone could search for a teacher and whether or not they have any discipline using the <a href=\"https://oacis.azed.gov/PublicOACIS/NormalPages/Educators.aspx\">state&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state Department of Education, in turn, did not see that Hofmann was under investigation before they issued her a standard teaching certificate on Jan. 29, 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There was nothing to flag it,&quot; Department of Education spokesman Charles Tack said. &quot;That never got into the system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hofmann returned to school in March 2007, working in the district&rsquo;s office away from students. Hofmann continued to work in the district office until her contract ended in May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>El Dorado High School in Chandler hired Hofmann the following summer. Like the department, they did not see past discipline for Hofmann visible on the state&rsquo;s web site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was there Hofmann met another student, Samuel Valdivia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 2009, Hofmann&rsquo;s alleged lover, Sixto Balbuena, walked in on Hofmann with Valdivia at her apartment. Balbuena <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=7333818\">stabbed and killed</a> Valdivia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was only after the murder that Hofmann surrendered her certificate instead of going through a state board hearing. The board launched a <a href=\"http://media2.abc15.com/html/pdf/10revocation.pdf\">complaint</a> against the certificate in November 2009 and approved her surrender in January 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the &quot;national database,&quot; Douglas was referring to the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification. It is an oversight board for all state education departments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reporting Hofmann&#39;s discipline at Marcos de Niza to the association would have provided another red flag to El Dorado before they hired her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Association CEO Phillip Rogers said a teacher with a valid certificate could still have discipline reported to the database. States decide on their own what to report to the database, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In some states a reprimand where the educator retains his/her certificate might be reported, and in other states it would not,&quot; Rogers said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The one entry in the national database on Hofmann is from Jan. 27, 2010 &mdash; two days after she surrendered her teaching certificate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Douglas said, &quot;We presented a report to the board on (teacher discipline) that showed their abject failure to report teachers whose certifications have been revoked or suspended to the national database,&quot; she said. &quot;And in one instance, because of that failure to report, it resulted in the death of a student.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear: There is not a straight line between the actions of the Board of Education and the death of a student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the actions -- or, really, lack of action -- by the Board of Education prevented a school district from seeing red flags that might have prevented Hofmann&rsquo;s hiring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without those flags, Hofmann was rehired. And that&rsquo;s how a student ended up in a position that ultimately resulted in his death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Douglas&rsquo; claim is accurate but requires that fuller description of events. So we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-18T18:09:23.698126", "ruling_date": "2016-02-19T12:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Arizona's schools chief links 2009 murder to board's failures", "ruling_headline_slug": "arizonas-schools-chief-links-2009-murder-boards-fa", "ruling_link_text": "Faulty reporting", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>State Superintendent of Public Instruction Diane Douglas, <a href=\"http://azleg.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=26&amp;clip_id=16631&amp;meta_id=333281\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Remarks during a Senate Education Committee meeting</u></a>, Feb. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with state Department of Education spokesman Charles Tack, Feb. 8-18,2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification CEO Phillip Rogers, Feb. 9-12, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Tempe Union High School District spokeswoman Jill Hanks, Feb. 8-17, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Arizona State Board of Education Executive Director Karol Schmidt, Feb. 10-17, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABC News, &quot;<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=7333818\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Arizona Teen Caught Up in Student-Teacher Love Triangle Killed</u></a>,&quot; April 15, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arizona Department of Education - Certification Unit, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.azed.gov/educator-certification/files/2011/09/requirements-for-secondary-certificate.pdf?20151109-\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Requirements for Secondary Education</u></a>,&quot; accessed Feb. 10, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, &quot;<a href=\"http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue/2009/04/22/114941-teacher-in-chandler-sex-case-hired-because-of-error/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Teacher in Chandler sex case hired because of error</u></a>,&quot; April 22, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Board of Education, &quot;<a href=\"http://media2.abc15.com/html/pdf/10revocation.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Consideration of Review Case No. C-2009-033, Tamara D.
