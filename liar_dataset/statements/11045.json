This means that anyone who would want to sell merchandise with the flag&rsquo;s image would have to request permission from the couple or risk a lawsuit. The article includes a quote by a person identified as the couple&rsquo;s attorney, Ralph Hammerstein, in connection to the matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"197px;\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ucAEQ_wSS0XLNEusidnAYrU71H2mDCm2eaCy3uglczF9X5y1DVU6odZ0-DLvtFzfnHnuUdbU3Strg_gHgIQtfP4j9BdTt5R0uVs7iFokinyv4OLWdGDSgO53spr43D43M0Qypuk\" style=\"border:none;\" width=\"624px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Is there any truth to this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The short answer is&nbsp;no.

Its own <a href=\"http://newswatch33.com/disclaimer/\">disclaimer</a> says that relying on the &quot;accuracy (or) reliability&quot; of the website information is at users&rsquo; &quot;own risk.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the other articles published by Newswatch33 have already been proven to be bogus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">WPDE.com, a website powered by ABC 15, recently <a href=\"http://www.carolinalive.com/news/story.aspx?id=1226875#.VZ2VFvlVhHy\">wrote</a> that the events in a hate crime &quot;news&quot; story published by Newswatch33 never happened. Here is a cached <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:rfsyZILdMUYJ:https://newswatch33.com/news/independence-day-massacre-2-black-teens-beaten-to-death-by-white-supremacists-1-in-critical-condition/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\">image</a> of the article that appears to have been taken down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Snopes.com took a look at another article from Newswatch 33 that <a href=\"https://newswatch33.com/news/charleston-church-shooter-dylann-roof-receives-4-million-in-donations-from-supporters/\">claimed</a> that South Carolina church shooter Dylann Roof received $4 million in supporter donations. Snopes rated this claim <a href=\"http://m.snopes.com/dylann-roof-donations/\">False</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other claims from the website seem just as ludicrous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why you can&#39;t buy rights to the Confederate flag</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There&rsquo;s no evidence Hammerstein is really the Carters&rsquo; attorney, nor any other verifiable account of this story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even if the quote were accurate -- which it&rsquo;s not -- getting the rights to the Confederate flag would be a fool&rsquo;s errand. Not even for $280 million?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;No,&quot; said Christopher Jon Sprigman, a law professor at New York University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Because the flag was created under the laws of the Confederacy, even if there was a copyright on this, it&rsquo;s a question of whether it would still be covered (by that copyright),&quot; Sprigman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The particular design that we now associate with the Confederacy was actually rejected as the Confederate States of America&rsquo;s national flag in 1861. Designed by South Carolinian Rep. William Porcher Miles, it was later an unofficial emblem of General Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s army in Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is unclear whether Porcher legally laid claim to his design, but either way, federal law only protects an author&rsquo;s copyright <a href=\"http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf\">for 70 years</a> after his or her death. The Porcher estate&rsquo;s claim to the flag has long run out; he died in 1899. Just like the American flag, the Confederate flag is now in the public domain, free to reproduce and distribute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Furthermore, it would be extremely difficult to file a trademark on the flag. <a href=\"http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/resources/exam/examguide2-07.jsp\">According</a> to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), &quot;a refusal (of the trademark) must be issued if the design would be perceived by the public as a flag.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We could only find one instance throughout history of a flag being successfully copyrighted: Australian artist Harold Thomas <a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/1997/215.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">sought and won</a> the exclusive rights to the flag he created for Australia&rsquo;s Aboriginal people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Newswatch33 reported that &quot;Jay-Z and Beyonce Attempt to Buy Rights to Confederate Flag to Prevent Further Use.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The website has published dubious stories before, and this seems to be yet another fabrication.
