It said, &quot;USA is #1 in gun violence. Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That&#39;s 270 people a day and 87 dead because of gun violence every day.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn this item, we&rsquo;ll look at the second half of that claim: &quot;Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That&#39;s 270 people a day and 87 dead.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The numbers</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe turned to statistics from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; experts in the field told us it keeps the most reliable statistics on the subject. The CDC collects two sets of relevant data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first is data for deaths by guns, which is included in an <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr60/nvsr60_03.pdf\">annual report</a> about deaths of all types during calendar year 2009. The numbers for gun deaths is broken down into several categories:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Suicide</strong>: 18,735 deaths<br />\r\n\t<strong>Homicide</strong>: 11,493 deaths<br />\r\n\t<strong>Unintentional</strong>: 554 deaths<br />\r\n\t<strong>Legal interventions</strong>: 333 deaths<br />\r\n\t<strong>Undetermined</strong>: 232 deaths<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Total</strong>: 31,347 deaths<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/nfirates2001.html\">second data set</a> tracks non-fatal injuries by guns. According to the CDC, there were 73,505 non-fatal firearm injuries in 2010. (We will ignore an additional 13,851 non-fatal injuries from BB or pellet guns.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>How accurate is the Facebook post?</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you add together the gun deaths and the non-fatal gun injuries, you get 104,852 people shot every year. That&rsquo;s very close to what the Facebook post said. The Facebook post was also close in its daily averages -- 287 people shot every day, and 86 deaths by gun every day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s one area, however, in which the Facebook post could have benefited from additional context. It says that &quot;nearly 100,000 people get shot every year,&quot; which to us suggests that a victim is being shot by someone else. In reality, a significant majority of gun deaths comes from <em>self-inflicted </em>firearm wounds.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you ignore the suicides -- and if you assume that relatively few people survive a suicide attempt with a firearm (we couldn&rsquo;t find any hard data on that question) -- then the number of people who got shot, either fatally or non-fatally, was about 86,000, or roughly 235 a day. That&rsquo;s lower than the Facebook post indicated. And the daily number of firearm deaths would be substantially lower -- 35 per day, rather than the 87 cited in the Facebook post.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe numbers in the Facebook post are close to accurate, as long as you make one major assumption -- that suicides count as &quot;get(ting) shot.&quot; We think that assumption is debatable, but there is no question that at least 100,000 people did die or become injured from firearms. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-07-23T13:29:21.507819", "ruling_date": "2012-07-23T13:46:18", "ruling_headline": "Do 100,000 people get shot every year in U.S.?
