We received a copy and we heard a caller cite it recently on WPRO&rsquo;s &quot;The Buddy Cianci Show,&quot; so we decided to check it out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe e-mail claims the increase was &quot;purposely delayed so as not to confuse the 2012 Re-Election Campaigns.&quot; It says the $104.20 monthly fee for 2012 will be &quot;$120.20 per month in 2013 and $247.00 per month in 2014.&quot; That&#39;s more than double in one year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome other versions blame Obamacare for the sharp increase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;You probably haven&#39;t heard about it in the Mainstream News,&quot; the e-mail says.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWell, there&#39;s a reason for that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim is as bogus as a $3 bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFact-checkers everywhere have debunked it, including <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/27/chain-email/medicare-premiums-going-due-obamacare-chain-e-mail/\">PolitiFact National</a> and our friends at <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2011/04/premium-nonsense-on-medicare/\">FactCheck.org</a> and <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/medical/medicare.asp\">Snopes.com</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the version that&#39;s making the rounds has a new twist: it comes from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMore about that in a moment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, we should update some numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe e-mail says the &quot;current&quot; monthly fee is $96.40. That was actually the premium in 2009. It gives a 2012 rate as $104.20; it&#39;s actually $99.90.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe premium for 2013 will be set in the fall. But according to Page 229 of the <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/ReportsTrustFunds/downloads/tr2012.pdf\">2012 report</a> from the board of trustees on Medicare, the estimated standard monthly premium will be about $109.10 a month, not $120.20. In 2014 it will be about $3 more, not $127 more as the e-mail claims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter that, the report projects, annual increases through 2021 will likely range from 4.3 to 6.1 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt should be noted that higher-income seniors are charged more, a provision that was in place years before Obamacare was passed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow back to Blue Cross.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe suspect that the e-mail is getting additional credence because it carries the logo of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama and contact information for a worker there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we called Alabama, Koko Mackin, a Blue Cross vice president, said the worker had simply received the e-mail and forwarded it without assessing whether it was true.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This e-mail was not created or approved for distribution by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama and is not reflective of the Company&#39;s position. It contains incorrect information received by an employee who redistributed it to six others,&quot; she said in a statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA chain e-mail says Medicare insurance premiums will be rising to &quot;$120.20 per month in 2013 and $247.00 per month in 2014.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim has been repeatedly debunked and although the truth can easily be found with a quick Google search, it continues to spread.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven newer estimates from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services show that the increases projected through 2021 will bring the premium to $161.20 -- not even close to the $247 premium that the e-mail says will take effect in 2014.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo if you&#39;re feeling hot and bothered after reading and passing along this bit of e-mail twaddle, it&#39;s not because seniors will be facing a 105 percent premium increase from 2013 to 2014.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&#39;s because you&#39;ve got <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">Pants on Fire</a>!<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter:<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> @politifactri</a>.
