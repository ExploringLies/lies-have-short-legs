As she speaks, words appear on the screen:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Supreme Court cases heard, over 550&quot;<br class=\"kix-line-break\" />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen: &quot;Appellate cases heard: over 2,400.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe first figure didn&rsquo;t jump out at us -- after all, Roggensack is approaching 10 years on the high court.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut her Wisconsin Court of Appeals stint in Madison-based District 4 lasted only seven years (1996-2003). Did Roggensack really hear about 340 cases a year on average in that time?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked Roggensack&rsquo;s campaign for backup, its opening argument was unimpressive. We were told the number in the ad probably was off.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCampaign consultant Brandon Scholz said he came up with the 2,400 figure himself without a full understanding of court statistics. After a couple days of consulting with experts, though, he presented us with a number -- 2,500 -- based on an extrapolation from one year of case termination statistics from the whole of District 4.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe campaign could not provide a record of how many opinions Roggensack wrote, or orders she issued. Instead, it attributed to her a caseload figure that any of the five judges in District 4 would have had if cases were distributed equally among the judges.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot a promising start, but we don&rsquo;t render a verdict until all the evidence is in.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo we gave it our own review.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo evaluate her formula, we went over caseload figures for her entire tenure at District 4 and got up to speed on the appeals process.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCases are randomly assigned and judges are given an equal number of cases to screen each month, we found, so it is reasonable to attribute a share of the district caseload to her in order to arrive at an educated guess.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd the cases come in droves, we found. During Roggensack&rsquo;s tenure, she and the other four judges in District 4 disposed of about 7,400 cases. (Her tenure doesn&rsquo;t match up to calendar years so the number is not precise.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe concluded that Roggensack&rsquo;s estimate is based on a reasonable formula that apportions her a share of the overall district caseload.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut there&rsquo;s another way to do this: use the court&rsquo;s internal record-keeping system to come up with a more precise count of cases she handled, rather than a pure estimate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked for help from Judge Richard Brown, the chief judge of the Appeals Court.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown ran a report on how many case opinions Roggensack wrote or supervised. The final result still involved a bit of extrapolation, but we think it&rsquo;s a harder count than the estimate provided by Roggensack&rsquo;s campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown&rsquo;s count: 2,186 -- a figure that is in the ballpark with Roggensack&rsquo;s general &quot;over 2,400&quot; claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe reality is there&rsquo;s no indisputable count available.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, it&rsquo;s worth noting that Roggensack describes her workload as cases she &quot;heard.&quot; That&rsquo;s not a legal term, and it&rsquo;s therefore a subjective matter to decide what it covers. But there are nuances here that require some clarification.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRoggensack counts several types of cases to get to &quot;over 2,400.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe included cases in which the judges review legal briefs by the parties, decide the case, and then author or contribute to signed opinions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd she counted cases in which judges decide but turn over the writing to staff attorneys, typically when decisions are deemed obvious and noncontroversial.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA large majority of the cases she takes credit for hearing are the type in which staff attorneys, not the judges, write the final legal ruling under judicial supervision.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere&rsquo;s another nuance. About half of cases not authored by the judges result in orders known as summary dispositions, not full-blown written opinions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor some perspective, we turned to <a href=\"http://www.wicourts.gov/courts/appeals/judges/retired/dykman.htm\">Charles Dykman, </a>a judge who served with Roggensack in District 4, which covers 24 counties in western and central Wisconsin. Dykman was presiding judge for much of Roggensack&rsquo;s tenure there, which means he was actively involved in managing caseloads.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDykman, who retired in 2010 after 32 years on the appeals bench, told us the only number he kept track of was majority opinions he authored -- about 1,900 over 32 years. That&rsquo;s a much narrower way to view it than Roggensack chose.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDykman said it was &quot;foolishness&quot; to equate complex cases heard by three-judge panels with minor summary disposition cases in which the appeal often lacked merit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, Dykman said Roggensack could reasonably claim having &quot;heard&quot; those types of cases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, we note that the number Roggensack used did not include a relatively large category of decisions that appeals court judges make in motions that fall short of full-blown appeals. Some of those decisions are fairly complex and time-consuming, said Paul Lundsten, the current presiding judge in District 4.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose, however, are not separate cases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRoggensack&rsquo;s TV ad says she &quot;heard&quot; more than 2,400 cases as a Wisconsin appeals court judge. That&rsquo;s over a seven-year span.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe figure turns out to be an estimate, not an actual count. A harder count put the number at 2,186, though it, too, includes some assumptions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe count includes minor and major cases, and a large number in which the judge&rsquo;s decision is written up by staff attorneys. But they are all cases reviewed and decided by the judge -- in essence &quot;heard&quot; -- and Roggensack made no claim that her number involved only judge-authored opinions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo with the clarifications noted, we rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-02-14T18:33:43.728299", "ruling_date": "2013-02-17T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Roggensack says her Appeals Court caseload topped 2,400", "ruling_headline_slug": "roggensack-says-her-appeals-court-caseload-topped-", "ruling_link_text": "Decides a lot, authors fewer", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tRoggensack campaign, TV ad, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSvezGA4WSw\">&quot;Start Someplace,&quot;</a>Feb. 6, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Brandon Scholz, Roggensack campaign consultant, Feb. 8 and 11, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with retired Appeals Court Judge Charles Dykman, Feb. 13, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Appeals Court Judge Paul Lundsten, presiding judge, District 4, Feb. 12, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews and research help, Appeals Court Chief Judge Richard Brown, and Jennifer Krapf, administrative assistant to chief judge, Wisconsin Court of Appeals, Feb. 12-13, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Richard Stockbridge, professor, mathematical sciences, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Feb. 8, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Diane Fremgen, Clerk of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, Feb. 7, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWisconsin Court of Appeals, <a href=\"http://www.wicourts.gov/other/appeals/statistical.jsp\">annual caseload statistics</a>, accessed February 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail exchanges with Amanda Todd, spokeswoman, Wisconsin Supreme Court, Feb. 8, 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Wisconsin Supreme Court justice", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Patience ", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 2176, "last_name": "Roggensack", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "patience-roggensack", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Patience_Drake_Roggensack_PFACT.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2176/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://roggensackforjustice.com/about-pat/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays she heard more than 2,400 cases as a Wisconsin appeals court judge<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign TV ad", "statement_date": "2013-02-06", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
