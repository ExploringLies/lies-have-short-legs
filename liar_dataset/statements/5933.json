At the end of his speech, Booker, talking about &quot;the carnage that happens when we fail to live up to the promise of this nation,&quot; told a story about the death of a boy he knew when he first took office in 2006.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile recounting that story, Booker stopped himself and said: &quot;I know the data. I see what&#39;s happening to young minority men in this country. I see how much, when looking from a financial perspective how much we as taxpayers pay, billions of dollars in New Jersey for a prison system or correctional system that doesn&#39;t correct. Recycling the same people over and over and over again. A prison system that is 61 percent African-American even though our state is just 13 percent black.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact New Jersey checked Booker&rsquo;s statistics on the state&rsquo;s prison population and found that he knows the data well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey housed 23,810 people in all of its correctional facilities, including halfway houses and county jails, as of Jan. 3, according to data from the state department of corrections.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf those nearly 24,000 offenders, 61 percent, or 14,469 people, are black. By comparison, 22 percent, or 5,300 inmates, are white and 16 percent, or 3,785 inmates, are Hispanic.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey&rsquo;s prison population, excluding offenders held in a facility for women and another facility for adult male sex offenders, is smaller, with 15,407 inmates. Of that population, 62 percent are black.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow does the racial makeup of the state&rsquo;s prison population compare with the state&rsquo;s overall population?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, 13.7 percent of New Jersey&rsquo;s population is black.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Booker&rsquo;s numbers are right. But we wondered how New Jersey compares with the rest of the nation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBased on estimates from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, nearly 38 percent of prisoners under state and federal jurisdiction at the end of 2010 were black. According to the same data, about 32 percent of prisoners were white and more than 22 percent were Hispanic. The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than one year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOverall, 12.6 percent of the U.S. population is black, according to 2010 census data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJohn M. Paitakes, professor of criminal justice at Seton Hall University, said there are many factors behind these statistics, citing prior records and legal representation. He also noted that profiling and prejudice could be factors, but said, &quot;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s any more in New Jersey than in other areas.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I think before you draw any conclusions you have to look at all those factors to get a realistic picture of what it is,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBooker said New Jersey&rsquo;s prison system is &quot;61 percent African-American even though our state is just 13 percent black.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tData from the state corrections department and U.S. Census Bureau back his statistics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the claim True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo comment on this story, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/politifact_nj_cory_booker_said.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-17T14:51:16.058295", "ruling_date": "2012-05-21T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Cory Booker said black people represent more than 60 percent of New Jersey\u2019s prison population", "ruling_headline_slug": "cory-booker-said-black-people-represent-more-60-pe", "ruling_link_text": "Numbers back this statement", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tYouTube, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEI-WFvR6hg&amp;list=UUm7_gnAkXQA64-qDy-IGK4g&amp;index=5&amp;feature=plcp\">Mayor Cory Booker - AFC 2012 National Policy Summit</a>, uploaded May 8, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Department of Corrections, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/corrections/pages/offender_stats.html\">Offender Statistics</a>, accessed May 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml\">American FactFinder</a>, accessed May 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/34000.html\">State &amp; County QuickFacts: New Jersey</a>, accessed May 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Department of Justice: Bureau of Justice Statistics, <a href=\"http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/p10.pdf\">Prisoners in 2010</a>, revised Feb. 9, 2012 accessed May 16, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Department of Justice: Bureau of Justice Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/jim11st.pdf\">Jail Inmates at Midyear 2011 -</a><br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/jim11st.pdf\">Statistical Tables: April 2012</a>, accessed May 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Deirdre Fedkenheuer, spokeswoman for the <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/corrections/pages/index.shtml\">New Jersey Department of Corrections</a>, May 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Pew Center on the States, <a href=\"http://www.pewstates.org/uploadedFiles/PCS_Assets/2010/Pew_Prison_Count_2010.pdf\">Prison Count 2010</a>, accessed May 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Kara McCarthy, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Justice Statistics, May 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html\">QuickFacts: USA</a>, accessed May 17, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with John M.
