Chris Murphy, has been getting rich in Congress.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad focuses on Social Security and Medicare, but it includes a momentary detour into how much Murphy got paid for his labors in the Capitol.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe narrator asks, &quot;Why is Congressman Chris Murphy lying to you about Linda McMahon and Social Security? Because while Murphy was raking in $1 million in salary, he voted to cut Medicare for current recipients by $716 billion.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAn on-screen visual reads: &quot;Congressman Chris Murphy: $1 million in taxpayer-funded salary.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA reader asked us: Are members of Congress really paid $1 million salaries?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tActually, no. Not even close.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince Jan. 1, 2009, lawmakers have been paid $174,000 a year. The key to understanding the ad&rsquo;s claim comes from the fine print on the screen. It says, &quot;Congressional salaries 2007 through 2012.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the ad is referring to Murphy&rsquo;s cumulative earnings over a six-year period and calling it his &quot;salary.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked a <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%27*2%404P/[%3A%22%40%20%20%0A\">Congressional Research Service paper</a> on lawmakers&rsquo; salaries and found that if you add up the salary earned by Murphy over the six-year period since he was elected to Congress, it does come to more than $1.03 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;He&rsquo;s been in Congress six years, and he&rsquo;s cumulatively been paid $1 million dollars,&quot; said Todd Abrajano, communications director for the McMahon campaign. &nbsp;&quot;It&rsquo;s pretty clear and straightforward.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in our view, that&rsquo;s a ridiculous way of calculating &quot;salary,&quot; which is defined as &quot;a fixed regular payment, typically paid on a monthly or biweekly basis but often expressed as an annual sum.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe tremendous distortion of this claim is that it adds up multiple years and uses a terminology that suggests it is for one year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing their logic, we would say the median household income in the United States is more than $300,000. (The median household earned just over $50,000 in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/income_wealth/cb12-172.html\">according to the Census Bureau</a>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe method for calculating Murphy&rsquo;s salary was disclosed on the screen, but it is in such small type -- and it was calculated in such an unorthodox way -- that the explanation is greatly outweighed by the narration and the visuals.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve never heard of anyone refer to their &quot;salary&quot; as six cumulative years of earnings. By phrasing it this way, the ad is pulling a fast one. We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-18T10:48:57.829638", "ruling_date": "2012-10-19T13:15:35", "ruling_headline": "Linda McMahon says opponent Chris Murphy 'was raking in $1 million in salary' in Congress", "ruling_headline_slug": "linda-mcmahon-says-opponent-chris-murphy-was-rakin", "ruling_link_text": "Do you count six years of earnings as your salary?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tLinda McMahon for Senate, &quot;No Plan&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5SM9kZbb-U&amp;feature=player_embedded\">ad</a>), Oct. 11, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Research Service, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%27*2%404P/[%3A%22%40%20%20%0A\">Salaries of Members of Congress: Recent Actions and Historical Tables</a>,&quot; Oct. 3, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCensus Bureau, &quot;Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2011&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/income_wealth/cb12-172.html\">news release</a>), Sept. 12, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Todd Abrajano, communications director for the McMahon campaign, Oct. 18, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Candidate for U.S. Senate", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Linda", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Connecticut", "id": 2060, "last_name": "McMahon", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "linda-mcmahon", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/McMahon_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2060/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.lindaforsenate2012.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tAs a Member of Congress, Chris Murphy &quot;was raking in $1 million in salary.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign ad", "statement_date": "2012-10-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "U.S. House of Representatives", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Connecticut", "id": 2061, "last_name": "Murphy", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "chris-murphy", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Chris_Murphy_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2061/", "total_count": 6, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://www.chrismurphy.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
