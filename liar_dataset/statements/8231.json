John Kitzhaber has been <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/09/john_kitzhaber_stumps_for_sept.html\">considering</a> whether he&rsquo;ll call the Oregon Legislature back for a special session to look at further cuts to government pensions, some lawmakers are making their opinions known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rep. Sal Esquivel, a Medford Republican, thinks a special session is a bad idea and <a href=\"http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130811/OPINION/308110319/-1/NEWSMAP\">wrote an opinion piece</a> about it, which appeared in The Mail Tribune, a paper in southern Oregon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This sounds like a good idea and an admirable goal on the surface, but it also raises any number of questions,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The most important is obvious &mdash; why wasn&rsquo;t this done during the five-month legislative session that we just adjourned?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Esquivel lists a number of arguments, but one caught our attention straight away: &quot;Every day of a legislative session costs Oregon taxpayers $40,000. That includes paying staff, as well as per diem for legislators. And given the governor&rsquo;s historically poor track record when it comes to special sessions, that is probably not the best use of our limited resources.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We vaguely remembered the last special session, when lawmakers convened to give Nike a tax break, but we didn&rsquo;t remember the bill being so high, so we decided to check it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First we looked through some of The Oregonian&rsquo;s articles about the late 2012 special session to see what we&rsquo;d reported as the cost as then. According to politics reporter Christian Gaston, the per-day cost (and it only lasted a day) of that session was $13,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a long way from what Esquivel quoted. &nbsp;We shot Esquivel a quick email to see if he could point us toward his sources. The price, he said through a staffer, had come from the &quot;Legislative Finance Office.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We checked in with Sandra Rierson, the manager of the Financial Services department, who explained that the price depends on the kind of session you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cost per day of the longer regular sessions comes in at $34,901 a day but a special session is considerably less expensive at $13,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both numbers do not include the basic costs of keeping the Capitol running, which would get spent with or without lawmakers in the building. So why the difference?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the short time frame of a special session, there aren&rsquo;t nearly as many hires. &quot;We try to use existing staff as much as possible,&quot; Rierson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We called Esquivel to get his response. He said he based the statement on numbers he&rsquo;d been given years ago. &quot;I was told in the past by LFO that it was $36,000 per day and that was (six) years ago. I am assuming that that number did in fact go up so I concluded $40,000.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The figure we received, however, was the most recent average-per-day cost available from the finance department so we&rsquo;re sticking with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an opinion piece arguing against a possible special legislative session, Esquivel said a legislative session costs $40,000 a day. In fact, it&rsquo;s closer to $35,000, and that&rsquo;s for regular legislative sessions. Esquivel, however, was making the argument against a special session. The cost per day for that comes in at a much lower $13,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because his opinion piece addresses special sessions in particular, there is no truth to his statement -- not to mention the fact that he didn&rsquo;t use current numbers for regular sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-09-05T19:28:47.345046", "ruling_date": "2013-09-05T16:28:02", "ruling_headline": "Do special legislative sessions set Oregon back $40,000 each day?", "ruling_headline_slug": "do-special-sessions-set-oregon-back-40000-each-day", "ruling_link_text": "Special sessions cost quite a bit less than the regular variety.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Rep.
