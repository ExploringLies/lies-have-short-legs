The focus of the commentary was a five-point list of recommendations. &quot;Black people,&quot; Lemon said, &quot;if you really want to fix the problem, here&#39;s just five things that you should think about doing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The No. 1 item on that list -- &quot;and probably the most important,&quot; he said -- had to do with out-of-wedlock births.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Just because you can have a baby, it doesn&#39;t mean you should,&quot; Lemon said. &quot;Especially without planning for one or getting married first. More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock. That means absent fathers. And the studies show that lack of a male role model is an express train right to prison and the cycle continues.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lemon&rsquo;s commentary inspired a firestorm of criticism on social media -- <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/tweetnado-msnbcs-goldie-taylor-calls-don-lemon-a-turn-coat-mofo/\"><u>the website Mediaite published a sampling</u></a> -- and bloggers took aim at his conclusions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If Lemon really wanted to help the black community, he could start by adopting a deeper understanding of the history, sociology and psychology of his own people,&quot; wrote <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/local/wp/2013/07/29/don-lemons-bootstrap-lecture-disguised-as-tough-love/\"><u>Washington Post blogger Rahiel Tesfamariam</u></a>. &quot;Offering made-for-TV analysis about deeply complex social issues in the manner in which he did is irresponsible and lacks intellectual rigor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can&rsquo;t check Lemon&rsquo;s opinions, but we did want to take a look at the one verifiable fact he offered. Is it correct that &quot;more than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock&quot;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We turned to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which publishes a <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_01.pdf\"><u>report</u></a> every year that includes a wealth of data about births in America. The most recent report, published in August 2012, is based on data from 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report broke down statistics by ethnic groups.

Finally, black children counted in these statistics may have contact outside the household with their biological father.
