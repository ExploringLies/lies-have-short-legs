Hs education track record also includes work for passage of a 2012 charter school amendment and a bipartisan deal to shore up the lottery-funded HOPE scholarship and pre-K programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His challenger, Democratic state Sen. Jason Carter of Atlanta, contends that Deal has shortchanged Georgia&rsquo;s children. He&rsquo;s most critical of $1-billion-a-year-plus austerity cuts to education recommended by Deal in the first three of his four state budgets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carter, who voted for those three budgets, is promising that, if he&rsquo;s elected, he will increase education spending through a three-pronged approach that involves growing the economy, cutting government waste and going after tax cheats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latter proposal peaked the interest of our fact-checkers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the Carter for evidence to back up the candidate&rsquo;s claim. Spokesman Bryan Thomas pointed us to a January report from the state Department of Audits and Account, showing about $4.4 billion in delinquent state taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report&rsquo;s authors estimate that $1.9 billion of the $4.4 billion is uncollected. But Thomas said strong leadership would improve collection of that money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You put the force of the governor&rsquo;s office behind it,&quot; Thomas told The Augusta Chronicle earlier this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a press conference on Aug. 27th, Carter told reporters; &quot;There&rsquo;s $2.5 billion that is uncollected out there from people who are cheating on their taxes, and against whom we aren&rsquo;t enforcing the law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The auditor&rsquo;s report, points out that about $815 million of the $2.5 billion is at least 15 years old &ndash; making it much harder to collect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, that leaves two-thirds of the money apparently there for the taking, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The left-leaning Georgia Budget &amp; Policy Institute isn&rsquo;t so sure the plan is viable. Executive Director Alan Essig points out that once you account for the people and businesses that lack the means to pay, you&rsquo;re left with people who have intentionally dodged their responsibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even when caught, those scofflaws aren&rsquo;t likely to fork over the entire amount owed. Ramping up enforcement will yield more money, but just how much is unclear, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Are we talking about $3 million, $30 million, $300 million?&quot; Essig said. &quot;I don&rsquo;t know what the dollar amount is, and I don&rsquo;t think anyone knows it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carter&rsquo;s proposal to track down delinquent taxpayers is nothing new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia made probably its biggest push to go after tax cheats when Sonny Perdue was governor and Bart Graham was revenue commissioner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We pulled a report that showed Graham identified 420,693 taxpayers that owed a combined $1.6 billion as of September 2003. Some of that debt dated back to 1988.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graham&rsquo;s agency chased down the money on several fronts. For instance, $23 million came in when the state refused to renew alcohol licenses for businesses with outstanding taxes. Another $18.6 million came in when the state began shaming scofflaws by posting their names on the internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All told, the state&rsquo;s two-year vigorous enforcement campaign collected $172.5 million &ndash; just 11 percent of what was owed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is a messier process than (Carter) is suggesting,&quot; said Barbara Neuby, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University who specializes in public budgeting and finance. &quot;There is no automatic money that comes in once letters go out.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s because collection would be handled through regulatory enforcement. The same laws that give state agencies broad powers to enforce taxation give people the right to appeal, Neuby said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hearing process can take months and years, especially if the delinquents hire attorneys to fight enforcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also the matter that some delinquent taxpayers may have legitimate reasons they have not paid &ndash; and therefore do not actually owe, Neuby said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State House Appropriations Committee Chairman Terry England, R-Auburn, said there are complications, even if the state could collect the amount in back taxes that Carter&rsquo;s claiming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Nobody would argue putting it into education,&quot; England said. &quot;But that&rsquo;s one -time funds.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question becomes: What about the next year? he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We circled back out to Thomas about some of the concerns that were expressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Sen. Carter has never said that this is the only way to pay for the education investments we need,&quot; Thomas said. &quot;He has identified it as one of several ways to invest in our schools.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other efforts, such as cutting waste and improving efficiency in government, would provide sustained funding for schools, Thomas said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So where does this leave us?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carter said he believes the state can collect a substantial amount to help education by going after delinquent taxpayers. The state&rsquo;s experience &ndash; and a report from state auditors &ndash; say that may be more challenging than he suggests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carter has a point. But there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot of context missing from his proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-09-22T15:44:41.045976", "ruling_date": "2014-09-23T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Carter's plan to go after tax cheats has challenges", "ruling_headline_slug": "carters-plan-go-after-tax-cheats-has-challenges", "ruling_link_text": "Deadbeats beware?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Atlanta Journal-Constitution Political Insider, &quot;Jason Carter pledges to go after tax <a href=\"http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/08/28/jason-carter-pledges-to-go-after-tax-cheats-to-fund-education/\">cheats</a> to fund education,&quot; Aug. 28, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Augusta Chronicle, &quot;Jason Carter&#39;s plan to fund <a href=\"http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/government/2014-09-02/jason-carters-plan-fund-education-may-not-be-fruitful-he-hopes-experts\">education</a> may not be as fruitful as he hopes, experts say,&quot; Sept. 2, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Barbara Neuby, political science professor at Kennesaw State University, Sept. 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia Department of Audits and Accounts Performance Audit Division, Department of Revenue&rsquo;s Tax Compliance Efforts, January 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia Department of Revenue <a href=\"http://www.hsgac.senate.gov//imo/media/doc/102605Presentation.pdf?attempt=2\">report</a></p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "State Senator", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Jason", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 2327, "last_name": "Carter", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "jason-carter", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Jason_Carter.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2327/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://www.senate.ga.gov/senators/en-US/member.aspx?Member=720&Session=23"}, "statement": "<p><strong>Georgia can substantially increase its funding for education by going after $2.5 billion in uncollected taxes.</strong></p>\r\n", "statement_context": "press conference", "statement_date": "2014-08-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
