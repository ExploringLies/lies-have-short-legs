Kristina Roegner of Hudson and Rep. Ron Maag of Lebanon, depicted their proposals as a matter of &quot;workplace freedom&quot; that would attract jobs.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd contrary to a frequent argument of opponents, <a href=\"http://www.wksu.org/news/story/35442\">Maag asserted that </a><a href=\"http://www.wksu.org/news/story/35442\">workers</a>in so-called right-to-work states make more money.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio wondered how that claim is backed up.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMaag&#39;s staff pointed us to the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a &quot;free market&quot; think tank based in Midland, Mich., that strongly supports right-to-work laws.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIts &quot;<a href=\"http://miworkerfreedom.org/18465\">Michigan Worker Freedom</a>&quot; website says: &quot;Workers in right-to-work states make more. When adjusting for cost of living, workers in right-to-work states have 4.1 percent higher per-capita personal incomes than workers in non-right-to-work states.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe source for that is a <a href=\"http://www.mackinac.org/18216\">posting by James M. Hohman</a>, assistant director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center. He writes that he calculated the adjusted per-capita personal income using a state-by-state cost of living index, and converted personal income figures for all 50 states to the value of Michigan dollars.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Right-to-work states have 4.1 percent higher per-capita personal incomes than non-right-to-work states,&quot; Hohman says.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat conclusion is not widely held, however, even though the evidence is at best mixed on the effect that right-to-work laws have on paychecks and local economies.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNoting that it is difficult to isolate the impact of a single policy, two economists for the generally pro-union <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/page/-/old/briefingpapers/BriefingPaper299.pdf\">Economic Policy Institute conducted an analysis</a>of right-to-work laws using a regression model that controlled for more than 40 factors in addition to the cost of living in different states.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTheir analysis found that wages in right-to-work states are 3.2 percent lower than those elsewhere -- for everyone, not just union members. They concluded that the average full-time, full-year worker in a right-to-work state makes about $1,500 less per year than a similar worker elsewhere.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn states with a right-to-work law, the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324296604578179603136860138.html\">Wall Street Journal </a><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324296604578179603136860138.html\">reported</a>last December, &quot;wages tend to be lower, but job growth stronger, than states that don&#39;t have the law. But gauging how much of this divergence in paychecks and employment is a result of the laws is difficult to do.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Journal said that employees in right-to-work states earned 9.8 percent less than workers in states without such laws, according to an analysis of Labor Department data that did not include health-care and other benefits -- &quot;but proving cause and effect on wages is difficult, since many factors influence what workers are paid in a given locale, such as whether the mix of businesses are concentrated in higher-paying industries.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe meticulously nonpartisan <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42575.pdf\">Congressional Research Service issued a </a><a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42575.pdf\">study</a>last December examining right-to-work laws.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUsing data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, it found that wages in what it called &quot;union security states&quot; were 16.6 percent higher than in right-to-work states.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAmong CRS&#39;s conclusions: &quot;Wages are lower in right-to-work states than union security states&quot; -- and that &quot;historical research has suggested that right-to-work laws have little influence on these differences.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhere does that leave Maag&rsquo;s statement?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome economists who support right-to-work laws say wages are comparable or higher in right-to-work states when cost-of-living differences are taken into account. And Maag correctly cited that research.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut federal data from a nonpartisan government research arm shows that employees in right-to-work states earn less. So does another analysis that tries to hold other things equal.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNone of it shows a definitive relationship between right-to-work laws and economic outcomes, even though (as the Wall Street Journal noted) the laws were first adopted in the South as part of a larger drive to lure factory jobs from the heavily unionized and better paying North.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMaag&rsquo;s statement, like others we have seen surrounding the highly charged right-to-work issue, suggests a cause-and-effect relationship that is not supported by any evidence.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate the statement as Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-05-07T18:49:22.886063", "ruling_date": "2013-05-07T18:47:38", "ruling_headline": "State Rep.
