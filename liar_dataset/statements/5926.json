The words &quot;Associated Press, 4/7/2012&quot; also appear, indicating the ad&rsquo;s source is a news article.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe phrasing and the imagery in the ad suggest Walker opposes equal pay for women who are doing the same jobs as men.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBarrett campaign spokesman Phil Walzak told us the ad refers to an AP <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/walker-signs-slew-of-controversial-bills/article_94dab5ec-8008-11e1-a873-001a4bcf887a.html\">article</a> in the <em>Wisconsin State Journal</em> about several bills signed two days earlier by Walker that Democrats say amounts to a Walker &quot;war on women.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe new law repealed a change -- passed in June 2009 when Democrats controlled state government -- that allowed workers to pursue discrimination claims against their employers in state court.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalzak argued that Walker was saying no to equal pay for women because the new law affects women who suffer workplace discrimination, and that Walker did so &quot;at the highest level&quot; that a governor can, by signing a law. He also argued that the old law, by allowing state court suits, deterred employers from discriminating and penalized those that did. The state&rsquo;s anti-discrimination workplace law, he said, &quot;is only as good as its enforcement.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome employee attorneys contend the new law is a blow to equal pay because it takes away the option of a state lawsuit, which they say is easier and less expensive than one filed in federal court. Moreover, most but not all workplace discrimination claims can be filed in federal court.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the nearly three years the old law was in effect, however, no state lawsuits were filed. We cited that when we rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/27/scott-walker/recall-target-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-work/\">Mostly False</a> a Walker claim that the law was a &quot;gravy train&quot; for lawyers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also pointed out -- in rating <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/10/kathleen-falk/dem-wisconsin-governor-recall-says-gop-backed-bill/\">False</a> a claim by former Democratic recall candidate Kathleen Falk that women &quot;can&rsquo;t do something&quot; about pay discrimination -- that a federal suit for damages is an option for most discriminated workers; and that all workers claiming discrimination can seek &quot;make whole&quot; remedies, such as back pay, through a state or federal agency.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd we rated <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/12/cory-mason/wisconsin-gop-bill-would-repeal-law-ensuring-pay-e/\">Mostly False</a> a statement by state Rep.

But such discrimination remains illegal and women who believe they are paid less because of their gender still have three options for pursuing their claims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Barrett&rsquo;s claim False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>(You may comment on this item on the <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/politifact-testing-barrett-claim-walker-said-no-to-equal-pay-9f5erpf-151866955.html\">Journal Sentinel&#39;s web page</a>)</em></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-05-16T16:23:11.560276", "ruling_date": "2012-05-17T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin recall challenger Tom Barrett says Gov.
