That was bigger than the other Republican candidates are getting, in terms of crowd size.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s own Twitter timeline tells much of the story behind the event, with the rest of the details filled in by journalists&rsquo; accounts and our interviews with public officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event, hosted by the Maricopa County Republican Party (home to Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the immigration hard-liner who spoke before Trump), was supposed to be at the Arizona Biltmore resort hotel. But with larger-than-expected crowds, the campaign <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/07/09/trump-event-moves-convention-center/29938793/\">moved the event</a> to the Phoenix Convention Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump was excited about the buzz on the day before his Saturday speech, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/619733816618291204\">tweeting</a>, &quot;Look forward to being in Phoenix tomorrow at 2:00 P.M. Hottest ticket in entire country. Was supposed to be 500 people, now many thousands!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Media previews of the speech mentioned anywhere from 3,500-9,000 people were planning to come to the speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As organizers began letting people in, a line <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/07/11/live-donald-trump-phoenix-coverage/30018843/\">wrapped</a> around the convention center. Many people &mdash; hard to say how many, though some reports put it around 1,000&nbsp;&mdash; were turned away.<em> Arizona Republic</em> national political reporter Dan Nowicki describes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dannowicki/status/619991285986791424\">&quot;bedlam in the ballroom</a>&quot; as Trump took the stage an hour after the planned start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In between <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/07/13/trumps-trash-talk-the-23-people-and-institutions-he-slammed-in-a-single-speech/\">insulting 23 people or things</a> in his speech, as counted by the Washington Post, Trump also remarked about the size of the crowd. According to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/11/politics/donald-trump-phoenix-rally/\">CNN</a>, Trump said, &quot;This is unbelievable. This began as 500 people in a ballroom in Phoenix.&quot; He also said the crowd &quot;blows away&quot; crowds for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, whose recent crowds are drawing <a href=\"http://time.com/3947693/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-crowds/\">headlines.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how big was Trump&rsquo;s showing? The<em> Post</em> put the crowd size at <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-tells-supporters-we-need-to-take-back-the-heart-of-our-country/2015/07/11/066aecf2-27dd-11e5-b77f-eb13a215f593_story.html\">4,200</a>. CNN guessed around 5,000, quoting the Trump campaign as saying 15,000 tickets were distributed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s not what Trump saw. Trump toasted the crowd on his Facebook page that night, writing, &quot;This is what 15,000 people looks like.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/w0UikDddficMG_2xZBMlMQX9r8n4NP6hsFHXHCYxxQQv72GMxnZk_dg4Kj45jHkvLkom-KuqPhX67xLyZ0Z1gBlT-f5WG_Q3HRK4L-7E3jPLI2OYVB59U6Gbbz9mkkVfj2W5dF4\" style=\"border:none; height:680px; width:510px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>City officials started pushing back on Trump&rsquo;s claim. In a statement shared with PunditFact, the city fire department said capacity for the North Ballroom was 4,200 people. The doors were closed at 4,169 attendees, said&nbsp;Phoenix Fire Department spokeswoman Shelly Jamison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Once that capacity was reached, we closed the doors,&quot; she said. &quot;The Phoenix Convention Center has a fire prevention specialist who is an expert on large events (e.g. Super Bowl Fan Fest, Comicon, etc) assigned specifically to the Phoenix Convention Center to enforce fire code compliance.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brahm Resnik, a TV reporter with 12 News in Arizona, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brahmresnik/status/620050115861086208\">questioned</a> on Twitter why Trump would exaggerate an already respectable crowd size as he fact-checked Trump&rsquo;s crowd-size claims <a href=\"http://www.12news.com/story/news/local/valley/2015/07/12/donald-trump-says-phoenix-violated-fire-code-to-expand-crowd-size/30051767/\">in his reports</a>.

He doubled down, tweeting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/620220652189040640\">July 12</a>, &quot;Convention Center officials in Phoenix don&#39;t want to admit that they broke the fire code by allowing 12-15,000 people in 4,000 code room.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also: &quot;Phoenix Convention Center officials did not want to have thousands of people standing outside in the heat, so they let them in. A GREAT day!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For comparison sake, here is an image of the Bryce Jordan Center, home to Penn State University&rsquo;s basketball team. Its listed seating capacity is just over 15,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qz3F_7PvZ5ihzlrf557uSxz4yxlatSmx86k7TIErQdsHbQ08gRYCEdZrpfozHBY0RAbl51gaXob353s--yATobBuakBFJO3gw0E0sODnp_uTlqASHF8-2RYLRnyMoD_Asxjob70\" style=\"border:none; height:215px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And here&rsquo;s the widest picture of Trump&rsquo;s Phoenix speech that we could locate.
