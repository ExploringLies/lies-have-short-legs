Reilly chose to roll all the UW campuses into one, which as we shall see has limitations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat said, Reilly made clear that his figure was system-wide, so ultimately we&rsquo;ll focus on that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe turned to <a href=\"http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/comm/rep/Z/ecstatereport11-12/\">salary figures </a>collected annually by the <a href=\"http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/about/\">American Association of University Professors</a>, a member organization established &quot;to advance academic freedom and shared governance, to define fundamental professional values and standards for higher education, and to ensure higher education&#39;s contribution to the common good.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe group&rsquo;s figures for instructional faculty pay, gleaned from its surveys of institutions for 2011-&rsquo;12, are widely quoted, notably in salary comparisons compiled and analyzed by the Chronicle of Higher Education.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReilly didn&rsquo;t make clear whether UW&rsquo;s &quot;peers&quot; include competing private schools, or just public, so we&rsquo;ll examine both.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor 11 of the UW System&rsquo;s four-year campuses, the AAUP peer group is master&rsquo;s-granting schools. The Madison and Milwaukee campuses are compared to a more select group, doctoral institutions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"https://chronicle.com/article/faculty-salaries-table-2012/131433\">Chronicle of Higher Education site </a>shows that all but one of the UW System&rsquo;s 13 four-year campuses pay professor salaries that are &quot;far below&quot; the national median for full professors at public, private and independent institutions of similar type. Madison is the lone exception; average pay for full professors there ($114,690) is merely &quot;below&quot; the median for doctoral institutions. Figures are for full-time professors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPay at 11 of the 13 schools for another group of faculty -- assistant professors, which is considered the entry level -- was &quot;below&quot; or &quot;far below&quot; the national median. At the other two, it was <em>above</em> the national median -- Madison ($75,860) and Whitewater ($62,178).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the UW System&rsquo;s 13 two-year campuses, professors of all types collectively are paid &quot;far below&quot; the national median, the salary figures show. The <a href=\"http://www.uwc.edu/\">two-year campuses </a>include schools such as such as Rock County, Fox Valley, Waukesha and Barron County.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s quantify the size of the gap.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the flagship Madison campus, full professors collectively would need a 4 percent to 5 percent raise to reach national averages, depending on whether independent and private schools are included in the comparison, according to calculations we did using the AAUP data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssistant professors at Madison, by contrast, are 4 percent to 6 percent <em>above</em> the national averages.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Madison stands alone as coming close to the national averages in both categories.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the state&rsquo;s only other public doctoral institution, runs 24 percent to 27 percent below national levels for full professors, with average pay of $95,570. Assistant-professor pay there runs 6 percent to 8 percent behind.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe other 11 four-year campuses range from 15 percent to 33 percent below average for full professors. Full professor pay at the four-year campuses (not including Madison and Milwaukee) ranged from $67,008 to $75,857.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAssistant professor pay at 10 of the 11 fell short by 5 percent to 19 percent (with Whitewater the only school above the median).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose two positions -- full professor and assistant -- don&rsquo;t comprise the entire faculty.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReilly&rsquo;s specific claim was not about individual schools, or groups of schools, but that system-wide faculty pay has fallen 18 percent below the national average.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked AAUP&rsquo;s research director, John Curtis, to calculate a system-wide figure, one that rolls up all the campuses into one amount, and includes all types of full-time faculty, including associate professors, instructors and lecturers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBased on his figures, we found a collective 20 percent faculty pay gap between UW System salaries and those at similar public, private and independent schools.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe gap is 18 percent for just the four-year, public Wisconsin campuses (leaving aside the two-year schools).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReilly&rsquo;s office told us he, too, relied on the AAUP figures to reach his conclusion. His spokesman, David Giroux, provided <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/UW+data.pdf\">detailed comparisons </a>that also factored in a cost-of-living adjustment based on geography. In addition, Reilly&rsquo;s approach compared schools with a select peer group rather than all schools of the same general type.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe bottom line from the UW-provided data: It reaches very similar conclusions to the analysis by Curtis. There was one major exception. Reilly&rsquo;s analysis put UW-Madison professor salaries much further below the median.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur bottom line: Reilly&rsquo;s math appears to be on target.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCurtis cautioned that a system-wide number may signal a disparity in a broad sense, but really is not very meaningful for addressing pay institution-by-institution because the overall figure combines a wide range of institutions of different types.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA system-wide look does not shed light on pay differences by field, either -- history professors vs. engineering professors, etc.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tReilly said &quot;faculty salaries at UW System institutions have now fallen more than 18 percent below the national average.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe aggregate figure has its limitations as a precise guide for future action, but Reilly scores with this broad comparison, which suggests a significant disparity.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate his claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-12-19T14:09:03.129550", "ruling_date": "2012-12-26T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "UW System president says salaries are 18 percent below national average ", "ruling_headline_slug": "uw-system-president-says-salaries-are-18-percent-b", "ruling_link_text": "Not for everybody, but accurate in the aggregate", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tUW System President Kevin Reilly, <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/reillyspeech.doc\">transcript </a>of remarks on pay, to Board of Regents, Dec. 7, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmerican Association of University Professors, <a href=\"http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/comm/rep/Z/ecstatereport11-12/\">&quot;2011-12 Report on the Economic Status of the Profession,&quot;</a> accessed Dec. 11, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmerican Association of University Professors, <a href=\"http://media.jsonline.com/documents/AAUP.xls\">&quot;Average Salary of Full-Time Instructional Faculty, University of Wisconsin System and National,</a>&quot;
