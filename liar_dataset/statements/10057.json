PolitFact Georgia decided to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nunn&rsquo;s claim is designed to bolster her bipartisan bona fides - and showcase where she agrees with conservatives such as Georgia&rsquo;s two current senators, Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson, and powerful groups, such as the Georgia and American farm bureaus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Perdue and Nunn have said they want to serve on the Senate agriculture committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her claim is based on statements that Perdue made in February, when he was running in the crowded GOP primary. Of the seven Republicans running, only U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Savannah, said he supported the farm bill. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time of that&nbsp; debate, Nunn had already voiced her support for the measure, which took more than two years to pass, as well as her intent to seek a seat on the Senate&rsquo;s agriculture committee, said her spokesman Nathan Click.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While David Perdue opposed the Farm Bill -- the No. 1 legislative priority for Georgia farmers -- &nbsp;Michelle Nunn has said since the beginning of this campaign that fighting for Georgia farmers is one of her top priorities,&quot; Click said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lawmakers across the political spectrum supported the farm bill largely because of the importance of agriculture in various states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isakson and Chambliss both supported the final bill, with Chambliss taking the floor of the Senate to urge others to vote with him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There is no single piece of legislation that impacts as many people in my state as this one,&quot; said Chambliss, a former agriculture lawyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opposition came mostly from the far-left and far-right of each party. Democrats who voted against the bill complained about $8.6 billion cut over a decade to food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. Republican opponents claimed those cuts did not go far enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perdue sides with the GOP opponents to the measure, said spokesman Derrick Dickey. He believes that Congress missed an opportunity for a broader overhaul of the food stamp program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We have seen exponential growth in food stamps throughout the years,&quot; Dickey said. &quot;David supports a discussion focused on getting those people back to work, separate from protections from farmers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That sort of debate would require a bifurcated bill, to fund agriculture and nutrition. An effort to do just that failed in Congress before lawmakers rallied behind the compromise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that history, it is clear that Nunn is correct to say Perdue did not support the 2014 farm bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it is an overreach to imply that opposition to the bill translates into opposition to farmers or agriculture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate her claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-10T15:52:17.097921", "ruling_date": "2014-10-13T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Nunn mostly right about Perdue's opposition to farm bill", "ruling_headline_slug": "nunn-right-about-perdues-opposition-farm-bill", "ruling_link_text": "Being against the farm bill isn't the same as opposing farmers", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Roll Call, &quot;<a href=\"http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/farm-bill-finally-passes-the-house/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Farm bill finally passes the House</u></a>,&quot; Jan. 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com//story/2014/02/farm-bill-usda-103270.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Farm bill signed; USDA on the clock,</u></a>&quot; Feb. 7, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atlanta Business Chronicle, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/blog/capitol_vision/2014/02/senate-gop-hopefuls-stick-together-in.html?page=all\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Senate GOP hopefuls stick together in Gainesville,</u></a>&quot; Feb. 23, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. House of Representatives <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll031.xml\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Roll Call Vote on 2014 Farm Bill</u></a>, Jan. 29, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Senate <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00021\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Roll Call Vote on Farm Bill 2014</u></a>, Feb. 4, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Farm Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.fb.org/index.php?action=newsroom.news&amp;year=2014&amp;file=nr0207.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>statement on 2014 farm bill</u></a>, accessed Oct. 8, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saxby Chambliss <a href=\"http://www.chambliss.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/floorstatements?ID=7713b83f-5857-4c73-8f6c-e182e2c9061c\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>floor statement on 2014 farm bill</u></a>, Feb. 14, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michelle Nunn <a href=\"http://www.michellenunn.com/news/articles/michelle-nunn-highlights-david-perdues-washington-hypocrisy-on-farm-bill\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>statement on farm bill</u></a>, Aug. 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Derrick Dickey, spokesman for Republican U.S. Senate Candidate David Perdue, Oct. 8, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email and phone interview with Nathan Click, spokesman for Democratic U.S. Senate Candidate Michelle Nunn, Oct. 8, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "Chief Executive Officer, Points of Light Foundation", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Michelle", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 2356, "last_name": "Nunn", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "michelle-nunn", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Michelle_Nunn2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2356/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>David Perdue did not support the 2014 farm bill that U.S. Sens.
