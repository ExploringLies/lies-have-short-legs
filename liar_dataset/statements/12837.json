No Republican is running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But although she worked with prosecutors in the Fresno County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office in California, even Swanigan doesn&rsquo;t say she worked as a prosecutor. Neither does the office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the ad says</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad is sponsored by Milwaukeeans for Self-Governance, which the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> has described as a <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/secretive-group-tries-to-remake-milwaukee-city-hall-b99698985z1-374442461.html\">secretive group</a> led by longtime conservative political operative <a href=\"http://www.zigmanjoseph.com/#!lets_talk/con8\">Craig Peterson</a>. In the April 2016 City of Milwaukee elections, the group ran attack ads against Mayor <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/tom-barrett-campaign-responds-with-attack-ads-against-bob-donovan-tom-barrett-campaign-responds-with-371329031.html\">Tom Barrett</a>, who easily won re-election, and backed the opponents of at least <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/secretive-group-tries-to-remake-milwaukee-city-hall-b99698985z1-374442461.html\">two Milwaukee aldermen</a>, both of whom were re-elected. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swanigan&rsquo;s latest <a href=\"http://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/0105663JulyContinuing20165cffc715201692635PMGAB2Report.pdf\">campaign finance report</a>, filed in July 2016, says Peterson printed $476 worth of campaign brochures for her. Her <a href=\"http://cfis.wi.gov/ReportsOutputFiles/0105663JanuaryContinuing2016f3b35119201692338PMGAB2Report.pdf\">previous report</a> says Peterson contributed $250 to her campaign and provided $1,681 in printing and food and beverages for a Swanigan fundraiser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad makes several attacks on Chisholm before making the claim we&rsquo;re checking. It was included in this section:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Verona Swanigan is licensed to practice law in five states, holds a master&rsquo;s degree in forensic psychology, has worked as a prosecutor, and a probation and parole officer, and she is the daughter of a 32-year veteran of the Milwaukee Police Department. She has never lost a trial. The current DA has never even taken a bar exam.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The <em>Journal Sentinel</em> <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/07/31/john-chisholm-faces-off-democratic-challenger-verona-swanigan/87891810/\">reported</a> that in the only Wisconsin felony case Swanigan ever tried, a jury found her client not guilty of sexual assault of a child. As for the allusion to Chisholm, graduates of the University of Wisconsin Law School and Marquette University Law School <a href=\"https://www.wicourts.gov/services/attorney/bardiploma.htm\">do not have to take</a> the bar exam to practice law in Wisconsin. Chisholm is a UW law graduate.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the claim we&rsquo;re checking, Peterson told us that while employed by the Fresno DA, Swanigan &quot;filed cases, extradition motions and documentation,&quot; and made court appearances, which sounds like some of the things prosecutors do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What they say</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fresno County Assistant District Attorney Steve Wright told us Swanigan was classified as a legal assistant/paralegal when she worked in the office from March to December 2006. He said he did not know her job duties, but that she was not a sworn prosecutor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swanigan had earned her law degree from Northern Illinois University in 2005, but hadn&rsquo;t yet passed the California bar exam when she was hired in Fresno.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said that under the program she worked in, she filed criminal complaints, although they were done in the name of a sworn prosecutor; and made court appearances on her own, though under the supervision of a prosecutor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike Peterson, Swanigan said she would not call herself a former prosecutor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I personally would not describe it that way,&quot; Swanigan told us, referring to the ad. &quot;He could make a legal argument for it to be described that way, but I would not.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the <a href=\"http://www.swaniganforda.com/about-1/\">biographical section</a> of Swanigan&rsquo;s campaign website says she worked at the Fresno County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office, but no position is listed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukeeans for Self-Governance says in a radio ad that Swanigan &quot;has worked as a prosecutor.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swanigan made court appearances and assisted prosecutors in other ways when she worked in the the Fresno County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office in California. But she was classified as a paralegal, not a sworn prosecutor, and does not describe herself as a former prosecutor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-01T16:37:05.577074", "ruling_date": "2016-08-04T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Candidate for district attorney doesn't say she worked as a prosecutor, but radio ad says she did ", "ruling_headline_slug": "candidate-district-attorney-doesnt-say-she-worked-", "ruling_link_text": "Not even the candidate says she did", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Interview and email, Craig Peterson, July 28-29, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Verona Swanigan, July 29, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Fresno County Assistant District Attorney Steve Wright, July 29, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Verona Swanigan campaign website, <a href=\"http://www.swaniganforda.com/about-1/\">biographical section</a>, accessed July 28, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/07/31/john-chisholm-faces-off-democratic-challenger-verona-swanigan/87891810/\">&quot;John Chisholm faces off with Democratic challenger Verona Swanigan,&quot;</a> July 31, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3630, "last_name": "Milwaukeeans for Self-Governance", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "milwaukeeans-self-governance", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/mugs_mug-independentgroup__________________.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3630/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says Milwaukee County district attorney candidate Verona Swanigan &quot;has worked as a prosecutor.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a radio ad", "statement_date": "2016-07-20", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 38, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/38/", "subject": "Crime", "subject_slug": "crime", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 177, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/177/", "subject": "Criminal Justice", "subject_slug": "criminal-justice", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/5/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": "Did Verona Swanigan, who is running against Milwaukee County DA John Chisholm, ever work as a prosecutor?"}
