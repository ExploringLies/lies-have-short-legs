Scott Turner, R-Frisco, speaking Jan. 8, 2014, at a Texas Public Policy Foundation conference in Austin, said he <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/player/scottturner/2503427/profile\"><u>made it to the NFL</u></a> despite being sidelined through his first three seasons as a student-athlete at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turner, lately an aspirant for speaker of the Texas House, said he thrived as a player only after agreeing to switch from offensive positions to defensive back. Referring to his senior season, Turner said: &quot;I started the whole year, led the team in interceptions and tackles from defensive back.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s quite an accomplishment in that many defenders can pile up tackles and interceptions. We were curious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The online 2013 Illinois<a href=\"http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/ill/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2013-14/misc_non_event/2013_FB_RecordBook5.pdf\"><u> Football Record Book</u></a> from the university does not show Turner leading the Fighting Illini in tackles or interceptions in any seasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At our request, Derek Neal, a University of Illinois spokesman, checked the football program&rsquo;s &quot;archive book&quot; for the 1994 season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By phone, Neal confirmed that Turner started each of that season&rsquo;s games at cornerback but said other players led the team in tackles and interceptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turner had 48 tackles, Neal said. Seven players had more: three linebackers, two safeties, a defensive end and defensive tackle. Dana Howard, a linebacker, led with 150 tackles, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turner had two interceptions that season, Neal said, as did three other players. Another cornerback, Robert Crumpton, led the team with four interceptions, Neal said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we obtained these figures, Turner told us he&rsquo;d intended to indicate that he led players at his position--cornerback--in tackles and interceptions; he said by phone that he&rsquo;d forgotten he trailed a fellow cornerback in interceptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I know that defensive backs never lead the team in tackles. If you do, that&rsquo;s a horrible team... If I misspoke, obviously, I apologize for that,&quot; Turner said. &quot;I don&rsquo;t need to embellish the truth. I played.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turner said he started every game of his senior season, leading the team in tackles and interceptions from defensive back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turner indeed started every game. But he finished eighth in tackles and tied for second in interceptions with several players. He also did not lead defensive backs in either category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim as Mostly False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>MOSTLY FALSE </em></strong><em>&ndash; The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"> <u>more</u></a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-01-13T14:32:51.202515", "ruling_date": "2014-01-15T16:19:53", "ruling_headline": "Scott Turner, House speaker hopeful, didn't lead college team in tackles, interceptions", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-turner-house-speaker-hopeful-didnt-lead-coll", "ruling_link_text": "But he started every game in '94", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Publication, &quot;I, the Record Book,&quot; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2013 (accessed Jan. 13, 2014)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone interview, Derek Neal, associate director of athletic communications, University of Illinois, Champaign, Jan. 13, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone interview, Scott Turner, Frisco, Jan. 13, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Businessman, motivational speaker", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Scott", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 2578, "last_name": "Turner", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "scott-turner", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/turnerscottpft.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2578/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://scottturnerfortexas.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;I started the whole year&quot; as a senior on the University of Illinois football team and &quot;led the team in interceptions and tackles from defensive back.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech", "statement_date": "2014-01-08", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 216, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/216/", "subject": "Sports", "subject_slug": "sports", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/", "/api/v/2/edition/5/", "/api/v/2/edition/1/", "/api/v/2/edition/13/", "/api/v/2/edition/7/", "/api/v/2/edition/9/", "/api/v/2/edition/6/", "/api/v/2/edition/2/", "/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
