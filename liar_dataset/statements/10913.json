Employment in both agricultural and nonagricultural industries is included.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">In contrast, the federal government&#39;s oft-quoted payroll survey of employers &quot;covers only wage and salary employees on the payrolls of nonfarm establishments.&quot; By this other metric, Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist for the bureau, told us, Texas netted 1.2 million additional jobs from December 2007 to December 2014. In the period, she said, 24 states had net decreases in total civilian employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">But again, those figures weren&rsquo;t total employment, the indicator chosen by Perry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">After Perry declared for president, we circled back to Abbot, who emailed us data indicating that from December 2007 to December 2014, Texas saw an increase in total employment of 1,572,694; the nation as a whole had a surge of 1,169,000. Put another way, but for Texas, the nation would have experienced a total employment decrease of 403,694.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">When we looked into Perry&rsquo;s seven-year contrast before, analyst<a href=\"http://www.epi.org/people/david-cooper/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> David Cooper</a> of the liberal Economic Policy Institute commented that the timeframe singled out by Perry may deliver a more glowing contrast for Texas than other periods. According to the government&rsquo;s payroll surveys, he said, the country had added 9.1 million jobs since June 2009, the acknowledged end of the national recession, with Texas accounting for 1.5 million of the additions. Significantly, he said, the rest of the country as a whole lost jobs from June 2009 until February 2010. Since then, he said, the U.S. had added more than 10 million jobs with Texas (again) accounting for more than 1 million of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">At the time, Professor Perry said that in his view, the best comparison of Texas to the rest of the nation starts in December 2007. His point: &quot;Texas never experienced significant job losses during the Great Recession, while the rest of the country did,&quot; he emailed. &quot;Therefore, comparing job gains since June 2009 or Feb. 2010 really won&rsquo;t make much sense. Of course the non-Texas US gained a lot of jobs since June 2009, and more than Texas, but that&rsquo;s because Texas never lost any (very many) jobs in 2008 and 2009 like the rest of the country. Texas is a great economic success story, and an anomaly vs. the rest of the country regarding job losses/gains,&quot; he wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">Also at the time, Abbot said by email Perry&rsquo;s claim could have been precise by referring to &quot;total civilian employment&quot; rather than jobs. That said, as of November 2014, Abbot said, 24 other states had yet to reach pre-recession employment levels. &quot;On a statewide basis, Texas by far leads all states, with total civilian employment growth of 1,410,440. California is a distant second with civilian (household) employment growth of 452,763,&quot; Abbot wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">Perry said: &quot;In the last seven years of my tenure, Texas created 1.5 million new jobs.
