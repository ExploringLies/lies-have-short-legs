Check.</p>\r\n<p>Plus, no  Republican has lost statewide since &lsquo;94, Republicans hold solid  majorities in the Texas Senate and Texas congressional delegation and  the GOP could widen its edge in the Texas House in November&rsquo;s elections.</p>\r\n<p>Check,  check, check and (maybe) check.</p>\r\n<p>Such pro-Republican realities  didn&rsquo;t deter a candidate for the chairmanship of the Republican Party of  Texas from sending out a press release May 27 generally charging the  current chair, Cathie Adams of Dallas, with poor management. Tom Mechler  of Amarillo also let loose with this: &ldquo;The Democrats have over 20 field agents  to our 0.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Really? The GOP's forces outnumbered?</p>\r\n<p>Before  imagining wild scenarios&mdash;operatives speeding country roads, texting on  the straightaways&mdash;keep in mind that a political &ldquo;field agent&rdquo; is simply a  person entrusted with representing a party, interest group or candidate  in a region or community. Agents are an entity&rsquo;s eyes and ears,  expected to track what matters to local residents and to fan support for  their client in election years, like this one.</p>\r\n<p>Responding to our  inquiry, Mechler spokesman Russ Duerstine, a member of the State  Republican Executive Committee, told us the state GOP let its only field  organizer go early this year, a claim that a party spokesman declined  to address. Later, Mechler said he reached his count, which he called an  estimate, by looking at Texas-based workers for Republican and  Democratic political groups, which seemed like a reasonable methodology.</p>\r\n<p>Starting our own check, we perused the major parties' websites.  The Texas Democratic Party site lists 19 staff members though no one  with a title indicating they work outside of its Austin headquarters.  The state GOP&rsquo;s site lists six staff members, likewise no one with a  title suggesting they&rsquo;re in the field.</p>\r\n<p>Next, we contacted the  parties. GOP spokesman Bryan Preston declined comment on the party's  field staff, while Kirsten Gray, spokeswoman for the Democrats, said in  an email the party now has no field staffers but some staff members  occasionally go into the field.</p>\r\n<p>End of story? Not.</p>\r\n<p>In  April 2009, the Democratic National Committee dispatched an organizer,  Luke Hayes, to Texas to direct the state&rsquo;s chapter of Organizing for  America, the national group that succeeded then-Sen. Barack Obama&rsquo;s 2008  presidential campaign committee, Obama for America. At the time, the  Austin American-Statesman said there was speculation in Democratic  circles about the national party putting up to 30 organizers into  Republican-leaning Texas. That apparently hasn&rsquo;t happened, though an  Austin Democratic activist, Eugene Sepulveda, posted a blog in August  saying he&rsquo;d attended an event including &ldquo;12 or 14&rdquo; Texas-based OFA field  organizers.</p>\r\n<p>Hector Nieto, spokesman for Organizing for America &ndash;  Texas, declined to say how many staffers are in the state. Separately,  though, we looked through DNC financial filings with the Federal  Election Commission. The committee&rsquo;s &ldquo;disbursements&rdquo; filing for April,  the latest report available, shows salaries paid to 11 individuals with  Texas addresses; add Hayes, whose listed address is in the Bronx, and  there appear to have been 12 DNC-paid staff members in the state.  According to the filing, those payees were spread among Austin, Houston,  Brownsville, Dallas, El Paso, Garland, La Feria and Lorena.</p>\r\n<p>A  similar filing by the Republican National Committee revealed no  committee-paid Texas workers in April, though a Dallas resident was paid  consulting, speaking and training fees.</p>\r\n<p>So, the count of  D-vs.-R organizers appears to be 12 to 0.</p>\r\n<p>But hold on. State  Comptroller Susan Combs, a Republican seeking her third term in  November, has announced she'll be helming the GOP's election-year  get-out-the-vote committee, dubbed Victory 2010. On the Republican side,  such committees usually enlist field staff. The GOP's 2008 \"victory\"  committee paid six field workers, according to Leanne Ivey, that  committee's senior adviser. Ivey said the workers were based in Fort  Worth, Dallas, Houston (which had two), San Antonio and Central Texas.</p>\r\n<p>And  Democrats have more afoot as well. The Texas Democratic Trust and Lone  Star Fund funnel money to pro-Democratic groups. For the six months that  ended Dec. 31, we identified about a dozen individuals or companies  with Texas addresses that fielded payments from at least one of the  entities, according to finance reports filed with the state and federal  government. But no recipients were precisely listed as field staff.</p>\r\n<p>Finally,  we&rsquo;d be remiss if we overlooked field-staff hirings by the party&rsquo;s  well-funded candidates for governor. GOP Gov. Rick Perry&rsquo;s campaign told  us he has 10 regional field directors. Democratic nominee Bill White&rsquo;s  campaign didn&rsquo;t volunteer its field staff level. Spokeswoman Katy Bacon  said in an email: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s competitive information, kind of like the  recipe for Dr Pepper.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>We visited again with Mechler, who said  for his count, he assumed that 75 percent of the individuals funded in  Texas by the Lone Star Fund and Texas Democratic Trust were field  workers. He stood by his 20-to-0 ratio, calling it a fair estimate.</p>\r\n<p>We're  comfortable saying Democrats have up to a dozen people working in the  field. And the state GOP has no one.</p>\r\n<p>Also, it's possible some workers in both parties aren't identified as  field staff in finance reports. It's also likely that future hires  will change the ratio of ground troops.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Based on available information, Mechler is right about his  party for now, but overstates Democratic Party numbers. We rate his  statement Half True.</p>\r\n<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-04T12:24:39.456277", "ruling_date": "2010-06-04T15:06:17", "ruling_headline": "Challenger to GOP chair says Democrats have 20 field agents, Republicans have none", "ruling_headline_slug": "challenger-gop-chair-says-democrats-have-20-field-", "ruling_link_text": "For now, more like 12 to 0", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Austin American-Statesman,  news article, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/05052009_statesmannewsstory.doc\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Democrat  trucks across Texas to fuel Obama effort,&rdquo;</a> May 5, 2009</p>\r\n<p>DNC  Services Corporation/Democratic National  Committee, <a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00010603/471149/\" target=\"_blank\">Report  of receipts and disbursements</a> (covering  April 2010), accessed June  1, 2010 <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/06022010_catherinefrazieremail.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/06022010_catherinefrazieremail.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">E-mail</a>,  Catherine Frazier, xx, Rick Perry  campaign, June 2, 2010<a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/05282010_kirstengrayemail\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/05282010_kirstengrayemail\" target=\"_blank\">E-mail</a>,  Kirsten Gray, communications director,  Texas Democratic Party, May 28,  2010</p>\r\n<p>Interview, Leeanne Ivey,  senior adviser, Republican Victory  2008 Committee, June 3, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Lone  Star Fund, <a href=\"http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00269779/449124/\" target=\"_blank\">Report  of Receipts and Disbursements</a> (covering  July through December  2009), accessed June 2, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Tom Mechler,  candidate for chairman,  Republican Party of Texas, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/05272010_tommechlerprrelease.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">press  release</a>, May 27, 2010</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/06012010_hectornietoemail.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">E-mail</a>,  Hector Nieto, Organizing for America &ndash;
