Bush <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JebBush/status/634154396310470656\">tweeted video of the town hall</a> the same night, calling Trump &quot;a tax-hiking Democrat.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his defense, Trump said on <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcripts-august-23-2015-trump-christie-cruz/\"><em>Face The Nation</em> on Aug. 23</a> that living in Manhattan for years affected his alignment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I was from an area that was all Democrat,&quot; Trump said. &quot;And, frankly, over the years, I have &mdash; and especially as I have gotten more and more involved &mdash; I have evolved.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know Trump has changed his political affiliation several times over the years, but we wanted to figure out just when and how the billionaire liked to party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Choosing sides</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has regularly said that he has a broad range of political positions. &quot;I identify with some things as a Democrat,&quot; he <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/249062-trump-i-identify-with-some-things-as-a-democrat\">told MSNBC in July</a>. He had told CNN the same thing <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/21/politics/donald-trump-election-democrat/\">back in 2004</a>. He&rsquo;s also expressed interest in running <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/248910-exclusive-trump-threatens-third-party-run\">as a third-party candidate</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the New York City Board of Elections, Trump has changed his party affiliation five times since registering as a Republican in Manhattan in 1987. A form that year notes he had previously been registered in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens, where he grew up, but his prior affiliation was not identified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s affiliations have gone back and forth since then.

After 12 years as a Republican, he registered with the Independence Party in 1999. That moved Trump to <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/10/25/trump.cnn/index.html?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS\">New York&rsquo;s version of the Reform Party</a>, which is neither Democratic nor Republican. He even won the Reform Party&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/06/16/414609787/5-things-you-should-know-about-donald-trump\">California primary for president in March 2000</a>, despite withdrawing from that contest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush&rsquo;s campaign told us that &quot;the last decade&quot; meant when Trump was registered from 2000 to 2010. Trump was registered as a Democrat for 8 years, 1 month in that time span.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we think a reasonable person could mistake &quot;the last decade&quot; to mean the last 10 years. When we added up the years since 2005, we found Trump has been registered as a Democrat for 3 years, 9 months, and registered as Republican for 5 years, 6 months (and counting).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Media reports said Trump&rsquo;s switch in December 2011, where he checked &quot;I do not wish to enroll in a party,&quot; &nbsp;made him an independent voter before the 2012 presidential election, in which he considered running himself. His attorney Michael Cohen <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2011/12/trump-switches-voter-registration-to-independent-108587.html\">told Politico that Trump made the change</a> &quot;in order to preserve his right to run as an independent if he is (not pleased) with the GOP nominee.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump decided not to run that year. He switched back to Republican in April 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One last note: Party affiliation in New York matters for who a person can vote for in a primary contest, because New York&nbsp;has <a href=\"http://www.fairvote.org/research-and-analysis/presidential-elections/congressional-and-presidential-primaries-open-closed-semi-closed-and-top-two/\">a closed primary</a>, just like Florida. If someone wants to vote in a primary, they must be registered to that party. But <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2298983-trumpvotinghistory.html\">according to a partial voting record from New York state</a>, Trump hasn&rsquo;t cast a ballot in at least the last two presidential primaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush said Trump &quot;was a Democrat longer in the last decade than he was a Republican.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bush campaign said he meant 2000 to 2010, during which Trump was a Democrat for a bit over nine years. Trump had largely been a Republican in the years prior to that. If that&rsquo;s what Bush meant, he phrased his statement poorly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we reviewed Trump&rsquo;s voter registration in the 10 years leading up to the present, from 2005 to 2015, we found that he has been a Republican for more than five years. He was a registered Democrat for not quite four years in that time frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-08-24T16:32:13.914341", "ruling_date": "2015-08-24T17:25:18", "ruling_headline": "Bush says Trump was a Democrat longer than a Republican 'in the last decade'", "ruling_headline_slug": "bush-says-trump-was-democrat-longer-republican-las", "ruling_link_text": "It depends on the time frame you use", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, &quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/boahINNLYUo\">Jeb Bush: Trump Doesn&#39;t Have a Conservative Record, He&#39;s Been a Dem for Majority of Past Decade</a>,&quot; Aug. 19, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/jeb-bush-trump-has-no-proven-conservative-record-n412791\">Jeb Bush: Trump Has No &#39;Proven Conservative Record&#39;</a>,&quot; Aug. 19, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/10/25/trump.cnn/index.html?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS\">Trump officially joins Reform Party</a>,&quot; Oct. 25, 1999</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/02/trump_through_the_years_1.html\">Donald Trump vs. Donald Trump: The Difference a Decade Makes</a>,&quot; Feb. 16, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2011/12/trump-switches-voter-registration-to-independent-108587.html\">Trump changes registration to &#39;independent&#39;</a>,&quot; Dec. 23, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CBS News, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-switches-party-affiliation-to-independent/\">Donald Trump switches party affiliation to independent</a>,&quot; Dec. 23, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Daily News</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/president-trump-donald-swapped-party-affiliations-potential-presidential-bid-2009-doc-article-1.136213\">President Trump?
