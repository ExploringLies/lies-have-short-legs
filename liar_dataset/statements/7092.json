Another slide read: &quot;New Jersey businesses earned nearly $150 million from lottery sales last year alone.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnder those slides, the website states, &quot;tell Governor Christie and your state legislators not to gamble with New Jersey&#39;s lottery revenues&quot; and provides a link to sign a petition.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere PolitiFact New Jersey checked whether the lottery handed out more than $900 million to schools in 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe learned that&rsquo;s not quite the case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA good chunk of the $930 million helped fund education in New Jersey, but not all of it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe constitutional amendment voters passed in 1969 that authorized the establishment of the state lottery dictated that its &quot;entire net proceeds&quot; must go toward state institutions and education aid. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state lottery doled out $930 million to such causes in fiscal year 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNearly three-quarters of that money went toward education-related initiatives, according to the state lottery&rsquo;s annual report.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMore than $105 million funded programs in the state education department, including about $53 million for school construction and renovation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe majority of the money -- more than $580 million -- benefited higher education. &nbsp;More than half of that $580 million was dedicated to operating costs for public colleges.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, about a quarter of the the $930 million paid for other social services.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRoughly $156 million helped fund state psychiatric hospitals and centers for the developmentally disabled received nearly $47 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMore than $36 million in lottery proceeds bulked up operating support for homes for disabled soldiers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo education-related initiatives received a large majority, but not all, of the $930 million in contributions from the lottery in 2011. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeth Hahn, the New Jersey legislative and political director for Communications Workers of America, acknowledged the error on Wednesday afternoon. The website was updated that evening. It now reads: &quot;In 2011, our public lottery funded classrooms &amp; other services by over $930 million.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, Hahn said that didn&rsquo;t change the fundamental issue that the proposal is bad for businesses and taxpayers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe history of privatization in New Jersey is a &quot;story of graft, fraud and cronyism leading to taxpayers being on the hook for political indiscretion,&quot; he said. &quot;We believe that when it comes to funding education, care for the developmentally disabled, and services for our veterans, New Jerseyans deserve better.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBill Quinn, a spokesman for the state Treasury Department, said the implication that the state is selling the lottery is false. He said a state agency &quot;will still have an oversight function&quot; and &quot;the state is going to continue to get the money from the lottery.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBig Gamble NJ -- an advocacy group that opposes privatizing management of the state lottery -- said on its website that &nbsp;&quot;in 2011, our state-run lottery funded New Jersey classrooms by over $930 million.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe lottery funneled $930 million into education and other social services in fiscal year 2011. Nearly three quarters of that amount funded education-related initiatives.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo New Jersey&rsquo;s classroom didn&rsquo;t receive the full $930 million from the state lottery, but education aid comprised a significant majority of that money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate this statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/11/new_jersey_lottery.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-11-15T16:00:47.170718", "ruling_date": "2012-11-19T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Group claims New Jersey\u2019s classrooms received $930 million from the state\u2019s lottery", "ruling_headline_slug": "group-claims-new-jerseys-classrooms-received-930-m", "ruling_link_text": "Most, but not all, for education", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBig Gamble NJ, <a href=\"http://www.biggamblenj.com/slides/education/\">Education</a>, accessed Nov. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail and phone interviews with Judith Drucker, public relations manager for the <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/lottery/home.shtml\">New Jersey Lottery</a>, Nov. 13-15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Seth Hahn, New Jersey Legislative and Political Director for <a href=\"http://www.cwa-union.org/\">Communications Workers of America</a>, Nov. 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Lottery, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/lottery/where/revenue_recipients/revenue_recipients_fy2011.pdf\">Revenue Recipients: Fiscal Year 2011</a>, accessed Nov. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Lottery, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/lottery/where/annual_reports/annual_report_fy2011.pdf\">Annual Report: 2011</a>, accessed Nov. 14, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Lottery, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/lottery/news/in_news_fy12_record_sales.htm\">New Jersey Lottery Contributes More Than $950 Million to State Education and Institutions with Record Breaking Sales in Fiscal Year 2012</a>, Aug. 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey Treasury Department: Division of State Lottery, <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/lottery/where/audit_reports/FY%202011%20Annual%20Audit%20Report.pdf\">Financial Statements and Supplementary Information for June 30, 2011 and 2010</a>, accessed Nov. 13, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Philadelphia Inquirer, <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2012-04-29/news/31475041_1_privatization-state-parks-christie\">New Jersey joins a list of states considering privatizing their lotteries</a>, April 29, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Star-Ledger, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/08/payout_or_gamble_christie_plan.html\">Payout or gamble?
