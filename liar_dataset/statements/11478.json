As expected, Clinton&rsquo;s use of a private email account and server was a topic of discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At one point, Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., pressed Clinton on whether she had told State Department officials about emails on her private server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Westmoreland:</strong> If they were gathering emails, you had to tell them that you had a private server when you were there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><strong>Clinton:</strong> Well, the -- the server is not the point, it&#39;s the account. And I made it a practice to send emails that were work-related to people on their government accounts. In fact, you know, Secretary Kerry is the first secretary of state to rely primarily on a government account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/08/charles-schumer/fact-checking-chuck-schumers-defense-hillary-clint/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>not the first time</u></a> that Clinton, her staff or her supporters have talked about how other secretaries of state have used email. Of course, the historical comparison can&rsquo;t go back very far because the country hasn&rsquo;t had many secretaries since the advent of email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, beyond Clinton herself -- and Kerry, who has to abide by a requirement to use departmental email -- we only have three secretaries of state to consider. They are Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of those, Powell is the only one who used email very much at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/clinton-backers-defend-email\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>According to MSNBC</u></a>, an aide for Albright said she &quot;did not use email while she was in office&quot; from 1997 to 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, Rice, head of the State Department from 2005 to 2009, was not a habitual emailer either, according to multiple reports. As Harf noted in <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2015/03/238132.htm#DEPARTMENT\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a State Department briefing</u></a>, &quot;Secretary Rice has repeatedly said that she did not regularly use email,&quot; and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonkarl/status/572805555686797312\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a spokesperson for Rice told ABC</u></a>, &quot;She did not use personal email for official communication as secretary.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Powell, on the other hand, took it as his personal mission to get the entire department on email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I arrived at the State Department as secretary with a disastrous information system there,&quot; Powell said on NBC&rsquo;s <em>Meet the Press</em> <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-transcript-september-6-2015-n422606\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>on Sept. 6, 2015</u></a>. &quot;And I had to fix it. And so what I had to do is bring the State Department to the 21st century.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/It-Worked-Me-Life-Leadership/dp/0062135139\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>It Worked for Me</u></a></em>, Powell tells how he got Congress to pay for 44,000 new computers and put an Internet-connected machine on every desk in every embassy and every office in the department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;To complement the official State Department computer in my office, I installed a laptop computer on a private line,&quot; Powell wrote. &quot;My personal email account on the laptop allowed me direct access to anyone online. I started shooting emails to my principal assistants, to individual ambassadors, and increasingly to my foreign-minister colleagues who like me were trying to bring their ministries in the 186,000 miles per second world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An aide to Powell confirmed his use of this personal email account in a statement to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/colin-powell-personal-email-secretary-of-state-115707\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Politico</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He sent emails to his staff generally via their State Department email addresses,&quot; the statement said. &quot;These emails should be on the State Department computers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Powell was on email, but it was through a private, not government email account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said Kerry was the first secretary to rely mainly on a government email account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This statement is accurate, but it glosses over a bit of context -- that only one secretary before Clinton herself, Colin Powell, used email much at all while secretary of state. This undercuts the implication of Clinton&rsquo;s claim, that there was a tradition of sorts of secretaries of state using private email accounts. It was a tradition of one. We rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-23T16:29:44.934100", "ruling_date": "2015-10-23T17:12:47", "ruling_headline": "Clinton says John Kerry was the first secretary of state to rely on a government email account", "ruling_headline_slug": "clinton-says-john-kerry-was-first-secretary-state-", "ruling_link_text": "Sure, but email's got a short history at State", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>House Select Committee on Benghazi, <a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/congressionaltranscripts-4777322?14\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>House Select Committee hearing on Benghazi</u></a>, Oct. 22, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/08/charles-schumer/fact-checking-chuck-schumers-defense-hillary-clint/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Fact-checking Chuck Schumer&#39;s defense of Hillary Clinton&#39;s private email</u></a>, March 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colin Powell, <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/It-Worked-Me-Life-Leadership/dp/0062135139\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>It Worked for Me</u></a></em>, May 22, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC News, <em><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-transcript-september-6-2015-n422606\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Meet the Press</u></a></em>, Sept. 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/colin-powell-personal-email-secretary-of-state-115707\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Colin Powell relied on personal emails while secretary of state</u></a>, March 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hill, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/252863-colin-powell-i-used-two-computers-at-state\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Colin Powell: I used two computers at State</u></a>, Sept. 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABC News, <em><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-secretary-state-colin-powell/story?id=29463658\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>This Week with George Stephanopoulos</u></a></em>, March 8, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MSNBC, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/clinton-backers-defend-email\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Clinton backers: She did nothing out of the ordinary with email</u></a>,&quot; March 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. State Department, <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2015/03/238132.htm#DEPARTMENT\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Daily Briefing</u></a>, March 3, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says John Kerry &quot;is the first secretary of state to rely primarily on a government account.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "statement_context": "a House hearing on Benghazi", "statement_date": "2015-10-22", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 27, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/27/", "subject": "Foreign Policy", "subject_slug": "foreign-policy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 115, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/115/", "subject": "Technology", "subject_slug": "technology", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
