The detail about the lip-reading instructor at the River School was added recently, presumably to give the email more credibility.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that credibility crumbled when we spoke with Nancy Mellon, director of the River School. She described it as a Washington school that serves a wide range of children from 18 months to third grade. It is known for its strong program for hearing-impaired children, but they account for just 15 percent of the students.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMore importantly, the River School doesn&#39;t teach lip-reading, Mellon said, and no one from the faculty has provided any interpretation of the video.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s definitely not us,&quot; she said. &quot;We would never try to do anything like this.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe school has gotten so many inquiries about the chain email that last week it posted this message on its website:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Please be advised that The River School was not involved in any translation services for a recent video clip currently circulating on the Internet.</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo what did she really say? The consensus on All Deaf, a website for people who are hearing impaired, was that <a href=\"http://www.alldeaf.com/sign-language-oralism/94601-anyone-able-make-out.html\">she said</a>, &quot;It&#39;s amazing how they fold that flag.&quot; (However, one person speculated that she told her husband, &quot;This is the third time this week you left your underwear on the floor... I ain&#39;t your mother.&quot;)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLike many chain emails we&#39;ve checked, this one is so flimsy that it needs to fabricate its credibility.
