Zandi is a well-respected economist, one <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/24/hillary-clinton/clinton-trump-both-say-moodys-economist-others-tea/\">PolitiFact has quoted</a> as an expert in <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/26/ron-johnson/sen-ron-johnson-says-economy-was-not-free-fall-whe/\">previous </a><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/26/tom-nelson/tom-nelson-says-initial-stimulus-allocation-create/\">fact checks</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, both Clinton and Trump claim Zandi is <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/24/hillary-clinton/clinton-trump-both-say-moodys-economist-others-tea/\">on the other team</a>. Perhaps that&rsquo;s because politicians and economists on <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/mark-zandi-the-go-to-economist-when-fiscal-war-breaks-out/article/2550939\">both sides of the aisle</a> like Zandi, and because he has contributed to Democrats (including Clinton) and Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zandi <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/24/hillary-clinton/clinton-trump-both-say-moodys-economist-others-tea/\">has said</a> he is a registered Democrat, but he told us the only time he officially worked for a candidate was when he was an economic adviser to U.S. Sen. John McCain during the Arizona Republican&rsquo;s 2008 presidential campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zandi&rsquo;s two analyses project how Clinton&rsquo;s and Trump&rsquo;s policies would affect jobs nationwide during a first term: A gain of 10.4 million jobs under Clinton, a loss of nearly 3.5 million jobs under Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The estimates gained headlines from the <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/07/29/hillary-clintons-policies-would-boost-growth-and-budget-deficits-new-analysis-says/\">Wall Street Journal</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/22/business/economy/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-moodys-report.html?_r=0\">New York Times</a> and <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/21/news/economy/donald-trump-economy-jobs/\">CNN/Money</a>. Critics said, among other things, that Zandi underestimates the value of tax cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, back to the claim about Wisconsin jobs. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s campaign told us it arrived at the Wisconsin figures cited in the tweet by distributing Zandi&rsquo;s estimated total gains and losses among states in proportion to their population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One can&rsquo;t assume that Clinton&rsquo;s or Trump&rsquo;s policies would have such an evenly-distributed impact on each state; indeed, for years, Wisconsin&rsquo;s job growth has <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/business/state-continues-to-lag-behind-nation-in-job-creation-b99740492z1-382236891.html\">lagged the nation&rsquo;s</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Zandi and economist <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/staff/alan-cole\">Alan Cole</a>&nbsp;of the free market-oriented <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/tax-foundation/\">Tax Foundation</a>, which PolitiFact also quotes often, told us the extrapolation is reasonable. Zandi added that if he did a state-by-state breakdown, he would expect the numbers for Wisconsin to be roughly what Clinton stated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To counter Clinton&rsquo;s claim, Trump&rsquo;s campaign pointed us to the Tax Foundation&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-hillary-clinton-s-tax-proposals\">January 2016 analysis</a> of Clinton&rsquo;s tax plans, which projects that nationally there would be 311,000 fewer jobs over 10 years than would be expected under current law. Meanwhile, the foundation in a <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-s-tax-plan\">September 2015 analysis</a> of Trump&rsquo;s tax plans projected 5.3 million more jobs over the same period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cole agreed with Zandi that Zandi&rsquo;s analyses considered more factors -- for example, spending as well as taxes -- than the Tax Foundation did. Cox also called Zandi&rsquo;s analyses an honest and serious effort, but said the Tax Foundation arrived at different conclusions because it took a different approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that both candidates have announced new proposals since the various estimates were made, though Zandi said he doesn&rsquo;t believe they would change his estimates significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton says she &quot;would bring 186,740 new jobs to Wisconsin&quot; and &quot;Donald Trump would cost Wisconsin 61,050 jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numbers are derived from analyses of Clinton and Trump policy proposals done by a respected economist from Moody Analytics who has supported both Democrats and Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the numbers are estimates, not certainties.
