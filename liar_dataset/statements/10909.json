Patricia Morgan of late has repeatedly criticized the state&rsquo;s financial support for the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority, asserting that the entity has cost taxpayers more than $450 million, even though it was never supposed to cost them a dime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Last week, the West Warwick Republican, who represents a group calling itself the Republican Policy Group, convened a press conference and unveiled an investigative report on the subsidies, which totaled more than $30 million last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">This included $23 million for debt service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">&quot;Seriously,&quot; Morgan said, &quot;it was sold as a building that would never cost taxpayers a dime and it continues to cost us money.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Year after year, state budgets show, in addition to paying off the convention center&rsquo;s debt -- its mortgage, so to speak -- the taxpayers have kicked in subsidies to keep the authority afloat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Since 1994, the state has allocated in excess of $450 million to the authority, which runs the Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts Center and Veterans Memorial Auditorium in addition to the convention center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">That&rsquo;s a big number and it made us wonder: Did someone really say this facility would never cost taxpayers a dime? If so, what were they talking about?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">So we asked Morgan for her sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">We also searched through The Journal&rsquo;s archives and found someone who had made just such a statement -- Richard M. Oster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Oster, the heir of a family metals enterprise, had risen to the loftiest heights of the business world, serving as the chairman of the London-based Cookson Group PLC, a multinational company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">In 1987, then-Gov. Edward DiPrete installed Oster as chairman of the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">This made him the front man in 1989 for the campaign to sell the public on the need for a convention center, which was expected to cost $225 million. It was to be one of the largest economic development projects in Rhode Island&rsquo;s history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Oster told The Journal such a facility would bring 500,000 visitors a year to the city, pump $60 million to $100 million per year into the economy and generate enough new tax revenue -- via hotel, income, sales and property taxes -- to offset the deficit from construction and operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">&quot;This won&rsquo;t cost the taxpayers one dime,&quot; Oster said in 1989. That was his clincher, the line he used after detailing a list of economic benefits. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Morgan told us this was the quote she had in mind in her attack on the convention center&rsquo;s finances. Morgan, however, did not talk about how Oster and the other proponents claimed that new tax revenue would make up for the taxpayers&rsquo; costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Morgan&rsquo;s repeated emphasis on costs without discussing new tax revenues drew criticism from Joseph R. Paolino Jr., the former mayor and another champion of the convention center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">&quot;I think she&rsquo;s wrong,&quot; Paolino said. &quot;I don&rsquo;t think she truly understands the concept of the convention center and what a convention center is supposed to do for a community.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Paolino, who refers to the late Oster as &quot;one of the leading business giants of our community,&quot; says any analysis of convention center appropriations must consider tax revenue generated by convention center activity. This is the &quot;real story,&quot; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">He acknowledged that he doesn&rsquo;t know how Oster&rsquo;s projections worked out. But last week the Authority said its experts calculate that the convention center, the Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts Center and Veterans Memorial Auditorium have an average annual impact totaling $135 million and generate $10 million in state and local tax revenue across about 500 events &mdash; hockey games, conferences and musical performances among them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">That&rsquo;s the opposing point of view. Is it credible? &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">We turned to Gary Sasse, who headed up the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council in the 1980s and is now director of the Hassenfeld Institute for Public Leadership at Bryant University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Sasse, who supported the project in 1989, says he believes the presence of the convention center has had some degree of multiplier effect on the local economy -- possibly enough to offset costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">But Sasse emphasizes that the actual numbers are important for this debate and there is no independent entity around to do the hard work of providing a trustworthy assessment. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">&quot;Who is the independent scorekeeper?&quot; he asks. &quot;That&rsquo;s the problem.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\"><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">Morgan had her numbers right. And Richard Oster did famously tell the public that the center wasn&rsquo;t going to cost the taxpayers a dime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">But she failed to put Oster&rsquo;s claim in context. Oster didn&rsquo;t say convention center revenues would pay its bills. He was talking about the center&rsquo;s overall economic impact. And, as Gary Sasse says, without an independent scorekeeper, we won&rsquo;t know whether the center&rsquo;s impact offsets its costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:10pt;\">As a result, we rate her statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Mostly True</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">PolitiFact Rhode Island</a> to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
