The attacks have already started, with Crist firing a shot about Scott&rsquo;s budget actions over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a page titled &quot;<a href=\"http://www.charliecrist.com/scottfreeflorida/top-5-reasons-make-florida-scott-free\"><u>Top 5 reasons to make Florida Scott-free</u></a>,&quot; Crist brings up education spending as No. 1. &quot;Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion,&quot; the site says. &quot;To put that into perspective, $3.3 billion could pay the yearly salaries of more than 70,000 teachers in Florida.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering Scott came into office during the Great Recession, his budget cutting is well known. We thought we&rsquo;d dive into the numbers to see whether he proposed that<strong> </strong>the state&rsquo;s schools take a $3.3 billion hit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slash and learn</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott entered office in 2011, facing a $3.6 billion shortfall in the state&rsquo;s $70.5 billion budget. His solution in February 2011 was to propose cutting $4.6 billion in spending and $2.4 billion in state revenue by reducing taxes, regulations and fees. His budget came in at $65.9 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His proposal, encompassing two fiscal years, recommended cutting per-pupil spending by about $700, a 10 percent reduction from the state&rsquo;s current $6,899 spending per student at the time. Part of the cuts included a 10 percent cut in the required local effort portion of property taxes and a loss of more than $870 million in federal stimulus money. In all, that added up to a projected $4.8 billion in cuts to education over the two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scott plan attempted to offset some of those cuts with other federal aid and by requiring teachers to contribute 5 percent to their pension plans, adding back about $400 per student. We&rsquo;ve broken down <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/nov/11/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-rick-scott-cut-k-12-13-billion-/\"><u>some of those dollar figures before</u></a>. In all, funding would have been cut some $3.3 billion the first year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legislators did not respond well to such a drastic proposed budget reduction for schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Are we looking at the cuts the governor is making? The answer is no, a resounding no,&quot; PreK-12 Education Appropriations subcommittee chairman Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, told the <em>Gainesville Sun.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a contentious session, the Legislature passed and Scott signed a budget that included $1.3 billion in cuts to education, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/816261-fefp-funding-history.html\"><u>from $18.2 billion to $16.5 billion</u></a>. The reduction ended up being about $540 per student, a 7.9 percent cut in funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following year, Scott requested a $1 billion increase in education dollars, which was included in the 2012-2013 state budget. The increase was needed to make up for more than 30,000 new students and a decline in property taxes from a 3 percent drop in property values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He then requested $1.2 billion more in 2013; the Legislature agreed to $1 billion. This year he has asked Tallahassee for $542 million more for next year, bringing the totals to $10.6 billion in state cash and $18.8 billion overall. This would be <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2014/jan/29/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-his-k-12-education-budget-proposal/\"><u>a record amount of spending</u></a> in terms of dollars, but still less than the amount being spent per student when he took office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crist said &quot;Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion,&quot; pointing to a budget proposal from 2011, Scott&rsquo;s first year in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott did propose cutting $3.3 billion from the education budget, alienating members of his own party in the Legislature in the process. He even had suggested cutting $4.8 billion over two years. Part of the cuts were from the loss of federal stimulus dollars, but the state had the power to restore them had it chosen to.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, Tallahassee approved $1.3 billion in cuts. Scott has asked for increases in the three years since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crist&rsquo;s statement was specifically phrased, saying Scott &quot;tried&quot; to reduce school funding. That is accurate, but it&rsquo;s important to note that Scott&#39;s initial proposal died in the Legislature, and funding has increased since that attempt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-03-27T14:47:01.372332", "ruling_date": "2014-03-27T16:06:13", "ruling_headline": "Charlie Crist says 'Rick Scott tried to slash school funding by $3.3 billion'", "ruling_headline_slug": "charlie-crist-says-rick-scott-tried-slash-school-f", "ruling_link_text": "He proposed cuts, then increases later", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CharlieCrist.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.charliecrist.com/scottfreeflorida/top-5-reasons-make-florida-scott-free\"><u>Top 5 reasons to make Florida Scott-free</u></a>,&quot; March 25, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/gubernatorial/gov-rick-scott-unveils-budget-of-deep-cuts-to-spending-taxes/1150127\"><u>Gov.
