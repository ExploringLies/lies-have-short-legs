Rick Perry said fellow Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has changed positions on pivotal topics, including abortion rights.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;You go back through my record for 20-plus years, I have been a consistent conservative,&quot; Perry <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/2011/10/30/gov-rick-perry-rebooting-his-presidential-campaign/print\">told Chris </a><a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/2011/10/30/gov-rick-perry-rebooting-his-presidential-campaign/print\">Wallace</a> on Oct. 30, 2011. Perry said he has &quot;always been pro-life,&quot; while Romney has &quot;been on both sides&quot; of that issue.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;He&rsquo;s been ... pro-abortion,&quot; Perry said.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPerry has lobbed flip-flop charges at Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, since soon after entering the presidential race. During a Sept. 22 Republican presidential debate, Perry, in a halting verbal attack, hit that idea hard, saying that Romney previously had stood up for Roe v. Wade &quot;before he was against&quot; it. Perry was referring to the 1973 landmark Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before a fetus is viable, the time at which it can survive outside a woman&#39;s body.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, has Romney flip-flopped on abortion rights?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor another <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/02/jon-huntsman/Says-Mitt-Romney-flip-flopped-on-abortion/\">fact-check</a>, PolitiFact National looked into that question.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRomney made several statements about abortion rights earlier in his political career. Here are two of his clearest statements about his position:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull; &nbsp;In a debate during his unsuccessful 1994 challenge to U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., Romney said, &quot;I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country.&quot; He added: &quot;I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&bull; &nbsp;In his successful 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, &quot;I will preserve and protect a woman&#39;s right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThose comments &mdash; made in public forums eight years apart &mdash; struck us as solid evidence that Romney was then an abortion-rights supporter.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat about his views today?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe &quot;issues&quot; portion of his website doesn&rsquo;t have a section on abortion, but Romney wrote an <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/269984/my-pro-life-pledge-mitt-romney\">op-ed</a> that was posted on the National Review&rsquo;s website June 18, 2011, presenting his abortion views. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. The <a href=\"http://www.sba-list.org/newsroom/press-releases/romney-refusal-sign-pro-life-pledge-leaves-more-questions-answers\">pledge</a> includes a promise that if the signer becomes president, he will appoint &quot;pro-life&quot; candidates to head certain federal agencies such as the Justice Department and to advance legislation cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood clinics and other abortion providers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the op-ed, Romney wrote: &quot;I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRomney goes on to say that if he is elected president, he will push for a law &quot;to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion&quot; and &quot;appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRomney&rsquo;s views on abortion rights today are clearly different from what he expressed in 1994 and 2002. Most significantly, Romney earlier voiced support for the Roe decision; now, he says it should be reversed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate Perry&rsquo;s claim that Romney flip-flopped on abortion rights True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-04T18:31:26.250919", "ruling_date": "2011-11-05T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Rick Perry says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion rights", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-perry-says-mitt-romney-flip-flopped-abortion-", "ruling_link_text": "Supported Roe before; now he wants it reversed", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tFox News Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/2011/10/30/gov-rick-perry-rebooting-his-presidential-campaign/print\">transcript</a>, Oct. 30, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFox News, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/09/22/fox-news-google-gop-2012-presidential-debate/\">transcript</a>, Fox News-Google Republican presidential debate, Sept. 22, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact National, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/02/jon-huntsman/Says-Mitt-Romney-flip-flopped-on-abortion/\">Jon Huntsman accuses Mitt Romney of flip-flopping on abortion</a>,&quot; Nov. 2, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSusan B.
