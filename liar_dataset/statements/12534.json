We are putting his statements on PolitiFact&rsquo;s Flip-O-Meter which measures the extent to which a politician flips without making a judgment call about those changes. (You can read all of our fact-checks of Rubio on our <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/marco-rubio/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Truth-O-Meter</u></a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While campaigning, Rubio repeatedly said he was running for president and not for re-election. After he dropped out in March, he said he would not seek re-election. But in recent weeks some of his comments left wiggle room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rubio&rsquo;s statements while a presidential candidate</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leading up to his April 13, 2015, president announcement, Rubio repeatedly said he wouldn&rsquo;t seek another Senate term if he ran for president. He couldn&rsquo;t be on the ballot in Florida for two federal offices at the same time, although technically there was time to do that if he ran for president and dropped out because the qualifying period for the Senate seat is June 2016. Rubio&rsquo;s vow to not run cleared the path for a handful of <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2016/may/27/fact-checking-us-senate-candidates-florida/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>other Republicans</u></a> to jump into the race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said many times he had no intention for conducting a bid for Senate.

And I&#39;m not going to have an exit strategy premised on the idea that I&#39;m going to pivot back to a Senate race. We have quality candidates in the state on the Republican side who could run and make great senators.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/05/sen-marco-rubio-yes-im-ready-to-be-president/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>May 11, 2015: </u></a>Rubio told ABC News, &quot;I believe that if you want to be president of the United States, you run for president.

And that&rsquo;s the power given to it in the Constitution to act as a check and balance on the excess of the president. It&rsquo;s even more important given the fact that control of the Senate could very well come down to what happens in the Florida race.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said multiple times in 2015 and 2016 that he would not seek another term in the Senate, even if he dropped out of the presidential race.
