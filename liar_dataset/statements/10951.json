In his June 16 announcement speech, Trump said he also has a new competitor in the hotel biz: a group of entrepreneurial terrorists who call themselves the Islamic State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#39;ve become rich. I&#39;m in competition with them. They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We weren&rsquo;t sure if we could, in fact, believe Trump&rsquo;s claim that the Islamic State built a hotel in Syria, so we decided to check it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The grain of truth here is that the Islamic State has taken over a luxury hotel. But they didn&rsquo;t build it. And it&rsquo;s not in Syria. And it doesn&rsquo;t really operate like a normal hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find any evidence that the Islamic State is running any sort of hotel in Syria. We tried to get in touch with a Trump spokesperson and didn&rsquo;t hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevoiraq/status/594262905408724992\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">this May</a>, the Islamic State reopened a five-star hotel in Mosul that shut down when the terrorist group took over the city, one of the largest in Iraq. (Most of the information about this has come from <a href=\"http://elaph.com/Web/News/2015/5/1005079.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Arabic language news sources</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the Islamic State didn&rsquo;t build the Ninawa International Hotel; they just occupied it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, it&rsquo;s not really open for business. According to news reports, the Islamic State is using the hotel&rsquo;s 262 rooms to house the group&rsquo;s commanding officers, and they might use it as a wedding venue for the group&rsquo;s members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can&rsquo;t book a room at Ninawa online, and the <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g303963-Mosul_Ninawa_Province-Hotels.html#REVIEWS\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">TripAdvisor page</a> is now defunct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But pre-Islamic State reviews -- caught by <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/hayesbrown/you-probably-dont-want-to-stay-in-isiss-5-star-hotel#.crnD3x0JN\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Buzzfeed</a> and others -- said the hotel had a good view of the Tigris river, a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pool and two restaurants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News reports say that, keeping with Islamic law, the Islamic State banned drinking and smoking in the hotel, and workers have removed decorations they disapprove of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump claimed the Islamic State &quot;just built a hotel in Syria.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Islamic State does occupy a luxury hotel, which they took over about a month and a half ago. However, it&rsquo;s in Iraq, not Syria, and they didn&rsquo;t build it. It&rsquo;s an old hotel that the group refurbished and occupied. As far as we know, the hotel&rsquo;s rooms are reserved for Islamic State commanders, and the event spaces are for weddings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least for now, Trump doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about the Islamic State running him out of the hotel business. We rate his claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-06-16T15:45:07.579232", "ruling_date": "2015-06-16T16:10:22", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump: ISIS built a hotel in Syria", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-isis-built-hotel-syria", "ruling_link_text": "Trump's worried about competition", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Buzzfeed, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/hayesbrown/you-probably-dont-want-to-stay-in-isiss-5-star-hotel#.hqO0okBE8\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">You Probably Don&rsquo;t Want To Stay In ISIS&rsquo;s Five-Star Hotel,</a>&quot; May 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RT, &quot;<a href=\"http://rt.com/news/256001-isis-luxury-hotel-mosul/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">5-star resort opens for ISIS supporters in Iraq,</a>&quot; May 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christian Science Monitor, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2015/0506/Why-ISIS-now-has-a-5-star-hotel-for-its-fighters\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Why ISIS now has a 5-star hotel for its fighters,</a>&quot; May 6, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daily Beast, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/06/isis-is-running-a-5-star-hotel-in-iraq.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">ISIS Is Running a 5-Star Hotel in Iraq,</a>&quot; May 6, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>The Islamic State &quot;just built a hotel in Syria.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech announcing his 2016 presidential campaign", "statement_date": "2015-06-16", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 37, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/37/", "subject": "Terrorism", "subject_slug": "terrorism", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
