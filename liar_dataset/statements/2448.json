That was when then-Gov. Kitzhaber was nearing the end of a second term marked by steep job losses and bitter fights with Republicans over state budget cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Under Gov. Kitzhaber,&quot; Dudley said in a recent speech in Albany, &quot;unemployment rose 65 percent, state spending went up 57 percent and personal incomes declined compared to the rest of the country.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered about two things: Was it really that bad? And how much can you blame Kitzhaber for what happened?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo let&rsquo;s take a look, first at the unemployment number.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1995, when Kitzhaber took office, Oregon&rsquo;s economy was streaking at a record pace and unemployment was as low as it had ever been, 4.7 percent. <a href=\"http://www.qualityinfo.org/olmisj/labforce\">The rate hovered around 5 percent&nbsp; </a>for most of his career as governor because the economy remained healthy. But joblessness began to spike upward in his final two years as the national and state economies went into a deep recession. National unemployment figures followed a similar trend, although remained about a percentage point below Oregon&rsquo;s. When Kitzhaber left office, Oregon&rsquo;s unemployment rate stood at 7.8 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Dudley&rsquo;s correct: at the end of Kitzhaber&rsquo;s tenure, the unemployment rate was up 65 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat about that state spending figure? That&rsquo;s a little trickier.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe hot economy in the 1990s produced <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.or.us/comm/lfo/2009-11_budget/2009-11_Budget_Highlights_Update.pdf\">record-setting tax revenues for the state. </a>Total state spending, which includes federal pass-through money, such as Medicaid and food stamp payments, indeed increased by 56 percent over Kitzhaber&rsquo;s eight years, rising from $22.6 billion to $35.3 billion. General fund spending, however, rose by a more staid 26 percent -- from $8.2 billion to $10.3 billion -- and that&rsquo;s widely considered the more accurate measure of state spending fluctuations.&nbsp; (Oregon&#39;s population grew 11 percent between 1995 and 2003. Inflation between those two years was 28 percent.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWorth noting: Republicans controlled the Legislature throughout Kitzhaber&rsquo;s tenure, and approved all general fund spending increases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast, we checked on personal income.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe dot-com boom benefited not just Oregon but the rest of the nation, too. Even though Oregonians were making more money, they weren&rsquo;t keeping up, &nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.oregonbusinessplan.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=gV8oIvBK4aU%3d&amp;tabid=204\">per-capita income rates fell </a>slightly in relation to other states. In 1995, Oregon&rsquo;s per capita income stood at 97 percent of the nation&rsquo;s, when Kitzhaber left office it had dropped to 95 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Dudley&rsquo;s math mostly holds up. But is it accurate to attribute those numbers to Kitzhaber&rsquo;s leadership?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked with state economist Tom Potiowsky, who monitors the ups and downs of Oregon&rsquo;s financial health.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said Oregon&rsquo;s economy, which is based heavily in manufacturing, is at the mercy of national and global economic factors. When home building goes down, Oregon&rsquo;s lumber products aren&rsquo;t needed. When computer sales are down, Oregon&rsquo;s chips go unsold, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Those were very much national economic factors, really pushing us around,&quot; during Kitzhaber&rsquo;s final years, Potiowsky said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUniversity of Oregon economist Tim Duy had a similar take. What happened at the end of Kitzhaber&rsquo;s administration was caused by the national business cycle and was largely out of his control.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYet Oregon didn&rsquo;t help itself much, notes Duy and John Tapogna, president of ECONorthwest, a Portland economic consulting firm. When high-tech firms were expanding, the state -- and Kitzhaber&rsquo;s office -- wasn&rsquo;t exactly helping them navigate the state&rsquo;s strict land use rules.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo is Dudley right to hang Oregon&rsquo;s economic decline around Kitzhaber&rsquo;s neck?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t-- His statement is factually accurate on unemployment, spending growth and the decline in per capita income relative to the rest of the nation during Kitzhaber&rsquo;s term.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t-- &nbsp;Oregon, however, was knocked for a loop by the same dot-com bust that sent the nation&rsquo;s economy into a tailspin. Realistically, there&rsquo;s not much a governor can do about those kind of macroeconomic factors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t-- Oregon enjoyed a robust economy for six of the eight years Kitzhaber was governor. But when things started to go south, Kitzhaber was at the helm.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe find the claim to be Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/09/politifact_oregon_what_about_t.html\">Comment on this item.</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-09-22T20:20:33.487855", "ruling_date": "2010-09-24T11:41:02", "ruling_headline": "Chris Dudley says Oregon\u2019s economy tanked on John Kitzhaber\u2019s watch", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-dudley-says-oregons-economy-tanked-john-kitz", "ruling_link_text": "His numbers are accurate, but was Kitzhaber at fault?", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tOregon Employment Department, <a href=\"http://www.qualityinfo.org/olmisj/labforce\">Local Area Employment Statistics</a>, Sept. 15, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLegislative Fiscal Office, <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.or.us/comm/lfo/2009-11_budget/2009-11_Budget_Highlights_Update.pdf\">Budget Highlights report</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tECONorthwest, <a href=\"http://www.oregonbusinessplan.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=gV8oIvBK4aU%3d&amp;tabid=204\">Oregon Business Plan</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with LeRoy Coleman, spokesman for <a href=\"http://www.chrisdudley.com/\">Chris Dudley</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Jillian Schoene, spokeswoman for <a href=\"http://www.johnkitzhaber.com/\">John Kitzhaber</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with <a href=\"http://www.oregon.gov/DAS/OEA/index.shtml\">state economist </a>Tom Potiowsky<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with John Tapogna, president, <a href=\"http://www.econw.com/\">ECONorthwest</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with economist <a href=\"http://econforum.uoregon.edu/\">Tim Duy, University of Oregon</a><br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Financial adviser", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Oregon", "id": 673, "last_name": "Dudley", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "chris-dudley", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Chris_Dudley.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Oregon", "edition": "Oregon", "edition_slug": "oregon", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 9, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Oregon Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/9/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/673/", "total_count": 3, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.chrisdudley.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Under Gov.
