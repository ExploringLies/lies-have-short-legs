Ted Strickland have failed, and Kasich can do better.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Kasich,&quot; the ad says, &quot;was the architect who balanced the budget, cut spending, created a surplus, igniting record job creation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&#39;s a sweeping claim that begs for explanation and context. The ad doesn&#39;t provide it. Neither does the posting about the ad on the campaign&#39;s blog, though it more helpfully calls Kasich &quot;chief architect of the 1997 Balanced Budget.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Ohio looked into the record for more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe started with &quot;Balanced Budget.&quot; That refers to the federal Balanced Budget Act of 1997, <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:H.R.2015:\">H.R</a>. 2015, a bipartisan agreement to balance the federal budget by the year 2002. The 537-page bill was sponsored by Kasich, a U.S. House member representing a suburban Columbus district from 1983 through 2000 and chairman of the House Budget Committee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe legislation also promised the first major tax cuts in 16 years, and it reduced Medicare and Medicaid payments to health care providers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKasich was widely recognized as the its chief architect and a key player in negotiating its passage. When President Clinton signed the agreement into law, Kasich stood beside him in the Rose Garden.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFailure is an orphan, but success has a thousand fathers -- or custody-seekers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNewt Gingrich, Kasich&#39;s mentor and then-speaker of the House, called him &quot;a historic figure. More than any single man, he is responsible for balancing the budget.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClinton, appearing in Cleveland for Strickland in September, said Kasich &quot;always tells people that he brokered for the Republicans the balanced-budget bill that I signed. That is true but misleading&quot; -- because, Clinton said, Kasich earlier was among congressional Republicans who shut down the government because the president refused to slash federal agencies and programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRegardless, conditions were comparatively favorable for the budget agreement. It came amid a booming economy and increased tax revenues that already had driven down the deficit, ultimately leading to a surplus. (The increase in tax revenues is credited to the improved economy and to tax increases that were part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClinton announced that surplus in September 1998, a year after the agreement was signed. It was the first U.S. budget surplus in 29 years. Federal budgets were balanced in both fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublicans claimed credit, saying they had pressured Clinton to adopt their balanced-budget commitment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tClinton said he and congressional Democrats deserved the credit for passing the 1993 budget bill, which did not win a single Republican vote in the House and which Cinton has said &quot;led to an enormous flowering of the economy in America.&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/19/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-takes-credit-flowering-economy-1990s/\">PolitiFact examined that claim</a> in detail last April and rated it Half True. The economy did improve after the 1993 budget bill became law, but economists say many factors played a role.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnemployment was one key indicator of the economy&#39;s health. It fell from 4.9 percent in 1997 to 3.9 percent in 2000, continuing a steady decrease that started in 1993.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the impressive amount of job creation does not mean that a record number of jobs were added.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy added 3,154,000 jobs in 1998 -- about 100,000 more than were created in 1997 -- and another 3,063,000 in 1999. But neither year reaches the peak of 3,447,000 jobs in 1994. (Job creation began to slow in 2000.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKasich deserves credit for conceiving, sponsoring and negotiating passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the ad overstates his role by saying he balanced the budget. And it exaggerates by giving Kasich, or the the budget agreement, credit for a surplus or &quot;record&quot; job creation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Kasich&rsquo;s statement as Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-31T12:48:19.964348", "ruling_date": "2010-10-31T15:00:00", "ruling_headline": "John Kasich touts role in balancing budget, creating surplus, boosting jobs", "ruling_headline_slug": "john-kasich-touts-role-balancing-budget-creating-s", "ruling_link_text": "A guy named Clinton, and others, had a role in it, too", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tJohn Kasich 2010, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LKqrrVLcvs\">Busted</a>,&quot; posted to YouTube Oct. 14, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t105th Congress, <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:H.R.2015:\">H.R</a>. 2015, Library of Congress Bill Summary &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPBS NewsHour, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/congress/july97/budget_7-29.html\">Analyzing the budget deal</a>,&quot; July 29 1997<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlain Dealer, &quot;Kasich sets sights on ultimate prize,&quot; Feb. 22, 1998<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlain Dealer, &quot;Kasich at the crossroads,&quot; June 7, 1998<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tColumbus Dispatch, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.dispatchpolitics.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2010/02/14/copy/kasichbudget.ART_ART_02-14-10_A1_0VGIVRO.html?sid=101\">Kasich big on budget balancing</a>,&quot; Feb. 14, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPlain Dealer, &quot;<a href=\"http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2010/09/bill_clinton_headlines_rally_f.html\">Bill Clinton headlines rally for Gov.
