They&#39;re our brothers.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faith and Freedom Coalition founder Ralph Reed told Raddatz he doesn&rsquo;t support gay couples raising adopted children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;This is about what&#39;s best for children here in the United States. And the social science is irrefutable,&quot; Reed said. &quot;And it is that a child who grows up in a home without the mother and father present and they both play very unique procreative, nurturing and socializing role, they&#39;re nine times more likely to end up dropping out of high school. They&#39;re five times more likely to end up in poverty. And they&#39;re three times more likely to end up addicted to drugs and alcohol.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PunditFact wanted to know what social science has to say about the effects gay parents have on children compared to straight parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The social science statistics Reed called &quot;irrefutable&quot; actually have nothing to do with gay couples raising kids. Instead, they&rsquo;re focused on the effects of children who grow up without a father in a one-parent household. Put another way, the studies focus on the quantity of parents and not their&nbsp;gender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reed&rsquo;s office pointed us to <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=gJvQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=awakening+ralph+reed&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YqtWU9_6N9TIsATW0IGQAw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gay&amp;f=false\"><u>his book</u></a>, as well as a <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/research/testimony/2012/06/05-poverty-families-haskins\"><u>Brookings Institution report</u></a> that says parents who graduate from high school and bear children within marriage have a 2 percent chance of living in poverty. But neither the study nor his book draws any comparison between gay and straight marriages. In fact, it makes no mention of gay marriages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other research often cited by gay parenting critics, like Sara McLanahan&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=kLUX8BJ1exUC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s\"><u>Growing Up With a Single Parent</u></a></em>, similarly doesn&rsquo;t include any information on gay parenting, specifically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, the critique is focused on having one parent present versus two. We decided not to investigate further the specific stats Reed cited once we realized they weren&rsquo;t measuring what he said they were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comparisons like Reed&rsquo;s are &quot;a complete misuse of the research,&quot; said Judith Stacey, a New York University sociologist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did find<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.markregnerus.com/uploads/4/0/6/5/4065759/regnerus_july_2012_ssr.pdf\"><u>one study</u></a> funded by conservative organizations as showing gay parents are worse than straight ones, but it&rsquo;s been denounced by the <a href=\"http://www.asanet.org/documents/ASA/pdfs/12-144_307_Amicus_%20%28C_%20Gottlieb%29_ASA_Same-Sex_Marriage.pdf\"><u>American Sociological Association</u></a>, the researcher&rsquo;s own <a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/sociology/news/7572\"><u>university</u></a> and many <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/health/study-examines-effect-of-having-a-gay-parent.html?_r=0\"><u>reputable sociologists</u></a>.

What&rsquo;s more important is the number of parents a child has, experts told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Kids are better off with two parents,&quot; said Andrew Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University. &quot;But we don&#39;t have much evidence that those parents must be of the opposite gender.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reed said there&rsquo;s &quot;irrefutable&quot; social science to show that children are better off being parented by a mother and father. That&rsquo;s not right. What studies really show is that children are better off with two parents. Those studies do not focus on gender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All reputable research so far indicates that children brought up by gay parents are just well off as those brought up by straight parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Reed&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-04-22T14:48:30.950729", "ruling_date": "2014-04-22T15:45:07", "ruling_headline": "Ralph Reed says 'irrefutable' social science shows kids better off raised by straight couples", "ruling_headline_slug": "ralph-reed-says-irrefutable-social-science-shows-k", "ruling_link_text": "Research shows gay, straight parents equally nurturing", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>American Sociological Review</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.asanet.org/images/members/docs/pdf/featured/stacey.pdf\"><u>(How) does the sexual orientation of parents matter?</u></a>&quot; April 2001</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Institute of Family Studies, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.aifs.gov.au/cfca/pubs/papers/a145197/index.html\"><u>Same-sex parented families in Australia</u></a>,&quot; Jan. 2, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brookings Institution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/research/testimony/2012/06/05-poverty-families-haskins\"><u>Combating poverty: understanding new challenges for families</u></a>,&quot; June 5, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Current Directions in Psychological Science</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://people.virginia.edu/~cjp/articles/p06.pdf\"><u>Children of lesbian and gay parents</u></a>,&quot; 2006</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Joy Creaseman, Faith and Freedom Coalition marketing director, April 22, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Journal of Marriage and Family</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.squareonemd.com/pdf/Does%20the%20Gender%20of%20Parents%20Matter%202010.pdf\"><u>How does the gender of parents matter?</u></a>&quot; February 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Andrew Cherlin, Johns Hopkins University sociology professor, April 21, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/health/study-examines-effect-of-having-a-gay-parent.html?_r=0\"><u>Debate on a study examining gay parents</u></a>,&quot; June 11, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Pediatrics</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/18/peds.2013-0377.full.pdf+html\"><u>Promoting the well-being of children whose parents are gay or lesbian</u></a>,&quot; March 20, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview with Judith Stacey, New York University sociology professor, April 21, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Social Science Research</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.markregnerus.com/uploads/4/0/6/5/4065759/regnerus_july_2012_ssr.pdf\"><u>How different are the adult children of parents who have same-sex relationships?
