The author, Brookings vice president Darrell West, called for immigration reform that in the short term would allow employers to hire workers with scientific and technological skills.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tWest&rsquo;s number drew from a group known as <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/lpr_fr_2011.pdf\">legal permanent residents</a>, commonly referred to as green card holders. In 2011, about one million people became legal permanent residents, according to the federal government&rsquo;s yearbook of immigration statistics. Those who entered based on family ties accounted for about <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R42866.pdf\">65 percent</a>.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tThat <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2011/ois_yb_2011.pdf\">included</a> about 235,000 who were family-sponsored preferences and about 453,000 who were immediate relatives of U.S. citizens.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tImmediate relatives include spouses, children under the age of 21 or parents of U.S. citizens. If approved, the U.S. government immediately grants those visas for relatives, and there isn&rsquo;t a quota.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tFamily sponsored immigrants includes spouses and children of legal permanent residents as well as other relatives of citizens such as siblings.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tThe U.S. government grants up to <a href=\"http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextchannel=aa290a5659083210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextoid=aa290a5659083210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD\">226,000</a> family sponsored visas per year, and 140,000 employment-based visas per year.

That&rsquo;s because the quota refers to the number of visas -- valid for six months -- issued in a year, while the immigration statistics yearbook number refers to the actual admissions. So someone can be issued a visa in 2010 but may not travel until 2011.)</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tThere are a few important exceptions within the different categories, though. Jeffrey Passel, at Pew Research Hispanic Center, said in an email that most immigrants come for work even if they came here under a family or relative category. And not all of the employment-visas are for workers, since the &quot;employment-based&quot; category also includes visas for spouses and children of the workers.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tThe current debate about overhauling the U.S. immigration system <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/03/18/immigration-hearing-pits-family-against-economy/\">pits </a>those who want to protect family reunification against those who say our economy would benefit from a heavier focus on letting in immigrants based on needed job skills.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;\">\r\n\tIn his book, Bush argues the focus on family reunification leads to &quot;crowding out most others, including immigrants who would contribute greatly to economic growth.&quot;
