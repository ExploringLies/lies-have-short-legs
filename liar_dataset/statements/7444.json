Bill Nelson spoke with a Central Florida news station to help explain the issue &mdash; and now viewers question his accuracy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnchor Ybeth Bruzual had asked Nelson, a Democrat, about mandatory budget cuts set to go into effect March 1: &quot;How did we get to this point?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s what <a href=\"http://www.cfnews13.com/content/news/cfnews13/video.html?clip=http://static.cfnews13.com/newsvideo/cfn/InDepthNelson0221.flv&amp;vtitle=In%20Depth%20with%20Sen.%20Bill%20Nelson%3A%20Will%20sequestration%20happen%3F\">he told viewers</a> of Central Florida News 13, a partner of PolitiFact Florida:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Well, a year and a half ago, when the country, in order to pay its bills, (and we) had to raise the artificial statutory debt ceiling so the country could pay its bills, a deal was struck: a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately, and then a special committee was set up. They were to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Hanging over their head was a meat cleaver called the sequester, that was going to be, across the board, over a trillion dollars of additional cuts, but without a scalpel &mdash; a meat cleaver. Nobody ever expected the sequester to go into effect. It was never supposed to. It was the onerous alternative that would force the super-committee to come to agreement.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNelson&rsquo;s right that the sequester&rsquo;s across-the-board cuts <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-sequestration-cuts-will-be-indis/\">don&rsquo;t allow for much fine distinction</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut was Nelson correct that the 2011 budget deal included &quot;a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately, and then a special committee was set up ... to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Budget Control Act of 2011</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome viewers argued the cuts Nelson described as going into effect &quot;immediately&quot; were limits on future growth, hardly immediate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/24/barack-obama/obama-says-congress-owns-sequestration-cuts/\">the deal</a>: In summer 2011, the federal government was reaching its legal debt limit, which meant Congress had to authorize a higher level for borrowing to cover its spending. House Republicans insisted that spending cuts go along with an increase to the debt limit. After rancorous debate, lawmakers passed the <a href=\"http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.112s365\">Budget Control Act of 2011</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe law set up caps on future discretionary spending that the <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42754\">Congressional Budget Office</a> estimated would reduce spending by about a trillion dollars between 2012 and 2021, compared with what it would have been if annual appropriations grew at the rate of inflation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe cuts weren&rsquo;t specified, but would be carried out by lawmakers during the annual appropriations process, with a trigger for across-the-board cuts if they busted the caps. (There were exceptions for certain kinds of spending, such as for war or disasters.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s not exactly the same as &quot;a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe law also established a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, the &quot;special committee&quot; that Nelson mentioned. The Budget Control Act required a 12-member panel, half from each party, to suggest legislation to reduce the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion over 10 years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf that process failed &mdash; and it did &mdash; the law required the sequester. That&rsquo;s what happens March 1 if Washington does nothing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNelson said &quot;$3 trillion of cuts&quot; -- not $1.2 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis press secretary, Ryan Brown, noted &quot;there was no specific amount the committee had to cut in the legislation, or a limit to how much they could cut.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s true if you mean cuts in spending, rather than cuts in the deficit &mdash; the law required the committee to achieve at least $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction, not necessarily spending cuts. Raising taxes would also reduce the deficit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBrown explained that Nelson had <em>hoped</em> the committee &quot;would do another $1.5 trillion to $3 trillion in deficit reduction.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut that&rsquo;s not what Nelson said. He told TV viewers the committee was set up &quot;to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts,&quot; as though that were part of the deal reached by lawmakers in the Budget Control Act.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere was a <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-10-26/business/35276808_1_tax-increases-democratic-leadership-aides-congressional-democrats\">$3 trillion proposal</a> floating around at the time. It was a deal offered to the deficit reduction committee in October 2011 by congressional Democrats.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven that proposal, as it was described in news accounts, didn&rsquo;t include $3 trillion in spending cuts,&nbsp; Rather, it was a package that included cuts, tax increases and new spending that would have trimmed $3 trillion from federal deficits over a decade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRepublican House Speaker John Boehner <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-10-27/politics/35277697_1_house-speaker-john-boehner-tax-hikes-democrats\">rejected the offer</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNelson said the 2011 budget deal included &quot;a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately, and then a special committee ... to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNelson missed some things here.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe trillion dollars in savings in the Budget Control Act take place over 10 years (not immediately), and must be implemented by lawmakers through the annual appropriations process.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeanwhile, the committee charged with further cutting the deficit had to reduce it by $1.2 trillion to avoid the sequester, not get agreement on $3 trillion in cuts, as Nelson said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&rsquo;s partially accurate, but misses some important details.
