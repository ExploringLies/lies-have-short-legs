Tom Kean recently claimed he &quot;built the last nuclear plant -- not only in the state, but in the country.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe remark, published in an Aug. 1 question-and-answer column in The Star-Ledger, was in response to the question: &quot;Hearings began this week on Gov. Christie&rsquo;s new energy plan, which includes a nuclear component. Realistically, do you think New Jersey would accept a new nuclear plant?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKean, a Republican, replied: &quot;I built the last nuclear plant -- not only in the state, but in the country. It wasn&rsquo;t easy politically, but Republicans and Democrats got together and acted for the future of the state. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to rely totally on fossil fuels, as of now, there are not enough alternatives. If we want efficient, cheap, nonpolluting energy, we may have to accept a new plant.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut did Kean really build the last nuclear power plant in the state and the nation?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe&rsquo;s right about New Jersey, but wrong about the country -- though it&rsquo;s worth noting that during his tenure as governor, one of the last nuclear power plants of its kind to be built in the United States started commercial operations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNew Jersey is home to four nuclear power plants.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Oyster Creek plant in Lacey Township in Ocean County is operated by Illinois-based Exelon Generation. PSEG Nuclear, a subsidiary of PSEG Power, operates the other three plants -- Salem 1, Salem 2 and the Hope Creek Generating Station, all of which are in the same complex in Lower Alloways Creek Township in Salem County.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHope Creek and Oyster Creek are two of 23 boiling water reactors in the United States with General Electric Mark I containment systems -- &nbsp;similar to the ones at Japan&rsquo;s ill-fated Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which sparked a nuclear crisis after it sustained damage from a massive earthquake in March. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKean told PolitiFact New Jersey he was referring to Hope Creek and said he was basing his statement on a conversation he had with an expert at a nuclear conference he recently attended. But data from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission shows -- and a spokesman for the agency confirmed -- that Hope Creek wasn&rsquo;t the last nuclear plant built in the nation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to data from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a construction permit for Hope Creek was issued on Nov. 4, 1974.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJoe Delmar, spokesman for PSEG Nuclear, said actual &quot;shovel in the ground&quot; construction began in 1976. In July 1986 -- &nbsp;during the beginning of Kean&rsquo;s second gubernatorial term -- an operating license was issued for the plant and commercial operations began there that December, according to the federal nuclear agency&rsquo;s data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tConstruction hasn&rsquo;t started on any new nuclear power plants in New Jersey since -- though PSEG Power and PSEG Nuclear have submitted an application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review whether its Salem County site could support another nuclear power plant.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s take a look at nuclear power plants throughout the country.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause Kean took office in 1982, after construction had begun on Hope Creek, we&rsquo;re only going to focus on nuclear power plants that started commercial operations after Hope Creek.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf 104 nuclear power plants in operation in the U.S., 19 started operating commercially after Hope Creek, according to federal data.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe last reactor to start commercial operations in the United States is the Watts Bar nuclear plant in Tennessee in 1996.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tScott Burnell, spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the Tennessee Valley Authority, which operates Watts Bar, has had a valid construction permit for a second reactor at the same location, and has applied for an operating license. The federal agency expects to have a final decision on that application next year, Burnell said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBack to Kean&rsquo;s statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe former governor said he &quot;built the last nuclear plant -- not only in the state, but in the country.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHope Creek was completed during Kean&rsquo;s tenure and it is the last nuclear plant built in New Jersey. So he&rsquo;s right there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut, a spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Hope Creek isn&rsquo;t the last nuclear power plant to be built in the United States.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKean would be correct if he had said he built one of the last nuclear power plants of its kind in the United States. But he didn&rsquo;t specify, so we rate the statement Half True.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/nj_nuclear_power_plant.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-08-05T15:03:33.668547", "ruling_date": "2011-08-09T05:15:00", "ruling_headline": "Former Gov.
