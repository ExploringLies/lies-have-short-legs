Jeff Stone (R-Greendale), makes that claim in a campaign flier that hit mailboxes the last week of March.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe flier recites a litany of newspaper stories that exposed issues from Abele&rsquo;s past. We decided to zero in on the college degree one because questions remain about Abele&rsquo;s academic career.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbele pointedly <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/118192534.html\">evaded </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/118192534.html\">questions</a> about why he didn&rsquo;t finish at Lawrence University during a high-profile campaign appearance March 17, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo did Abele &quot;drop out&quot; three times?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Stone to explain.

Abele campaign spokesman Brandon Lorenz said he did not know how many credits short Abele was when he left Lawrence in 1994.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said the campaign would not have time on short notice to find an academic transcript, and could not provide a r&eacute;sum&eacute;.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Chris doesn&rsquo;t have a r&eacute;sum&eacute;,&quot; Lorenz said. &quot;That&rsquo;s why we can&rsquo;t provide one to you.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s take a look, college by college.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tAbele started at private Bennington College in Vermont, attending for a year in 1986, according to Lorenz. The school does not release information on students without student permission.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tLorenz said Abele moved on to Boston University, a private school. The university said it could not confirm or deny Abele attended there, unless he gives permission. The university has a Christopher Abele in its database, but he has asked that no information be released, an official in the registrar&rsquo;s office said. Lorenz said Abele was not a full-time student there. But it&rsquo;s unclear when and for how long.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tLawrence officials told us Abele attended from 1991 to 1994, with the last semester abroad at a school in London. The release of information on credits earned would have to be authorized by Abele, the university&rsquo;s registrar&rsquo;s office said.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2002, Abele was referred to as a Lawrence graduate in <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2002/11/18/story2.html\">The Business Journal&rsquo;s story </a>on a move to Milwaukee of the Argosy Foundation, run by Abele&rsquo;s family. Similarly, a 2002 online newsletter posted by a national nonprofit referred to Abele as a graduate, citing his bio. A 2003 Journal Sentinel <a href=\"http://www.lawrence.edu/dept/communications/media/lunews/fall02_win03.shtml\">profile of </a><a href=\"http://www.lawrence.edu/dept/communications/media/lunews/fall02_win03.shtml\">Abele</a> said only that Abele &quot;went to&quot; Lawrence.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Magazine reported in <a href=\"http://www.milwaukeemagazine.com/currentIssue/full_feature_story.asp?NewMessageID=26052\">a Feb. 1, 2005, </a><a href=\"http://www.milwaukeemagazine.com/currentIssue/full_feature_story.asp?NewMessageID=26052\">profile</a> that the official biography Abele provided the magazine&rsquo;s reporter said he graduated from Lawrence. That graduation claim was refuted by Lawrence officials in 2005, and they recently confirmed that for PolitiFact Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn our review, we found no evidence Abele has continued to circulate an inaccurate biography.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLorenz, the Abele spokesman, didn&rsquo;t dispute the &quot;dropout&quot; characterization in relation to Lawrence and Bennington.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe mildly challenged the term in relation to Boston University, saying, &quot;if you are not a full-time student I&rsquo;m not sure how to characterize that as dropping out.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHammelman responded: &quot;Tell him to prove&quot; he went part time at BU.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Stone campaign did not consider Abele&rsquo;s 1992 summer school courses in making its claim. Abele enrolled in two extension courses through Harvard University. Harvard officials said their records showed he did not complete the courses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Abele&rsquo;s campaign about Boston University and about his official bio.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRegarding BU, Lorenz would say only that Abele was contemplating a major in music at the time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRegarding Abele&rsquo;s biography, Lorenz provided a Feb. 15, 2005, letter to Milwaukee Magazine written on behalf of Abele by an Argosy Foundation official.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe letter says Abele&rsquo;s bio &quot;is compiled and sent out by assistants in the office, not Chris. However, Chris takes fulI responsibility for any errors and sincerely apologizes to anyone who feels they&#39;ve been misled or that he was being dishonest.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTime for a final grade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStone -- who officials at public Washburn University in Kansas say earned a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in 1983 -- claims Abele &quot;failed to finish&quot; at three schools, &quot;dropping out&quot; each time.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbele does not dispute that he did not finish college, and confirms he attended the three schools Stone cites. His campaign takes issue with the &quot;drop out&quot; charge only in the context of Boston University.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf we could determine that Abele entered Boston University intending to continue toward a degree, Stone&rsquo;s claim would likely rate True. Since we&rsquo;re looking at a Stone claim, the burden of proof is on him. Of course, it&rsquo;s Abele who won&rsquo;t provide the crucial details -- and the full context about his college history and background.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat puts us -- barring new information -- at Mostly True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-01T09:29:19.894006", "ruling_date": "2011-04-01T16:43:58", "ruling_headline": "Jeff Stone says Chris Abele, opponent in Milwaukee County executive race, dropped out of three separate colleges", "ruling_headline_slug": "jeff-stone-says-chris-abele-opponent-milwaukee-cou", "ruling_link_text": "Some details lacking on one \u2014 but lack of clarity is due to Abele as well", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tMilwaukee Magazine, <a href=\"http://www.milwaukeemagazine.com/currentIssue/full_feature_story.asp?NewMessageID=26052\">&quot;The Billionaire&rsquo;s Son,</a>&quot; February 1, 2005<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/118192534.html\">&quot;Abele avoids specifics on cuts, college degree,</a>&quot; March 17, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Business Journal, <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2002/11/18/story2.html\">Foundation Moving to Milwaukee</a>, Nov. 17, 2002<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews with Brandon Lorenz, Abele campaign spokesman, March 29-30<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Vi Rowley Hammelman, Stone campaign manager, March 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Mark Kass, editor, The Business Journal, March 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Mary Van de Kamp Nohl, former staff writer at Milwaukee Magazine, March 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with John Fennell, former editor, Milwaukee Magazine, March 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterviews with registrar&rsquo;s office officials, Bennington College, Boston University, Lawrence University, Harvard University extension, March 30, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with registrar&rsquo;s office officials, Washburn University, March 29, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Member of State Assembly, 82nd District", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Jeff", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 940, "last_name": "Stone", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "jeff-stone", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Jeff_Stone.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/940/", "total_count": 5, "true_count": 2, "website": "http://legis.wisconsin.gov/w3asp/contact/legislatorpages.aspx?house=Assembly&district=82"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Chris Abele, opponent in Milwaukee County executive race, &quot;failed to finish 3 separate colleges, dropping out all 3 times.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "a campaign flier", "statement_date": "2011-04-01", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 13, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/13/", "subject": "Candidate Biography", "subject_slug": "candidates-biography", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "Philanthropist", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "", "id": 959, "last_name": "Abele", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "chris-abele", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Abele_Chris_PFACT_2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/959/", "total_count": 22, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://chrisabele.com/"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
