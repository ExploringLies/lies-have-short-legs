The most recent report came out in 2010 and looks at the years 2002 to 2007. (The bureau will release the next report in 2015.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey defines Hispanic-owned businesses as those operating in the United States that &quot;self-identified 51 percent or more of their ownership&hellip; to be by individuals of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or other Hispanic or Latino origin.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/business_ownership/cb10-145.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> the 2010 report</u></a>, the number of Hispanic-owned businesses grew 43.7 percent from 2002 to 2007. The national average growth rate was 18 percent, so Hispanic-owned businesses grew at a rate that was a little more than twice as fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the growth was not quite three times as fast as the national average, so we jumped back five years to the previous business owners survey results, <a href=\"http://www2.census.gov/econ/sbo/02/sb0200cshisp.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>which came out in 2006</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This survey seems to contain the claims&rsquo; origin. Between 1997 and 2002, the national average growth rate for businesses was 10 percent, and the growth rate for Hispanic-owned business was 31 percent -- just over three times the national rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found a <a href=\"http://ushcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Geoscape_HispanicBusinessOwners_FINAL.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2013 report</u></a> by business intelligence firm Geoscape and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce that had some more recent data. The report projected that in 2013, there would be 3.16 million Hispanic-owned businesses in the United States -- a growth rate of 40 percent since 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Geospace report also said the average annual increase in Hispanic-owned firms during that time frame was 6.66 percent, compared to 3.14 percent annual growth among all U.S. firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Hispanic population has been starting and growing new businesses at nearly twice the rate of the general population and this trend has continued for more than 10 years,&quot; the report says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Service areas and technology are among the top industries where this growth is happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The growth of Hispanic-owned businesses mirrors the country&rsquo;s rising Hispanic population. Between 2000 and 2010, the Hispanic population grew from 35.3 million to 54.1 million, which is more than a 50 percent growth, according to the <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Pew Hispanic Trends Project</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All businesses are responding to the growing Hispanic consumer base -- and their more than <a href=\"https://ahaa.org/default.asp?contentID=161\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$1 trillion purchasing power</u></a> -- &nbsp;said Javier Palomarez, CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hispanic community is generally aware of and responds well to Hispanic-led businesses, which might be aiding the growth, Palomarez said. He added that the Hispanic population is younger than the non-Hispanic population, which means they tend to be more technology-able and innovative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Libre Initiative said, &quot;The startup rate of Hispanic businesses is three times the national rate.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found data that showed the number of Hispanic-owned businesses growing at three times the national rate between 1997 and 2002. However, more recent data shows a growth rate of Hispanic-owned businesses that&rsquo;s closer to twice the national rate. The overall trend -- that Hispanic-owned businesses are popping up faster than other demographics -- is correct, though. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-08-11T17:57:19.068420", "ruling_date": "2014-08-12T10:31:30", "ruling_headline": "Conservative group says Hispanic business growth is three times faster than the national average", "ruling_headline_slug": "conservative-group-says-hispanic-business-growth-t", "ruling_link_text": "It's closer to two times as fast", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Libre Initiative,<a href=\"http://www.thelibreinitiative.com/about-us\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u> website, Facebook and Twitter</u></a>, accessed Aug. 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Geoscape, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.geoscape.com/HBR/pdf/Geoscape_HispanicBusinessOwners_FINAL.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hispanic Businesses &amp; Entrepreneurs Drive Growth in the New Economy</u></a>,&quot; 2013 report</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2013_latino_doc.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>An Economy Built to Last and Security for Latino Families,</u></a>&quot; 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Small Business Administration, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/community-blogs/small-business-matters/latinos-business-government-resources-hispani\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Latinos in Business: Government Resources for Hispanic Entrepreneurs</u></a>,&quot; Aug. 19, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, &quot;<a href=\"http://www2.census.gov/econ/sbo/02/sb0200cshisp.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hispanic-Owned firms: 2002,</u></a>&quot; Aug. 2006</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Census Bureau, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/business_ownership/cb10-145.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Census Bureau Reports Hispanic-Owned Businesses Increase at More Than Double the National Rate</u></a>,&quot; Sept. 21, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Associated Press, &quot;<a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/koch-brothers-reach-out-hispanics\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Koch Brothers reach out to hispanics,</u></a>&quot; Aug. 11, 2014<br />\r\nAHAA, &quot;<a href=\"https://ahaa.org/default.asp?contentID=161\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hispanic Fast Facts,</u></a>&quot; accessed Aug. 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pew Research, <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hispanic Trends Project</u></a>, accessed Aug. 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ProPublica, <a href=\"http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/koch\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>How Dark Money Flows Through the Koch Network</u></a>, Feb. 14, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Steven Cruz, Libre Initiative spokesman, Aug. 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Ammar Campa-Najjar, U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce spokesman, Aug. 11, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phone interview, Javier Palomarez, U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce CEO, Aug. 11, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "", "id": 2906, "last_name": "LIBRE Initiative", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "libre-initiative", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 16, "party": "Organization", "party_slug": "organization", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/16/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Libre.png", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2906/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;The startup rate of Hispanic businesses is three times the national rate.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Facebook post", "statement_date": "2014-08-10", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "<p>Amnesty,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">self-deportation</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/28/donald-trump-mexico-immigration-presidential-campaign\">wall</a>.
