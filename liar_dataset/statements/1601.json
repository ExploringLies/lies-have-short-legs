Bush through  nearly two terms as governor and two more as president, recently issued a  barbed claim about Democrats paying back Kay Bailey Hutchison.</p>\r\n<p>Rove,  whose clients before Bush bid for governor included Hutchison, writes  in his autobiography, &ldquo;Courage and Consequence, My Life as a  Conservative in The Fight&rdquo;: &ldquo;Kay Bailey Hutchison was elected state  treasurer, succeeding Ann Richards. Democrats then abolished the  position, which made me wonder if political payback is about the only  grounds on which Democrats abolish government posts. Hutchison later  became a U.S. senator.&rdquo; The book was released March 9.</p>\r\n<p>Rove correctly reflects on Hutchison  winning election as state treasurer in 1990, succeeding Richards, who  won election as governor.</p>\r\n<p>However, we're intrigued by Rove&rsquo;s  statements about what happened next: According to him, Democrats then  abolished the treasurer&rsquo;s position. Later, Hutchison was elected to the  U.S. Senate.</p>\r\n<p>Rove told us he stands by his account.</p>\r\n<p>Chronologically  speaking, for starters, it's not so: Hutchison won her Senate seat in  June 1993 while still serving as state treasurer, and the treasury  remained a stand-alone agency after Hutchison left for Washington.  Richards appointed an East Texas Democrat, Martha Whitehead, to serve  out Hutchison&rsquo;s term. Whitehead won election in her own right in 1994.</p>\r\n<p>So when -- and how -- was the treasurer's job abolished?</p>\r\n<p>According  to legislative records, the Democratic-majority 1995 Legislature  proposed a constitutional amendment abolishing the agency and shifting  its operations elsewhere.</p>\r\n<p>Contrary to Rove's take, it wasn&rsquo;t a  move backed solely by Democrats. Senate Joint Resolution 1 was authored  by Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, and sponsored in the House by Reps.  Mark Stiles, D-Beaumont, and Bill Siebert, R-San Antonio. The proposed  amendment cleared the Senate by 23-7 with five Republicans and two  Democrats voting \"no\" and the House by 107-18 with several Republicans  who voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; saying afterward they&rsquo;d intended to vote &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; according  to Senate and House journals.</p>\r\n<p>Texas voters approved the change  by 69 percent to 31 percent in November 1995. And Whitehead--who&rsquo;d  campaigned for election vowing to eliminate the agency&mdash;marked her last  day in office Aug. 31, 1996 by scraping her name and title off the glass  front of the agency&rsquo;s Austin headquarters. &ldquo;I am the last treasurer of  the State of Texas,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n<p>Another Democrat, State  Comptroller John Sharp, had proposed the agency&rsquo;s abolition in a report  issued in 1994, after Hutchison was already in the Senate. His report  called the treasury a &ldquo;bureaucracy with an annual operating budget of  more than $11 million whose most important tasks are duplicated  elsewhere across state government&hellip; Consolidating the bulk of the State  Treasury's responsibilities with those of the Comptroller's office would  cut costs, improve services and maintain accountability. It would also  offer Texans the chance to prove that they're serious about reducing the  size of their state government.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>How does Rove&rsquo;s statement  shape up?</p>\r\n<p>As noted, he's correct that Hutchison succeeded  Richards as treasurer. But he's wrong about the order of subsequent  events, and assigns an unsupported motive&mdash;that Democrats abolished the  agency because a Republican had its top spot. Some Republicans backed  the abolition, too, and it was Hutchison&rsquo;s Democratic successor whose  stint in the office came to a sign-scraping close.</p>\r\n<p>We rate  Rove&rsquo;s poor job of retelling history as False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-03-18T18:20:54.781528", "ruling_date": "2010-03-19T11:51:39", "ruling_headline": "Karl Rove writes that Democrats abolished state treasurer's office after she won it and she later became senator", "ruling_headline_slug": "karl-rove-writes-democrats-abolished-state-treasur", "ruling_link_text": "Treasury shut down years after Hutchison elected to Senate", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Associated  Press, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/08311996_statetreasuryclose.doc\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;150-year-old   Treasury scratched into history,&rdquo;</a> published in Austin  American-Statesman, Aug. 31, 1996</p>\r\n<p>E-mail, Dana Perino,  spokeswoman for Karl Rove, March 17, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Interview, Karl Rove,  March 18, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Texas House Journal, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/05191995_texashousejournal\" target=\"_blank\">Record   Vote 471 (SJR 1)</a>, May 19, 1995<br /> <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/03161995_txsenatejournal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/03161995_txsenatejournal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Texas   Senate Journal</a>, March 16, 1995 (votes on SJR 1)</p>\r\n<p>Karl Rove,  &ldquo;Courage and Consequence, My Life as a Conservative in The Fight,&rdquo; 2010,  p. 58</p>\r\n<p>State Comptroller of Public Accounts, Texas Performance  Review,<a href=\"http://www.window.state.tx.us/tpr/tprgg/gggengov.html\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Gaining   Ground, General Government,&rdquo;</a> accessed March 17, 2010</p>\r\n<p>Texas  Secretary of State, <a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/11071995_constlamendresults\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Historical   Election Results, 1995 Constitutional Amendment Election,&rdquo;</a> accessd  March 17, 2010</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 2, "current_job": "", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Karl", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 177, "last_name": "Rove", "mostly_true_count": 8, "name_slug": "karl-rove", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/rove2.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/177/", "total_count": 17, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.rove.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\"Kay Bailey Hutchison was elected state treasurer,  succeeding Ann Richards.
