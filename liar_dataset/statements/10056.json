He has repeatedly acknowledged that he raised taxes three times during his six years in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he also inherited a huge pension problem, a budget that had $1.5 million in phony savings, and a school committee that had spent about $8 million it didn&#39;t have. His first year in office was marked by a massive cut in state aid that rocked cities and towns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, with the Great Recession in full swing, it didn&#39;t get easier for him or other mayors. For example, early in his term, general revenue sharing, where the state gave about $55 million from sales and income taxes to municipalities, was eliminated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he and the city ultimately stabilized the budget and during the last three of his six years in office, the city has not raised taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, the statement in the American LeadHERship commercial is accurate.
