Now I realize that few actions have given me as much satisfaction. The walk-on quarterback has won the Super Bowl!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith, who chairs the House Committee on Science &amp; Technology, joined several fellow Republican House committee chairs in <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2016/05/14/4-texas-congressmen-including-pete-sessions-and-jeb-hensarling-endorse-trump\">endorsing</a> Trump&rsquo;s candidacy on May 14, 2016. Was he also the first member of Congress to make a contribution to the New York businessman?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Smith reported donations starting in May 2016</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We emailed Smith consultant Jordan Berry seeking Smith&rsquo;s factual backup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then we called the Federal Election Commission, repository for candidate finance reports, where Julia Queen helped us ascertain that Smith&rsquo;s campaign committee, Texans for Lamar Smith, <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?201607159020558179\">reported giving</a> the Donald J. Trump for President committee $2,000 on May 27, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our searches of FEC-posted summaries of Trump&rsquo;s campaign finance filings show too that Trump <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?201610279036950773\">reported fielding</a> $1,913 from Smith&rsquo;s campaign on Oct. 5, 2016. Trump&rsquo;s campaign also listed $5,000 received Oct. 5, 2016, from the Maryland-based Longhorn PAC, a &quot;leadership PAC&quot; affiliated with Smith, <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00402602\">according to a PAC filing</a> with the FEC. Trump&rsquo;s finance report <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?201610279036950768\">also states</a> &quot;excess to be refunded&quot; from the $5,000, without elaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our request for research help from the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/\">Center for Responsive Politic</a>s, which tracks campaign contributions and spending, drew an email from spokeswoman Viveca Novak noting the Smith-led Longhorn PAC earlier reported giving Trump&rsquo;s campaign $3,000 on May 27, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the FEC-posted summary of the Longhorn PAC&rsquo;s donations to campaigns, <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?201608199022553966\">the group also gave $1,000</a> on June 14, 2016 to a Massachusetts-based Trump Victory group. Even earlier, the Smith-steered group <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?15971219824\">donated $5,000 in May 2015</a> to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz&rsquo;s presidential campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All told then, Smith&rsquo;s campaign and his Longhorn PAC reported making three Trump campaign donations totaling $6,000 from May 27, 2016 into October 2016. Trump&rsquo;s campaign reported $6,913 in two Smith-connected contributions in October 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A wrinkle: The contributions reported by Smith didn&rsquo;t show up in the FEC-posted summaries of Trump&rsquo;s reports, far as we could tell, nor did some of what Trump reported getting from Smith&rsquo;s committee or leadership PAC appear in Smith&rsquo;s filings. Significantly, though, Berry told us by email that Smith&rsquo;s records show the May 2016 Smith campaign committee and leadership PAC checks made out to the Trump campaign were each cashed in mid-June 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other members of Congress?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how about other members of Congress ponying up for Trump?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our review of Trump&rsquo;s FEC list of other campaigns giving to his effort didn&rsquo;t turn up other House members making donations prior to July 2016. Starting that month, five other Republican House members made donations from respective campaign funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listed among more than 60 contributions from other political committees reported by Trump up to Oct. 18, 2016:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--The <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00402602\">Lone Star Leadership PAC</a>, affiliated with Texas Rep. <a href=\"https://burgess.house.gov/\">Michael Burgess</a>, R-Flower Mound, gave two donations totaling $10,000 on July 21, 2016, the same day Burgess&rsquo; campaign gave two donations totaling $4,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--A $2,000 donation from Rep. <a href=\"https://calvert.house.gov/\">Ken Calvert</a> of California on Sept. 9, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--Rep. <a href=\"https://scalise.house.gov/\">Steve Scalise</a> of Louisiana donated $2,000 on Sept. 26, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--Rep. <a href=\"https://meadows.house.gov/\">Mark Meadows</a> of North Carolina gave $1,994 in multiple in-kind donations in October 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--Rep. <a href=\"https://mcclintock.house.gov/\">Tom McClintock</a> of California gave $2,000 on Oct. 5, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s campaign otherwise reported that a former House member, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/rep-dan-burton-republican-from-indiana-to-retire/2012/01/31/gIQAAnI7eQ_blog.html\">Dan Burton</a> of Indiana, made two contributions totaling $2,700 in July 2016 and <a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-todd-wilcox-marco-rubio-20160624-story.html\">Todd Wilcox</a>, a former Florida U.S. Senate aspirant, donated $2,000 in October 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The center&rsquo;s Daniel Auble said by email that for candidate committees and leadership PACs, Smith was the first sitting member of Congress to contribute to Trump&rsquo;s bid. But in 2017, Smith will be sworn in with a new member of Congress who gave even earlier to Trump. <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/11/08/michigan-congress-district-accavitti-walberg-results/93499830/\">Paul Mitchell</a>, a Michigan Republican, made a $292 in-kind donation to Trump&rsquo;s campaign in February 2016, Auble said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No personal donations by Smith</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also explored whether Smith put personal money, not campaign funds, into Trump&rsquo;s cause. Our search on the FEC website for Trump donors whose names include &quot;Lamar&quot; <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kkOiAWUCUGcWRvaVF6UnJGZzA/view?usp=sharing\">didn&rsquo;t reveal personal Lamar Smith contributions to the presidential hopeful.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across Texas, according to the FEC, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17kgeJ8DvC0QRkMMZd9r9jEKf0eLogmBbjy2teHjQWjE/edit?usp=sharing\">Trump&rsquo;s campaign reported</a> accepting 135 contributions totaling $45,253 from September 2015 through Oct. 19, 2016. Those donors in 2016 included three San Antonio Smiths, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M7JGfSHw5jvP7cHCm9h5NQ11tt4H9YO1yj0bsooz6zE/edit?usp=sharing\">Trump&rsquo;s committee reported</a>, none named Lamar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And did other House members make personal donations to Trump before Smith&rsquo;s campaign chipped in? We didn&#39;t close in on this ourselves but Auble said his &quot;quick scan&quot; of individual donations posted by the FEC didn&rsquo;t turn up anyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith said: &quot;I was the first member of Congress to contribute to&quot; Trump for president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corroborating records appear to be imperfect. But Smith reported contributions to the Trump cause in May 2016 and we didn&rsquo;t find any sign of other members of Congress donating to Trump before July 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>TRUE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement is accurate and there&rsquo;s nothing significant missing.
