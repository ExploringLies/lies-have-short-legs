We will explain how he did it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>H-2B visas</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We couldn&rsquo;t reach a spokesman for Bloomberg, however, it&rsquo;s likely he was referring to Trump hiring foreign workers at his <a href=\"http://www.maralagoclub.com/\">Mar-A-Lago Club</a>, an exclusive eating club in a mansion in Palm Beach County, Florida. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz made a<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/may/06/ted-cruz/donald-trump-attacked-bringing-hundreds-foreign-wo/\"> similar attack during the primary</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The club has sought H-2B visas for low-skilled, low-wage workers such as cooks, wait staff and housekeepers. <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2b-temporary-non-agricultural-workers\">H-2B visas</a> are legal &mdash; Congress has set the cap at 66,000 per year &mdash; and its agricultural counterpart is the H-2A visa. The vast majority of the workers on these two visas programs nationwide are young Mexican men, although news reports say Trump sought workers from Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employers argue they need these temporary workers to fill jobs Americans don&rsquo;t want, while critics say the workers can be exploited. Since the visas are tied to a particular job, the foreigners can&rsquo;t simply jump ship for a better paying job at another resort. The <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/668875.pdf\">worker is paid</a> based on the prevailing wage or minimum wage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2010, nearly 300 U.S. residents applied or were referred for jobs at Mar-A-Lago, but only 17 were hired, the <em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/us/politics/donald-trump-taps-foreign-work-force-for-his-florida-club.html?_r=1\">New York Times</a> </em>reported in February. Meanwhile, Mar-A-Lago sought more than 500 visas for foreign workers. (The visas were also sought at some of his other properties.) We don&rsquo;t know how many people actually used the visas and became employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To obtain the visas, businesses must prove they were unsuccessful at filling positions with Americans or legal residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, the resort posted jobs through CareerSource Florida, the local workforce development boards throughout the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A U.S. Labor Department spokesman told PolitiFact Florida previously that 93 people applied for 250 seasonal job openings at the resort. Four were hired, while 79 didn&rsquo;t answer interview requests or turned down jobs (10 applications were classified with unknown status).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Documents the resort later filed with the Labor Department showed that many of the American applicants weren&rsquo;t hired because they didn&rsquo;t meet requirements. Some applicants didn&rsquo;t want to work split shifts, lacked experience, wanted full-time jobs instead of part time, or didn&rsquo;t respond when the resort contacted them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that process, the Labor Department <a href=\"https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm\">certified 685 H-2B visas</a> for the Mar-A-Lago Club between 2008 and 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>New York Times</em> asked Trump why he hired so many foreign workers when Americans applied for the same positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The only reason they wouldn&rsquo;t get a callback is that they weren&rsquo;t qualified, for some reason,&quot; Trump replied. &quot;There are very few qualified people during the high season in the area.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But some experts question Trump&rsquo;s assessment that it&rsquo;s hard to find local help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, CareerSource assisted in placing nearly 1,800 candidates in hospitality jobs in Palm Beach County. But Mar-A-Lago didn&rsquo;t show much interest in using the free service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Veenstra, senior director of support services at CareerSource in Palm Beach County, told PolitiFact Florida that the first time his office received a request for helping finding workers was September 2015. (That was shortly after one of the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-exclusive-idUSKCN0Q62RQ20150802\">first news reports</a>, by Reuters, about Trump&rsquo;s foreign hiring practices.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since that time, Mar-A-Lago used the office to hire just one person, a banquet server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We called the HR director after the hire, and she said they were pleased with the hire and the candidates we sent them,&quot; Veenstra said. &quot;There has been nothing else since then.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So is Trump gaming the system?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gabriel &quot;Jack&quot; Chin, a professor at University of California Davis School of Law, said many of these companies say they can&rsquo;t find American workers but only put in minimal effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;One answer is &lsquo;yes, this is gaming the system, but everybody does it,&rsquo; in the sense that the labor certification standards are widely thought to be evaded in the way that Mar-A-Lago has done in the past,&quot; Chin said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump spokesman Stephen Miller referred us to Trump&rsquo;s reply during the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/10/the-cnn-miami-republican-debate-transcript-annotated/\">March 10 debate in Miami</a> when he defended the use of these visas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m a businessman,&quot; Trump said. &quot;These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We&#39;re allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries -- the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it&#39;s very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete. So I will take advantage of it; they&#39;re the laws. But I&#39;m the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miller said that Trump has opposed <a href=\"http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/special-reports/guide-s744-understanding-2013-senate-immigration-bill\">legislation</a> to expand the visa program and pledged to reform <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform\">visa programs</a> to protect American workers. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bloomberg says Trump &quot;games the U.S. visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump sought visas for hundreds of foreign workers to fill temporary positions at his Mar-A-Lago Club in Florida in recent years. Hundreds of U.S. applicants either applied or were referred for the jobs, but only a handful were hired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is some debate about whether those applicants were qualified or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump has used a legal program to obtain workers with H-2B visas. Saying he &quot;games&quot; the system is harsh language, and an expert says the process used by Trump is common.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/90e178aa-a06c-4fa1-913f-1777415af770\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/90e178aa-a06c-4fa1-913f-1777415af770</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-07-27T21:01:28.460071", "ruling_date": "2016-07-27T21:51:54", "ruling_headline": "Bloomberg says Trump bashes immigrants yet hires overseas workers", "ruling_headline_slug": "michael-bloomberg-donald-trump-visa-sys", "ruling_link_text": "H-2B visa program is legal", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Washington Post</em> The Fix, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/10/the-cnn-miami-republican-debate-transcript-annotated/\">&quot;The CNN Miami debate transcript, annotated,&quot;
