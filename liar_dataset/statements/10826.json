Border security for sure. Unlike this president, I&rsquo;ve actually gone to the border and been there with the governor of Texas,&quot; Walker said, referring to a trip he made a month earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait, what?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immigration has long been a huge national issue.

Changes in policy to expand legal residence opportunities in the United States for undocumented youth may have led some families to send younger family members on the journey north.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the crisis at the border, &nbsp;Obama altered his plans to include a meeting, in Dallas, with then-Gov. Rick Perry and local officials to discuss the situation at the border. But Obama -- resisting calls from lawmakers in both parties -- did not visit the border, although several senior members of his administration had done so. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More to the point of Walker&rsquo;s claim, however, the news report he cited also said Obama had visited the border in May 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found that Obama visited El Paso on May 10, 2011.
