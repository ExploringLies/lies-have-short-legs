Elliott Naishtat</a>, D-Austin, made a claim about the not-so-youthful Texas Legislature that made us wonder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huey Rey Fischer, 23, said in a Feb. 8, 2016, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1558JI1IksgdCnM-jSuRSUI1Mbpmt5Mn1_-kTSFVHMZw/pub\">press release</a> touting endorsements by University of Texas students: &quot;The students are taking me to the Capitol! There isn&rsquo;t a single legislator under the age of 30, even though millennials make up 25 percent of the electorate in Texas. This is our opportunity to change that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are there no elected 20-somethings under the dome while Texans born in the &lsquo;80s or &lsquo;90s -- a dictionary definition of <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/millennial\">&quot;millennials&quot;</a> -- comprise a quarter of the state&rsquo;s voting population?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short answers: Texas indeed has no legislators under age 30 and, depending on how you define millennials, you could make a case for such Texans comprising close to a quarter of the electorate, though this element needs unpacking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Counting younger legislators</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To our request for Fischer&rsquo;s factual backup, his campaign manager, Allison Heinrich, noted by email a Texas Legislative Reference Library <a href=\"http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legeLeaders/members/memberStatistics.cfm\">chart</a> indicating that as of the 2015 legislative session, no legislators were younger than 30 -- which was still so, per state records, after two empty House seats were filled that year. <a href=\"http://www.house.state.tx.us/members/member-page/?district=13\">Leighton Schubert</a>, R-Brenham, was 32 on his election to represent the 13th district, and the winner of special election to represent the 123rd district, <a href=\"http://www.house.state.tx.us/members/member-page/?district=123\">Diego Bernal</a>, D-San Antonio, was 38.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that shutout of anyone under 30 also was unusual, <a href=\"http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legeLeaders/members/memberStatistics.cfm\">according to library charts</a> breaking down legislative demographics from 1995 on. The charts show at least one House member under age 30 at the start of each biennial regular session through 2013 -- and twice, in 2003 and 2007, the House had five members younger than 30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Millennials</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, do millennials comprise about a quarter of the state&rsquo;s electorate, <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/electorate\">meaning</a> residents eligible to vote?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heinrich told us Fischer&rsquo;s conclusion was based on dividing a projection of the number of 18- to 29-year-old Texas residents in 2014 -- 4,718,725 -- by the 18,915,297 people who made up the state&rsquo;s voting-age population as of the November 2014 governor&rsquo;s election, according to the Texas Secretary of State, the state&rsquo;s chief elections officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That math works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Fischer might not have taken the best route to estimating millenials among us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heinrich told us Fischer&rsquo;s count of Texas adults under 30 came to her from Nick Dauster of the Department of State Health Services, who said in a 2015 email answering Heinrich&rsquo;s query that agency staff drew from data compiled by the Texas State Data Center to reach a 2014 projected population of 4,718,275 Texans aged 18-29, presuming 2000-2010 migration rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other analysts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For our part, we asked Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, about estimating the share of eligible-to-vote Texans aged 18-to-29.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, Potter said the candidate&rsquo;s cited estimate of Texans aged 18 to 29 accurately tracked center data. But, Potter said, U.S. Census Bureau 2014 population estimates released in June 2015 are considered more accurate. <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2014/PEPSYASEX?slice=GEO~0400000US48\">The bureau estimate</a> suggests there were 4,715,612 people aged 18 to 29 in Texas in 2014 -- about 2,600 down from Fischer&rsquo;s cited projection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Potter also wrote: &quot;Another factor to consider with this statement is the definition of electorate. If electorate means eligible to vote, consideration of citizenship and felony status should probably figure into the picture.&quot; His point: Some share of the voting-age population consists of residents not eligible to vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the Secretary of State&rsquo;s office about this aspect. Spokeswoman Alicia Pierce confirmed by email that its voting-age population figures posted for November 2014 included people &quot;not eligible to vote such as non-citizens and those convicted of a felony who have not fully discharged their sentence.&quot; She added: &quot;If electorate means all those who are eligible to vote, we do not have a firm number.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s at least one other way to estimate young voters. We took Pierce up on her offer to break out the share&nbsp;of registered Texas voters under 30. As of Feb. 20, 2016, according to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H907c0EB6inb-x3hLgyHATug58zjqYxKvlGbHptK6Oc/pubhtml\">the provided breakdown</a>, 2,725,526 Texas voters aged 18 through 29 were registered to vote, making up about 19 percent of the state&rsquo;s nearly 14.3 million registered voters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fischer comments</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fischer, provided what we&rsquo;d heard from Potter and Pierce, said by email he used the voting-age population to build his estimate of millennials in the state&rsquo;s electorate because he didn&rsquo;t identify a better statistic. He cautioned too that &quot;electorate&quot; takes in everyone qualified to vote, not just registered voters. &nbsp;&quot;As an aside,&quot; Fischer wrote, &quot;it is important to note that representatives are still called to represent felons, undocumented immigrants, non-citizen permanent residents, and others who may not be eligible to vote for a myriad of reasons.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fischer said: &quot;There isn&rsquo;t a single (Texas) legislator under the age of 30, even though millennials make up 25 percent of the electorate in Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Texas House and Senate each lacks&nbsp;legislators under age 30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But getting a fix on millenials in the Texas electorate can be slippery. Relying on an estimate of residents old enough to vote, as Fischer did, folds in people not eligible to vote--including non-citizens. On the other hand, nearly 20 percent of registered voters are millenials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><em><strong>MOSTLY TRUE</strong></em> &ndash; The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"> more</a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-26T22:22:38.402212", "ruling_date": "2016-02-26T21:34:40", "ruling_headline": "Huey Rey Fischer nails lack of Texas legislators under age 30, overstates possible millenial vote", "ruling_headline_slug": "huey-rey-fischer-nails-lack-texas-legislators-unde", "ruling_link_text": "Pass out the AARP cards", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<div><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xYdlz-2GMgMo4z4HzfCBM7d3uRfjKHE9s5fru9GALK0/pub\">Emails</a>, Allison Heinrich, campaign manager, Huey Rey Fischer campaign, Feb. 9 and 15, 2016</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Web post, <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>&quot;Millenials in adulthood,&quot;</u></a> Pew Research Center, March 7, 2014</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Web page, <a href=\"http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legeLeaders/members/memberStatistics.cfm\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>&quot;Member Statistics,&quot;</u></a> 74th Texas Legislature to 84th Legislature, Legislative Reference Library (accessed Feb. 15, 2015)</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wmtp10OO0Yj645zu4_f6PWoQIp9EaOqJZv_SCozWaPY/pub\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>Email</u></a>, Lloyd Potter, Texas state demographer, Feb. 16, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2014/PEPSYASEX?slice=GEO~0400000US48\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>Chart showing population estimates by age, Texas, as of July 2014,</u></a> U.S. Census Bureau, released June 2015 (accessed Feb. 18, 2016)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H907c0EB6inb-x3hLgyHATug58zjqYxKvlGbHptK6Oc/pubhtml\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><u>Chart showing Texas registered voters by age group</u></a> as of Feb. 20, 2016, Texas secretary of state (received by email from Alicia Pierce, communications director, Texas secretary of state, Feb. 18, 2016)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qp-ZBViDuQ8ltTm3WHVx7wO4jqiEexAIjAA0gqT3tWU/pub\">Email</a>, Huey Rey Fischer, Feb. 19, 2016</p>\r\n</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Huey Rey", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 3407, "last_name": "Fischer", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "huey-rey-fischer", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/fischerpft.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3407/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://hueyfischer.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;There isn&rsquo;t a single (Texas) legislator under the age of 30, even though millennials make up 25 percent of the electorate in Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a press release", "statement_date": "2016-02-08", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 42, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/42/", "subject": "History", "subject_slug": "history", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 293, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/293/", "subject": "Population", "subject_slug": "population", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/14/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
