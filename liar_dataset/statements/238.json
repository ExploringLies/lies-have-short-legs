We thought it would be odd if that were true, since Obama is a Christian. In fact, it is wrong.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe e-mail also spells the book&#39;s name &quot;Kuran,&quot; though usually it is spelled Koran or Quran.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwo press reports from Obama&#39;s swearing-in ceremony in January 2005 mention specifically that Obama took the oath of office by placing his hand on his own copy of the Bible. The Barack Obama campaign also confirmed that it was a Bible and that the book belonged to Obama. Vice President Dick Cheney, in his role as president of the Senate, administered the oath.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter being raised outside of any particular faith tradition, Obama became a Christian in his mid 20s and is a member of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. (Obama gave what are arguably his most extended remarks on his faith at the &quot;Call to Renewal&quot; religious conference in 2006; read the speech <a href=\"http://obama.senate.gov/speech/060628-call_to_renewal/\" target=\"_blank\"> here </a> .)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe suspect this false claim was inspired by the 2007 swearing-in of Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., an American convert to Islam and the first Muslim elected to Congress. Ellison used a Koran that once belonged to Thomas Jefferson, borrowing the rare book from the Library of Congress.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt goes without saying that Ellison is not Obama. And with its intent to inflame, we find the e-mail&#39;s allegation not only false, but Pants-on-Fire wrong.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>UPDATE: </strong> Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24908975/\" target=\"_blank\"> resigned from Trinity United Church of Christ </a> on May 31, 2008, after church pastor Jeremiah A.
