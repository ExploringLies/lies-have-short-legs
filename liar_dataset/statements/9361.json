He&rsquo;s headed to a third term! Or at least that&rsquo;s the claim now bouncing around the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reader recently emailed us to ask if we could check out something they&rsquo;d run into online -- a <a href=\"http://nationalreport.net/obama-announces-plans-third-term-presidential-run/\"><u>story</u></a> titled, &quot;Obama Announces Plans For A Third Term Presidential Run.&quot; As we&#39;ll see, it&#39;s another case of a satirical article being passed off as real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article with a Washington dateline began, &quot;President Barack Obama shocked the country this morning with news that he is running for a third term.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It went on to quote Obama at a press conference saying,&quot;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t abandon the American people now when they need me more than ever. We&rsquo;ve come this far as a nation, now is not the time to do something different. This is the change you wanted and this is the change you&rsquo;re getting.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article then quoted Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., telling CNN that he opposes Obama&rsquo;s decision. &quot;This defies everything the Constitution stands for,&quot; Paul is quoted as saying. &quot;We can not let this man have a third term.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem facing Obama, according to the article, is the 22nd Amendment, which prevents presidents from running for more than two terms. It was ratified in 1951.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the article suggests that Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., has &quot;recently introduced&quot; a measure to abolish the 22nd Amendment -- which is &quot;exactly the kind of news that makes an Obama 2016 Presidential run possible.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article closes with a comment from Paul Horner, purportedly an administration spokesman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Obama is guaranteed to win in 2016 and then we&rsquo;ll all be able to enjoy this great man for another four years,&quot; the article quotes &quot;Horner&quot; as saying. &quot;Things could not get any better for the American people. I&rsquo;m so stoked!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So is Obama really going to get around the Constitution to run for a third term?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, people passing along this story by email appear not to have noticed that it comes from a satire site called the National Report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site&rsquo;s tongue-in-cheek <a href=\"http://nationalreport.net/disclaimer/\"><u>disclaimer</u></a> says, in part, that &quot;the views expressed by writers on this site are theirs alone and are not reflective of the fine journalistic and editorial integrity of National Report.&quot; The urban-legend investigation site <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/satire/thirdterm.asp\"><u>Snopes.com</u></a> has archived an even clearer disclaimer that has since been removed. The former disclaimer <a href=\"http://message.snopes.com/politics/graphics/disclaimer.jpg\"><u>said</u></a>, &quot;National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it happens, <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2009/06/third-term-for-obama/\"><u>FactCheck.org</u></a> has been debunking similar &quot;third-term&quot; claims since 2009 -- the first year Obama was in office, when he was still three years away from running, legally, for his second term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These earlier chain emails tended to focus on the amendment by Serrano. The National Report satire piece is correct to say that Serrano has introduced such legislation, but it&rsquo;s hardly as recent a development as the article suggests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As FactCheck.org noted, Serrano introduced a similar measure numerous times during the presidencies of Bill Clinton (<a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:hj19ih.txt.pdf\"><u>1997</u></a>, <a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:hj17ih.txt.pdf\"><u>1999</u></a> and early <a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:hj4ih.txt.pdf\"><u>2001</u></a>) and George W. Bush (<a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:hj11ih.txt.pdf\"><u>2003</u></a>,<a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:hj9ih.txt.pdf\"> <u>2005</u></a> and<a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:hj8ih.txt.pdf\"> <u>2007</u></a>), with each bill dying in committee without coming to a vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I introduce it as a matter of principle,&quot; Serrano told FactCheck.org. &quot;I do not believe there should be term limits for any elected official. Elections should be the deciding factor. I do not receive advice or support on this bill from the White House or any other source.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-joint-resolution/15\"><u>current version</u></a> of Serrano&rsquo;s repeal bill has, as is typical, attracted no co-sponsors and gone nowhere in committee. No one should be under the illusion that this is an idea going anywhere soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked a White House spokesman if he wanted to comment. He politely declined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A chain email now circulating links to an article headlined, &quot;Obama Announces Plans For A Third Term Presidential Run.&quot; The article comes from a satire website, and even if Obama wanted to do an end run around the constitutional prohibition, the vehicle to do it -- Serrano&rsquo;s bill -- has no hope of passage, much less any chance of ratification in three quarters of the states. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.politifact.com/media/js/politifactwidget5.js\"></script>", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-05-23T11:42:50.066347", "ruling_date": "2014-05-23T12:05:48", "ruling_headline": "Rumors of third Barack Obama term are satire passed off as truth", "ruling_headline_slug": "rumors-third-barack-obama-term-are-satire-passed-t", "ruling_link_text": "Satire in disguise strikes again", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>National Report, &quot;Obama Announces Plans For A Third Term Presidential Run,&quot; May 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FactCheck.org, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2009/06/third-term-for-obama/\"><u>Third term for Obama?</u></a>&quot; June 18, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Snopes.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/satire/thirdterm.asp\"><u>Terms of Endearment</u></a>,&quot; May 20, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Fake_news", "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "", "false_count": 44, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "", "id": 27, "last_name": "Chain email", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "chain-email", "pants_count": 106, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-emailer.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/27/", "total_count": 180, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Obama Announces Plans For A Third Term Presidential Run&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a chain email", "statement_date": "2014-05-17", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 34, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/34/", "subject": "Legal Issues", "subject_slug": "legal-issues", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Michelle", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 58, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "michelle-obama", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-michelleobama.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/58/", "total_count": 10, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://www.barackobama.com/learn/meet.php#michelle"}], "twitter_headline": ""}
