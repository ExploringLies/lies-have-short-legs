The latest back-and-forth between incumbent Mark Pryor, a Democrat, and U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican, focused on Medicare funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each candidate accused the other of cutting funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Some politicians like Tom Cotton voted to cut Social Security, turn Medicare into a voucher system and raise the age of eligibility to 70,&quot; Pryor&#39;s ad said.&nbsp;&quot;Pryor cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare,&quot; Cotton&rsquo;s ad shot back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll address Cotton&rsquo;s Medicare claim in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/19/tom-cotton/sen-mark-pryor-cut-medicare-pay-obamacare-says-rep/\">separate fact-check</a>. Here, we&rsquo;ll focus on Pryor&rsquo;s statement about the voucher system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Cotton really vote for a voucher system? Cotton&rsquo;s office did not respond to our requests for comment, but we decided to look into it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact has looked at similar claims for years, and<strong> </strong>it&rsquo;s still hanging around in 2014 rhetoric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pryor&rsquo;s spokesman told us the ad was referencing the Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., budget plan. Ryan<strong> </strong>first introduced his plan as an alternative to the federal budget in 2009, but he modified it in subsequent years as it gained traction in the House. A big part of his proposal has been to rein in future costs for Medicare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pryor&rsquo;s spokesman correctly pointed out that Cotton did <a href=\"http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/113/house/1/88\"><u>vote in favor of</u></a> Ryan&rsquo;s budget proposal in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we noted in an <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/16/barack-obama/does-paul-ryan-want-turn-medicare-voucher-program/\"><u>earlier fact-check</u></a> in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election, we also need to determine if Ryan&rsquo;s proposed plan in 2013 qualifies as a &quot;voucher system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s debate in policy wonk circles about what constitutes a voucher system versus &quot;premium support,&quot; the term that Republicans prefer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan&rsquo;s latest plan, the one Cotton voter for, called for a flat payment to eligible seniors (at an increasing age for eligibility) to purchase private insurance or a traditional Medicare plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The value of the payment would be either equal to the second-cheapest private plan available in a given area, or the cost of traditional Medicare -- whichever is cheaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that Ryan leaves in the option for traditional Medicare is noteworthy here. That means people can opt to have their subsidy go toward the current system. So there&rsquo;s no mandatory move to a private plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a key difference from Ryan&rsquo;s 2011 proposal. The other big change is that the 2013 plan allows for a different method of indexing of cost growth, which ensures the payments to seniors keep up with the changing economy, according to both left- and right-leaning health policy experts we spoke to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could we consider this a &quot;voucher system&quot;? Paul Van de Water, a health policy expert at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, pointed us toward a book released in 2000 called <em>Vouchers and the Provision of Public Services</em>, which details voucher programs in several spheres, health care being one. A voucher is defined as &quot;a subsidy that grants limiting purchasing power to an individual to choose among a restricted set of goods and services.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Brookings Institution, published a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/409369-henry-aaron-paper.html\"><u>paper in 1995</u></a> that referred to Medicare reform as &quot;premium support&quot; but didn&rsquo;t totally rule out the voucher distinction. One distinction between vouchers and premium support is that a pure voucher system would mean handing people money not adjusted for inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Ryan&rsquo;s plan does adjust for cost growth by year. So it&rsquo;s not a perfect voucher system, which conservative health policy expert Robert Moffit at Heritage Foundation told us in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/16/barack-obama/does-paul-ryan-want-turn-medicare-voucher-program/\"><u>previous fact-check</u></a> would resemble a simpler system like airline vouchers for food and drink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yuval Levin, a health policy expert at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center told us he wouldn&rsquo;t consider the proposal a voucher system at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s definitely debate over semantics, but to the average voter (if not the average policy wonk), it seems like the word &quot;voucher&quot; would accurately describe the basics of Ryan&rsquo;s proposal (which, by the way, doesn&rsquo;t sound all that different from the healthcare.gov marketplaces for the uninsured). Calling programs like this &quot;voucher systems&quot; has been common in the field for years without negative connotations, Van de Water said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pryor&rsquo;s campaign ad said Cotton voted to turn Medicare into a voucher system. Liberal and conservative &nbsp;experts have debated whether it&rsquo;s a voucher system in every sense of the word. When we set aside the negative connotation that Democrats want to pin to Ryan&rsquo;s proposal by using the word &quot;voucher,&quot; we think<strong> </strong>it&rsquo;s still an accurate way to describe the process of encouraging seniors to shop for their own plans from private insurers. The &quot;voucher system&quot; is the colloquial way to refer to a program that gives people credit to purchase something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-19T15:29:23.667408", "ruling_date": "2013-11-19T17:55:13", "ruling_headline": "Rep.
