Chris Christie seems poised for <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/chris-christie-new-jersey-governor-2013-poll-97329.html\"><u>easy re-election</u></a> this November, one step on a path toward a possible 2016 presidential campaign. As Christie becomes a more prominent figure in the Republican Party, he&rsquo;s subject to more criticism on the national level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who oversees the Democratic National Committee, wrote a <a href=\"http://www.democrats.org/news/press/dnc_chair_debbie_wasserman_schultzs_statement_on_new_jersey_gubernatorial_d\"><u>statement</u></a> attacking Christie after a gubernatorial debate that gave us a taste of what we might hear more of over the next two years. For this fact-check, PolitiFact decided to hone in on her critique of the governor&rsquo;s wage policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He cut equal pay for women, calling it &lsquo;senseless bureaucracy,&#39;&nbsp;&quot; Wasserman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Senseless bureaucracy&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New Jersey state legislature passed a package of four bills in September 2012 designed to narrow the pay gap. Christie signed one, gave conditional vetoes to two and an absolute veto to the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of each bill in the package and Christie&rsquo;s actions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2012/Bills/A3000/2647_I1.HTM\"><u>A-2647</u></a>: Christie signed a statewide requirement for employers to notify employees of the right to be free from benefits and pay discrimination.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2012/Bills/A3000/2648_I1.HTM\"><u>A-2648</u></a>: This bill was designed to extend protections for employees who reveal discriminatory actions in their workplaces. Christie vetoed this bill conditionally, because he wanted it to fall under a different existing law than what was proposed by legislators. The bill became law in <a href=\"http://www.northjersey.com/news/Christie_signs_law_barring_employers_from_punishing_workers_who_share_pay_info_with_colleagues.html\"><u>August</u></a>, after Christie&rsquo;s changes were made.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2012/Bills/A3000/2649_I2.HTM\"><u>A-2649</u></a>: Christie gave this bill an absolute veto. It called for government contractors to report employee gender and compensation information to the NJ Department of Labor.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2012/Bills/A3000/2650_I1.HTM\"><u>A-2650</u></a>: This bill would grant back pay to victims of pay gap discrimination. Christie gave this a conditional veto because it didn&rsquo;t specify a limitation for how far back pay could go. It hasn&rsquo;t been passed.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Assembly Bill A-2649, the bill requiring government contractors to report compensation by gender and<strong> </strong>the only absolute veto of the bunch, is the one Wasserman Schultz referred to in her critique of Christie&rsquo;s attitude toward discrimination by gender. That&rsquo;s the bill Christie described as &quot;senseless bureaucracy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his <a href=\"http://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/552012/pdf/20120921g_A-2649AV.pdf\"><u>veto message</u></a>, he wrote that the bill<strong> </strong>&quot;will burden countless employers with onerous reporting requirements, thereby driving up the cost of public contracts, which are ultimately shouldered by the taxpayer<strong> </strong>...<strong> </strong>the reporting requirements fail to advocate sound policy over senseless bureaucracy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill&rsquo;s focus is on transparency surrounding pay, but it would not have directly required changes in salary by gender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yasemin Besen-Cassino, a Montclair State University sociology professor, conducted <a href=\"http://aauw-nj.aauw.net/files/2013/05/GenderPayGapNJ2010.pdf\"><u>research</u></a> on New Jersey&rsquo;s gender gap with the American Association of University Women. She said<strong> </strong>the bill Christie vetoed would&rsquo;ve helped narrow the wage divide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A lot of women claim they just don&rsquo;t know how much men make,&quot; Besen-Cassino said. &quot;One of the things that we found in our research was that making it public and at least available to a third party would push corporations toward equal pay.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a correlation between a greater level of pay equity in the federal government and also a greater level of transparency, an <a href=\"http://www.aauw.org/files/2013/03/The-Simple-Truth-Fall-2013.pdf\"><u>AAUW report</u></a> said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Mexico passed legislation a couple of years ago requiring contractors to report pay equity information. Fatima Goss Graves, National Women&rsquo;s Law Center vice president for education and employment, said the law has proven to be uncontroversial there. Vermont also has a similar law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that although Christie vetoed that bill and issued conditional vetoes for others, he has not abolished any existing equal pay legislation, as a reader might assume from the wording of Wasserman Schultz&rsquo;s comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The governor has never &lsquo;cut&rsquo; equal pay and he has a well-documented public position of supporting the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act (a national law) and equal pay for equal work,&quot; said Kevin Roberts, a campaign spokesman for Christie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christie <a href=\"http://www.state.nj.us/governor/news/news/552012/approved/20120921g.html\"><u>touted</u></a> the importance of A-2647 and asserted his support for equal pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Too often, women&#39;s value and contributions in the workplace have been undermined and shortchanged merely because of their gender,&quot; he said after signing the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Equal pay in New Jersey</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to take a look at the issue of equal pay in New Jersey on a broader scale and the implication that equal pay rights have not moved forward under Christie&rsquo;s leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.aauw.org/files/2013/09/New-Jersey-Pay-Gap-2013.pdf\"><u>median pay gap</u></a> suggests that a woman in the Garden State make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes. However, it&rsquo;s important to remember that this number doesn&rsquo;t control for factors like number of hours worked, occupation and race. The AAUW reports that one-third of the pay gap remains after these factors are controlled for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The national wage gap has not closed in the past decade, said Goss Graves of the National Women&rsquo;s Law Center. New Jersey&rsquo;s divide falls in the middle of the pack in terms of biggest wage differences, she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think that for Jersey, like the rest of the country, this problem has been pernicious and persistent and it&rsquo;s clear that we can&rsquo;t just wish it away,&quot; said Lisa Maatz, American Association of University Women vice president of government relations. &quot;We need some kind of legislative response.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wasserman Schultz said Christie &quot;cut equal pay for women, calling it a &lsquo;senseless bureaucracy.&rsquo; &quot; Christie didn&#39;t cut anyone&#39;s pay, though. Instead, he said it was &quot;senseless bureaucracy&quot; to&nbsp;require government contractors to report more employee information, including information about&nbsp;gender and compensation, and he vetoed a measure that would have mandated such reporting. Experts said the&nbsp;measure would have improved equal pay for women. But&nbsp;Christie also signed two other bills that may help narrow the wage gap in New Jersey. So we rate Wasserman Schultz&rsquo;s statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-10-16T15:05:42.250288", "ruling_date": "2013-10-17T12:07:51", "ruling_headline": "DNC chair says Chris Christie cut equal pay for women, called it \u2018senseless bureaucracy\u2019", "ruling_headline_slug": "dnc-says-chris-christie-cut-equal-pay-wome", "ruling_link_text": "He vetoed some equal pay bills, signed others", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>American Association of University Women, &quot;<a href=\"http://aauw-nj.aauw.net/files/2013/05/GenderPayGapNJ2010.pdf\"><u>Gender Pay Gap in New Jersey</u></a>,&quot;
