Democratic gubernatorial candidate <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/kathleen-falk/\">Kathleen Falk</a> posted a YouTube <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGHjv7F2Qwo&amp;feature=g-all-u&amp;context=G2f07870FAAAAAAAATAA\">video</a> that highlights her opposition to the repeal of a workplace discrimination law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWalker&rsquo;s signature on a Republican-backed bill repealed the right of discriminated workers to sue in state court for compensatory and punitive damages.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked why the right to sue in state court was needed, Falk told the Oshkosh Northwestern newspaper on April 17, 2012 it was because Wisconsin women &quot;are paid 81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe key phrase here, which Falk also <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/10/kathleen-falk/dem-wisconsin-governor-recall-says-gop-backed-bill/\">used</a> in a speech three weeks earlier, is same job.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs she right?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve done several items related to the 2009 law, passed when Democrats controlled state government, &nbsp;and its April 2012 repeal three times.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMost recently, we gave Falk a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/10/kathleen-falk/dem-wisconsin-governor-recall-says-gop-backed-bill/\">False</a> for saying the repeal left women with no options to fight pay discrimination (They could still pursue the claims through other avenues, including federal court) and Walker a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/27/scott-walker/recall-target-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-work/\">Mostly False</a> for saying the old law was &quot;kind of a gravy train&quot; for lawyers (no lawsuits had been filed while it was in place).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we asked Falk campaign spokesman Scot Ross for evidence to back the 81 cents vs. $1 claim, he cited an April 2012 <a href=\"http://womenscouncil.wi.gov/docview.asp?docid=19450&amp;locid=2\">report</a> by the <a href=\"http://www.cows.org/\">Center on Wisconsin Strategy</a> think tank and the <a href=\"http://womenscouncil.wi.gov/section.asp?linkid=45\">Wisconsin Women&rsquo;s Council</a>, a state government board that advocates for women.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report says that in 2009, Wisconsin women earned, on average, 81 cents for every dollar earned by men.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s the same figure Falk cited -- but it measures something quite different.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFalk said Wisconsin women earn 81 cents for every dollar earned by men for &quot;doing the same job.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat the report says is that -- considering all Wisconsin women and men in the workforce working all sorts of jobs -- women earn 81 cents for every dollar men earn.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe report underlines that point by saying that one reason Wisconsin women earn less than men on average is they are concentrated in occupations that pay lower wages, including in retail, services, education, nonprofits and health care.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLaura Dresser, associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, confirmed that the report does not say what Falk said it did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe could say case closed, but we wondered whether there are statistics measuring the pay of Wisconsin men and women who work in the same job.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDresser said she didn&rsquo;t know of any such studies, but suggested we contact the <a href=\"http://www.iwpr.org/about/about-us#mission\">Institute for Women&rsquo;s Policy Research</a>, a Washington, D.C. think tank. The institute provided us an April 2011 <a href=\"http://womenscouncil.wi.gov/docview.asp?docid=21576&amp;locid=2\">report</a> it did on women in Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe D.C. think tank examined a slightly different population -- adults who worked full time year round in 2009. Its report found that Wisconsin women earned 75 cents for every dollar earned by men.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut, again, that figure is for all occupations, not women and men working in the same job; and the D.C. think tank, like the Wisconsin groups in their report, noted that women tended to work in lesser-paying occupations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe did find evidence on the national level that women tend to be paid less than men in many occupations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.iwpr.org/publications/pubs/the-gender-wage-gap-by-occupation-updated-april-2011\">According</a> to the D.C. institute, among 111 occupations for which weekly median wage data could be estimated for 2010, men earned more than women in all but four occupations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe largest gap was among personal financial advisors, with women on average earning 58 cents for every $1 earned by men.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in relation to Falk&rsquo;s claim, those figures are national and apply to types of occupations, not to men and working the same job.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFalk said Wisconsin women &quot;are paid 81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job.&quot; To be sure, as a group women are paid less than men and they are in many individual instances.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut she misquoted the report she relied on.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat the report said is that, among all working men and women in Wisconsin working all sorts of jobs, women earn 81 cents for every dollar earned by men.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate Falk&rsquo;s &quot;same job&quot;
