The site features a line-item roster of tax-exempt items, along with a calculation of how much revenue each would generate if taxed at 1 percent. Textbooks, school meals and heating fuel are all there. And yes, so is the driving equipment for amputees. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we contacted the Chafee campaign to ask about the claim, they didn&rsquo;t flinch. Eliminating all sales-tax exemptions is a way to balance the budget and erase Rhode Island&rsquo;s massive deficit, said campaign manager John R. Pagliarini. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOK, but kids and amputees?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Rather than get into a situation where we&rsquo;re judging one priority over another, we&rsquo;re saying why don&rsquo;t we apply it uniformly so it&rsquo;s equitable, so we&rsquo;re not pitting one interest or one item against another,&quot; Pagliarini explained. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Democratic Governors Association slammed Chafee&rsquo;s proposal. &quot;The idea of taxing the men and women who have served our country and had an amputation in the course of their service? I couldn&rsquo;t find a single person that thinks that&rsquo;s a good idea,&quot; said spokeswoman Emily DeRose. <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Pagliarini called it &quot;very candid&quot; of the former senator to recognize that the state&rsquo;s budget problems demand dramatic solutions and said Chafee would undoubtedly revisit the exemptions issue once the state is &quot;back on solid footing.&quot; </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe bristled however at the suggestion that Chafee doesn&rsquo;t care about veteran&rsquo;s service.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;To say that he doesn&rsquo;t appreciate the contributions of men in uniform is not fair. His father was a decorated war veteran,&quot; Pagliarini said. (Chafee&rsquo;s father, the late Sen. John Chafee, served with the Marines in World War II and the Korean War.) <br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChafee&rsquo;s views on veterans aside, the Democratic Governors Association is correct about whom and what the gubernatorial candidate has proposed taxing. We find its claim True, though we suggest they make better use of spell check next time around.&nbsp; </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUPDATE: After this item was published, we learned that the driving equipment for amputee veterans would be paid for by the federal government for those injured in the line of duty. In such instances, the veterans are not taxed. However, because the Chafee campaign acknowledges that he would tax all items on a list of exemptions, it does not change the assertion that the former senator would tax the driving equipment. Therefore, the ruling stands.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-07-01T17:50:40.916958", "ruling_date": "2010-07-05T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Democrats say Chafee would tax amputee veterans", "ruling_headline_slug": "democrats-say-chafee-would-tax-amputee-veterans", "ruling_link_text": "Democratic group gets it right", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Senator Chafee.com,&quot; a &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.senatorchafee.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chafee attack website</a> run by the Democratic Governors Association, accessed June 23, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.chafeeforgovernor.com/issues/\" target=\"_blank\">Lincoln Chafee for Governor website</a>, accessed June 24, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.dor.ri.gov/taxexpenditure/2008%20Tax%20Expenditures%20Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2008 Tax Expenditures Report, Department of Revenue, Division of Taxation</a>, pages 1,2,4,5.<br />\r\n\tAccessed June 24, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Providence Journal, <a href=\"http://www.projo.com/news/content/political_scene_10_05-10-10_52IDCDQ_v22.347d22b.html\" target=\"_blank\">New website takes aim at Chafee&rsquo;s run for governor</a>, May 10, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Emily DeRose, Democratic Governors Association, June 24, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, John R.
