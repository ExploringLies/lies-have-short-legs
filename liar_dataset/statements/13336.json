Sometimes, we just like to fact-check claims about history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton dropped an intriguing nugget in our laps when she spoke at the <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4627131/clinton-al-smith-anti-catholicism\">Alfred E. Smith memorial dinner</a> in New York on Oct. 20, 2016. After making joke after joke at Donald Trump&rsquo;s expense, Clinton turned serious and reminded her audience of the anti-Catholic bigotry Al Smith faced when he ran for president in 1928. Most of the arguments against Smith stemmed from the belief that Smith would be a puppet for Rome and the pope. One conspiracy theory was that the pope and Smith would ban protestant versions of the Bible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is important to just reflect how groundbreaking it was for him, a Catholic, to be my party&#39;s nominee for president,&quot; she said. &quot;Don&#39;t forget, school boards sent home letters with children saying that if Al Smith is elected president, you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if that was so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clinton campaign pointed us to a <em>New York Times</em> article <a href=\"http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/10/when-a-catholic-terrified-the-heartland/?_r=0\">from 2011</a>. In the article, historian Robert Slayton at Chapman University described the hysteria stirred up by Smith&rsquo;s candidacy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Feelings were so strong that they swirled into a hurricane of abuse, a crescendo of fear and hate blasting through eight weeks,&quot; Slayton wrote. &quot;The school board of Daytona Beach, Fla., sent a note home with every student. It read simply: &lsquo;We must prevent the election of Alfred E. Smith to the Presidency. If he is elected President, you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton made the school boards plural; Slayton only mentioned one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Slayton if he had an image of the note. He didn&rsquo;t, although he said the anecdote might have come from a 1932 book <em>The Shadow of the Pope&nbsp;</em>by&nbsp;Michael Williams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We tracked down the book in the stacks at the Georgetown University library. Williams described something appreciably different from what Clinton and Slayton had said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams&nbsp;wrote about a Sunday school --&nbsp;a class held on Sundays to teach about religion --, not a public school board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;On September 16, 1928, a Sunday school in Daytona Beach, Fla., (said the <em>Daytona Times</em>), was reported as acquiescing in a plan whereby the children were handed cards and told to pass them on the their mothers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is stated that the cards declared: &lsquo;We must prevent the election of Alfred E. Smith to the Presidency. If he is chosen President, you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Daytona.jpg\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oMulJodoIr2_bsCh2nJPcoHKGxHiYxHi_klKSNz0LyrZQD0UNY0ibXpJH2ZCLoiS9je9LIF8m52LuPdmmWzTQgXXgXmP3rk7jEyQY4GXv0F76cAkwTrlQnwKXU7NiA6EQZ6PV1jO\" style=\"border:none; height:263px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williams went on to write that this plan &quot;is reported to have originated in St. Paul, Minn., and to have been used in other places.&quot; So it&rsquo;s possible that other Sunday schools did this, but we don&rsquo;t really know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve tried without luck to find the <em>Daytona Times</em> report. If anyone reading this is able to find the article, or find an example from St. Paul, we welcome the help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton said that in 1928, school boards sent kids home with a note warning that if Al Smith were elected president, they would not be allowed to own or read a Bible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It appears that reference tracks back to a 1932 book, and a newspaper article before that, that spoke of a Sunday school in Daytona Beach passing out a note. There is a chance that other Sunday schools in other states did likewise, but we don&rsquo;t have proof of that. There is a big difference between a Sunday school and a public school.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anti-Catholic sentiment Clinton talked about was real and there&rsquo;s credible evidence that the note she described went home with some children. But her statement is only partially accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Half True.</p> <a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fd009790-f44c-49a8-909f-e659f86df74b\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fd009790-f44c-49a8-909f-e659f86df74b</a>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-24T15:06:05.067266", "ruling_date": "2016-10-24T16:23:41", "ruling_headline": "Clinton: School boards' anti-Catholic scare tactics in 1928 election", "ruling_headline_slug": "clinton-school-boards-anti-catholic-scare-tactics-", "ruling_link_text": "A leap of faith", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>C-SPAN, <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4627131/clinton-al-smith-anti-catholicism\">Hillary Clinton at Alfred E.
