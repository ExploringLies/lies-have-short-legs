American Crossroads is a conservative, Republican-backed political advocacy group that&#39;s launched ads against Democrats around the country. Some are calling the group a &quot;SuperPAC&quot; (PAC stands for political action committee) because of its fund-raising prowess and national reach.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfH-pFqe9CU\" id=\"y5jj\" title=\"ad against Hodes\">ad against Hodes</a> features a hot dog cart and carnival music. Here&#39;s what the ad says:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In New Hampshire, Congressman Hodes claims, &#39;You deserve a senator who&#39;s a real fiscal conservative... and who gets rid of the pork.&#39; But Hodes voted for the pork-filled stimulus bill -- $1.9 million to study ants in Africa, $39 million for office upgrades for politicians. Billions wasted and unemployment still higher. No wonder the Union Leader says &#39;The guy just can&#39;t tell the truth.&#39;&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wanted to check whether the stimulus had &quot;$1.9 million to study ants&quot; in Africa and &quot;$39 million for office upgardes for politicians.&quot; Both projects are on a list of stimulus projects put together by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that American Crossroads pointed us to. The list included&nbsp; &quot;<a href=\"http://coburn.senate.gov/public//index.cfm?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=e1e0624e-d02a-42d4-9dbb-f5b9f21b3572\">100 stimulus projects that give taxpayers the blues</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&#39;s start with the ants. Several candidates have been facing this line of attack <font>over </font>their votes in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the economic stimulus. Our colleagues at <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2010/sep/24/jim-huffman/jim-huffman-attacks-ron-wyden-spending-2-million-s/\" id=\"vp1f\" title=\"PolitiFact Oregon\">PolitiFact Oregon</a> looked at the charge made against Sen. Ron Wyden, Oregon&#39;s Democratic incumbent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked Hodes&#39; voting record and found that he did indeed vote for the stimulus bill.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the stimulus didn&#39;t release money for ant research directly, and you won&#39;t find a &quot;study of ants&quot; in the bill&#39;s text.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInstead, the federal stimulus gave $3 billion to the National Science Foundation, which otherwise had a budget of about $6.5 billion in 2009. The foundation is an independent federal agency devoted to the progress of science. It distributed the stimulus money using the same peer-review process that it normally uses to decide which scientific research deserves funding.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere, it&#39;s best to quote from PolitiFact Oregon&#39;s report:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;As it turns out, one scientist&#39;s study on <a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0842395\">ants of the Southwest Indian Ocean and East Africa</a> made the cut. PolitiFact Oregon caught up with Brian Fisher, the project&#39;s leader and curator of entomology at the California Academy of Sciences, to pick his brain about the recent political celebrity of ants. He was, maybe surprisingly, pretty unfazed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;&#39;I think it&#39;s legitimate,&#39; he said. &#39;There&#39;s no reason why people shouldn&#39;t challenge this and question what we&#39;re doing.&#39;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What exactly are they doing? Well, over the course of the next five years, Fisher and his team will be studying arthropods -- a category that includes ants -- in a part of the world he describes as immensely diverse, biologically speaking. While ant research might not seem like an obvious target for government funds, Fisher provides a logical defense.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Ants, Fisher says, offer insight into climate change, the spread of disease and natural disasters. &#39;You can&#39;t monitor every single living thing, (but) there are key groups that can serve as indicators for other taxa, ants being one of them,&#39; he said. &#39;Without them, we wouldn&#39;t have a functioning ecosystem.&#39; (Taxa are groups of organisms.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It&#39;s also worth noting that the project has so far helped employ 16 people, at Fisher&#39;s last count.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, what about the other claim, that the stimulus spent &quot;$39 million for office upgrades for politicians&quot;?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe basis for this claim is a project in to renovate the Kansas State Capitol, a historic structure that dates to the late 1800s. A major renovation has been going on since 2000 to improve the building&#39;s wiring, plumbing, heating and air conditioning. And yes, the legislators also wanted more office space and upgraded meeting rooms, according to a 2009 <i>Associated Press</i> report. Hence &quot;office upgrades for politicians.&quot; The overall project is expected to cost upwards of $285 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe $39 million from the stimulus bill is not direct funding. Instead, it comes from a special bond program, Build America Bonds, created by the stimulus to help local governments save money on building projects.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;As a result of this federal subsidy payment, state and local governments will have lower net borrowing costs and be able to reach more sources of borrowing than with more traditional tax-exempt or tax credit bonds,&quot; said a statement on the U.S. Treasury Department website.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLast summer, state officials decided to use the program to pay for the project, and $39 million is the amount that the federal bond program subsidizes. A Kansas official said that it would save the state about $500,000 in debt service costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There&#39;s not stimulus money that&#39;s directly going to the renovation,&quot; said Amy Jordan Wooden, press secretary for Kansas Gov. Mark Parkinson. &quot;It gives us a lower interest rate than we could get on the market.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, a small bonus fact-check: We were curious about the ad&#39;s statement that &quot;the Union Leader says &#39;The guy just can&#39;t tell the truth.&#39;&quot; The newspaper&#39;s conservative editorial page did indeed say that about an attack ad Hodes launched against his opponent, former attorney general Kelly Ayotte. Our friends at Factcheck.org debunked <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2010/06/hodes-deletes-truth-in-nh-senate-race/\" id=\"lcgb\" title=\"Hodes' attack on Ayotte\">Hodes&#39; attack on Ayotte</a>, finding he was inaccurate when he suggested she had hidden e-mails that were relevant to a state investigation of an alleged Ponzi scheme. In July, the Union Leader lashed him for &quot;blatantly false attacks against his leading rival.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor our ruling, we&#39;re looking at the ad&#39;s statement that &quot; Hodes voted for the pork-filled stimulus bill -- $1.9 million to study ants in Africa, $39 million for office upgrades for politicians.&quot; It&#39;s true that Hodes voted for the bill, but at the time he had no way of knowing that those particular projects would be funded. It is a stretch to say that he voted for &quot;$1.9 million to study ants in Africa,&quot; because he voted to add $3 billion in funding for the National Science Foundation. Its explanation of &quot;$39 million for office upgrades for politicians&quot; also leaves out significant details. It&#39;s a bond program, not a direct subsidy, and the money supports a large historical renovation, not simply &quot;office upgrades for politicians.&quot; So we rate the ad&#39;s statement Barely True.</p>\r\n\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
