They have declining revenues and increasing demand. And RIPTA has really some of the fullest buses for its transit agency size around the country,&quot; he said. &quot;So it&#39;s really something that should get more attention and hopefully this is the year that the General Assembly sees fit to give RIPTA sustainable funding for the long term. There&#39;s a bill to do that and we&#39;ve been pushing on it for years.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe wondered whether RIPTA does, in fact, have some of the fullest buses around.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe called Collins. He said he was told that factoid by Mark Therrien, the authority&#39;s assistant general manager for planning.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe called Therrien. He said Collins was correct. When we asked for details, he referred us to the <a href=\"http://www.ftis.org/intdas.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Integrated National Transit Database Analysis System</a> (INTDAS) which has national statistics over many years for transit systems throughout the United States.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe database will generate a list of comparable transit systems around the country. We did that for RIPTA and decided to focus on the 30 that were closest based on a variety of measures such as size, according to the federal ranking. We also looked at six other systems -- in Eugene, Ore.; Fort Worth, Texas; Jacksonville, Fla.; Memphis, Tenn.; Louisville, Ky.; and Des Moines, Iowa -- that Therrien said were comparable as well.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut what to look at?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe database, whose most recent statistics were from 2011, doesn&#39;t include a direct measurement of how full the buses are.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe discovered there were a lot of indirect ways to estimate capacity that gave different rankings.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherrien said we should look at passengers per hour. By that measure, RIPTA ranked 8th out of 37 systems.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe also looked at the number of passenger trips divided by the number of vehicles in operation during peak hours. RIPTA ranked 9th by that measure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMeanwhile, we received an e-mail from <a href=\"http://www.cee.fiu.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/albert-gan/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Albert Gan</a>, a professor with the department of civil and environmental engineering at Florida International University, who developed the INTDAS system.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe said the correct method would be to divide the number of passenger miles in a year by the number of miles driven when the buses were picking and dropping off passengers (known as revenue miles). By that measure, RIPTA ranked 13th out of 37.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen we heard back from Therrien&#39;s office, which advised us that it was best to look at the number of passenger trips divided by the number of revenue miles. In that instance, RIPTA ranked 10th.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome other systems were pretty crowded using that yardstick. Milwaukee had 24 percent more passengers per bus than Providence; Madison had 34 percent more; Eugene had 39 percent more; and Rochester, N.Y. had 46 percent more.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo sum up, Abel Collins said, &quot;RIPTA has really some of the fullest buses for its transit agency size around the country.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Some of the fullest&quot; is a little vague, but it implies that Rhode Island is going to be up there in the rankings.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRIPTA, asked about the claim, suggested that we look at 11 transit systems. We ultimately analyzed data on more than three times that many, using a federal rating method that listed bus services comparable to Rhode Island&#39;s.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRIPTA&#39;s rankings ranged from 8th to 13th. They varied a bit because there&#39;s no standardized way to calculate who has the &quot;fullest&quot; buses.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause there&#39;s some uncertainty but the different methods show RIPTA ranking high, we rate Collins&#39; statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Mostly True</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
