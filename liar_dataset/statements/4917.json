Obama affixed a price tag of $900 billion to the plan <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32752036/ns/politics-health_care_reform/t/obama-billion-fix-health-care/#.Ttaj9eywXEo\">when he rolled out his version</a> in September 2009. Subsequent cost estimates varied. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Gingrich is suggesting a lot of fraud. But was he right that IBM presented the president with such a scheme?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy way of background, we note that Gingrich has long advocated using technology to help cut health-care costs. Until recently he led a for-profit <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/npr/143146399/gingrichs-health-care-consultancy-is-it-lobbying\">consultancy</a> called the <a href=\"http://www.healthtransformation.net/cs/news/news_detail?pressrelease.id=3999\">Center for Health Transformations</a>, which <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_18/b4129035609350.htm\">counted IBM</a> among its clients.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Gingrich&rsquo;s campaign for the former House speaker&rsquo;s basis in making the statement. Spokesman Joe DeSantis told us: &quot;All I can say is that he heard it from someone he trusts. &nbsp;Sorry.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut DeSantis directed us to video of <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/video/viewpoints-working-with-the-obama-white-house/5A0ED9CD-CFC8-4898-8ADB-B0B8196D7E5A.html\">a Sept. 14, 2010, Wall Street Journal interview of Sam Palmisano,</a> IBM&rsquo;s then-CEO and chairman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeparately, IBM spokesman Ed Barbini also referred us to the Journal interview. He declined further comment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe video opens with the Journal&rsquo;s Alan Murray saying: &quot;When President Obama was elected, you started spending a fair amount of time at the White House.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPalmisano: &quot;Yes, I did.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMurray: &quot;What was that all about?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Well,&quot; Palmisano replied, &quot;part of it was the administration was reaching out to the business community. I mean, I was one of many, obviously ... around economic (issues)... So we were having lots of input, lots of exchange. That&rsquo;s what we all were working on at the time.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked how he thought the White House visits had turned out, Palmisano replied: &quot;We haven&rsquo;t made any progress. It doesn&rsquo;t mean there hasn&rsquo;t been a lot of interaction.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMurray: &quot;Well, what&rsquo;s the point of interaction if it doesn&rsquo;t lead to progress?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPalmisano: &quot;You&rsquo;d have to ask the people who aren&rsquo;t progressing.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe added, &quot;We&rsquo;ve done tons of work, and for whatever sets of reasons, we haven&rsquo;t been able to establish, be in sync with, the priorities.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPalmisano offered an example: &quot;We -- and I&rsquo;m fairly confident about this one because it required no legislative change -- we could have improved quality and reduced the costs of the health-care system by $900 billion... It was self-funding. You could have insured anybody you wanted to, illegal aliens, dogs, cats, ponies, whatever, right? And the stuff was simple. Did not require any big legislative change.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAbout $400 billion of the reduced costs could be realized through negotiating discounts with drug companies, just as IBM negotiates its own discounts, he said. &quot;Buy a nationwide discount,&quot; he said. &quot;Just like pharmaceutical companies sell to us on a nationwide discount. It&rsquo;s no different. I said, &lsquo;Take the IBM discount! Take the IBM discount.&rsquo; &quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnother example of savings: &quot;Two hundred billion in fraud. That was a 3 percent improvement, by the way. This wasn&rsquo;t transformational. ... There&rsquo;s so much fraud in the system -- 3 percent and then Year 7 was 8 percent, Year 5 was 5 percent. It&rsquo;s 200 billion.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMurray: &quot;And why didn&rsquo;t they do that? Is there a fraud --&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPalmisano: &quot;I said we would do it for free to prove that it works. They turned us down. You&rsquo;ll have to ask them&hellip; Free. Free wasn&rsquo;t good enough.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMurray asks again: Why?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPalmisano replies, &quot;I think what it is, not to be judgmental about these things, I really do think what it is is that we weren&#39;t aligning with the priorities. ... the priority at the time, if I stay on my example of health care, was not to reduce costs and improve quality. &nbsp;It was to provide insurance and coverage for more people. &nbsp;That was our priority in the line. &nbsp;All we said, if you did this you could fund the priority without increasing the deficit, taking taxes up. &nbsp;And we couldn&#39;t sell the case.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s take a breath here. In the Journal interview, Palmisano insisted he gave the White House an offer to cover the $900 billion estimated cost of the health care plan -- with $200 billion coming from reduced fraud.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe were unable to find independent confirmation of such an offer -- and our search of news archives indicates the CEO&rsquo;s comments to the Journal touched off only one follow-up news account. Nearly a month after the interview, on the Oct. 8, 2010, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/your-world-cavuto/transcript/ibm-ceo-administration-turned-down-free-offer-hunt-out-health-care-abuse\">episode</a> of a Fox News program, guest host Stuart Varney said that an IBM spokesman stood by Palmisano&rsquo;s claims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat program aired shortly after a more widely publicized event: On Oct. 6, 2010, Palmisano led a group of high-tech CEOs to the White House to <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/tech-chiefs-present-a-deficit-reduction-plan/\">present</a> Obama with <a href=\"http://www.techceocouncil.org/news/2010/10/01/reports/one_trillion_reasons/\">a proposal</a> they said could save the government $1 trillion by 2020.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmong the plan&rsquo;s seven initiatives: saving $500 billion by streamlining supply chains and pushing suppliers to reduce costs; and saving $200 billion by using technology to better detect &quot;improper payments&quot; -- payments that prove to be unnecessary or fraudulent. The proposal cites an Office of Management and Budget estimate that Medicare accounted for $54 billion of the government&rsquo;s $98 billion in improper payments in 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy email, White House spokesman Brandon Lepow did not provide information confirming or denying Palmisano&rsquo;s claims to the Journal about presenting savings ideas. Lepow initially said companies including IBM had offered the administration help fighting fraud. He later told us he had learned his first statement was inaccurate. His follow-up statement said the administration and IBM had worked on &quot;possible projects&quot; but agreed not to &quot;move forward,&quot; although IBM is a partner in &quot;our work to fight fraud.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur ruling<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGingrich did not reveal the source of his claim or provide backup beyond the Journal interview. Meantime, the White House did not confirm or deny Palmisano&rsquo;s claims. Contrary to Gingrich&rsquo;s debate claim, though, the then-CEO said $200 billion in funding would come from cutting fraud -- not nearly enough to pay for the health-care overhaul. We rate Gingrich&rsquo;s statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-12-08T20:25:11.931501", "ruling_date": "2011-12-09T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Gingrich says IBM made Obama an offer to save billions on health care", "ruling_headline_slug": "gingrich-says-ibm-made-obama-offer", "ruling_link_text": "White House didn't confirm or deny", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tC-SPAN video, <a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/CainNew/start/2052/stop/2463\">&quot;Herman Cain-Newt Gingrich Lincoln-Douglas Style Debate,&quot;</a> Nov. 5, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMSNBC.com news story, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32752036/ns/politics-health_care_reform/t/obama-billion-fix-health-care/#.TuFbfuywXEp\">&quot;Obama: $900 billion to fix health care,&quot;</a> by M.
