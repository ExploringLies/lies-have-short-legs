Minority Leader Richard Saslaw has spearheaded the opposition this winter to Gov. Bob McDonnell&rsquo;s plan to raise transportation revenues by abolishing the state gas tax and replacing it with a sales tax increase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSaslaw, D-Fairfax, says the only way to raise ample money for roads is to increase both the sales and the gas tax. He introduced an unsuccessful bill that would have raised Virginia&rsquo;s 5 percent sales tax to 6 percent. It also would have increased the state&rsquo;s 17.5-cent a gallon gas excise tax by 5 cents a gallon during each of the next two years and set the levy to automatically rise at the inflation rate of construction costs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMcDonnell says that the gas tax is outdated and will produce declining revenues in the future as cars become more fuel efficient. Saslaw says the problems with Virginia&rsquo;s flat gas tax are that it&rsquo;s not indexed to inflation and has not been increased since 1987. That&rsquo;s a far cry from other states, he claims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There&rsquo;s a reason the other 49 states keep raising their gas tax,&quot; Saslaw during a Jan. 15 news conference called by the Senate Democratic Caucus to lay out its positions on key issues, including transportation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe repeated the statement at the end of the news conference. &quot;Everybody, all the other states, raise their gas tax except Virginia,&quot; Saslaw said. &quot;Naturally, your gas tax isn&rsquo;t going to grow.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we contacted Saslaw, he said he may have misspoken. The senator said he was trying to make a point that, with few exceptions, other states have raised their gasoline excise tax since Virginia&rsquo;s rate went into effect 26 years ago.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I don&rsquo;t know of a state that hasn&rsquo;t raised their gas tax since 1986,&quot; Saslaw told us. &quot;Some of them, they&rsquo;ve gone up quite a few times.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSaslaw, who&#39;s been in the General Assembly since 1976, acknowledged he could have worded his original statement better, saying perhaps he shouldn&rsquo;t have said all the other states &quot;keep&quot; raising their gas taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMost states do not routinely raise their gas taxes, we learned after consulting a September 2012 <a href=\"http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/motorfuel/sep12/sep12.pdf\">report</a> by the Federal Highway Administration and a December 2011 <a href=\"http://www.itep.org/bettergastax/\">study</a> by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExcise gas taxes regularly increase in 14 states. That&rsquo;s because they have variables in their tax rates that periodically rise with inflation or the price of gas.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf the remaining 36 states with flat rates, 25 have not increased their excise tax in 10 years of more. And 14 of those states -- including Virginia -- have not raised the levy in 20 years or more.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVirginia&rsquo;s gas tax rate, which went into effect on Jan. 1, 1987, is the second oldest in the nation. It bows only to Alaska, which implemented its 8-cent gas tax in 1970, although it was <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/2009/08/31/917489/state-gasoline-tax-resumes-today.html\">suspended </a>for a year in 2008.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVirginia&rsquo;s 26-year-old tax has a peer group, however. South Carolina&rsquo;s 16-cent per gallon tax went into effect in July 1987. Oklahoma&rsquo;s 17 cent rate was established in May 1987. New Jersey&rsquo;s 10.5-cent tax went into effect in July 1988 while Tennessee&rsquo;s 20-cent levy went into effect in July 1989.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSaslaw said the 49 other states keep raising their gas tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwenty-five states have not raised their gas tax in a decade or more, and 14 of those states -- including Virginia -- have gone at least two decades without an increase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSaslaw offers no proof for his claim and acknowledges he may have misspoken. His statement is wrong, without basis and we give it our lowest rating, Pants on Fire.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-02-10T13:19:36.155181", "ruling_date": "2013-02-11T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Dick Saslaw says all states, except Virginia, \"keep raising their gas tax\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "dick-saslaw-say-except-virginia-all-states-keep-ra", "ruling_link_text": "Fueless statement", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tSen.
