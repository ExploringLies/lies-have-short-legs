Republicans control the House of Delegates and have eliminated the district of Minority Leader Ward Armstrong, D-Henry. Democrats control the Senate and are drawing four Republican incumbents into two districts.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSenate Minority Leader Thomas K. Norment, Jr., R-James City, was especially upset with the Democratic proposal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Senate Democrats have crafted an outrageously partisan redistricting plan that will go down as one of the most notorious examples of gerrymandering in history,&quot; Norment said in a press release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Senate plan, drawn primarily by Sen. Janet D. Howell, D-Fairfax, would squeeze GOP Sens. Frank W. Wagner and Jeff McWaters, both of Virginia Beach, into the same district. It also would lump Sen. Stephen D. Newman, R-Lynchburg, into the same district as Sen. Ralph K. Smith, R-Botetourt County.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTen years ago, when Norment was Senate majority leader, he did the same thing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith Republicans holding 22 seats to the Democrats&rsquo; 18, the Senate drew election maps, Norment&rsquo;s party cramped Sen. Mary Margaret Whipple, D-Arlington, into the same district as Sen. Leslie L. Byrne, D-Fairfax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSen. Madison E. Marye, D-Montgomery, was grouped with Sen. Malfourd &quot;Bo&quot; Trumbo, R-Botetourt, with the Marye&rsquo;s seat moving to Northern Virginia. &nbsp;The moves created a pair of GOP-leaning open seats, designed for and won by Republicans who were then serving in the House of Delegates.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe gerrymandering left Byrne furious and complaining that Republicans were unfairly singling out Democratic women. Norment was unsympathetic, sarcastically replying that &quot;subtlety is lost&quot; on the Democrat.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe next day, Norment said the 2001 map was far less extreme than those drawn in 1991, when Democrats held the Senate. Norment said redistricting is &quot;a political process.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNorment isn&rsquo;t the only senator to change his redistricting tune. Ten years ago Howell called the GOP&rsquo;s Senate &nbsp;plan &quot;absurd.&quot; On April 5, she said the &nbsp;2011 map she drew for the Democratic majority followed the same principles as the 2001 GOP plan, including the use of a 2 percent population deviation for districts. Howell also noted that her plan splits 43 localities into different districts, quite similar to the 41 cleaved in the 2001 map.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNorment now complains that Senate Democrats are pushing &quot;one of the most notorious examples of gerrymandering in history.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut to our eyes, Howell&rsquo;s plan uses many of the same criteria Norment endorsed 10 years ago. &nbsp;Just as two Democrats stood to lose their seats in 2001, two Republicans are out of luck in 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNorment has done a Full Flop!&nbsp;</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-04-07T18:07:32.310281", "ruling_date": "2011-04-08T11:37:01", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
