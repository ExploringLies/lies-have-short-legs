But the deficit grew quickly under Obama: The fiscal 2009 deficit rose to $1.41 trillion and has remained above $1 trillion annually ever since.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut compared to what Obama inherited, the annual deficit has gone down slightly. CBO projects that for fiscal 2012, which has just ended, the fiscal 2012 deficit will be $1.09 trillion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, far from doubling the deficit, Obama (along with, it should be noted, some Republican help in Congress) has instead reduced the deficit by about 8 percent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe only way to get to doubling is to use a different starting point, which is what the Romney campaign does. His campaign compares the current deficit to the final fiscal 2008 deficit of $458.6 billion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut we don&#39;t find that to be the correct starting point.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRomney was referring to a statement Obama made on Feb. 23, 2009, so the correct comparison would be the deficit at that point. The 2008 deficit covered a fiscal year that ended about four months before Obama took office -- and which was also a period of rapid economic deterioration that affected the scale of CBO&rsquo;s deficit projections. So CBO&rsquo;s January 2009 figure offers a much more accurate indication of what Obama &quot;inherited&quot; -- which, we should repeat, is the word Obama used in his broken promise of February 2009.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRomney would still have been off if he had said the federal debt, rather than deficit, had doubled on Obama&rsquo;s watch. The debt held by the public -- one of two key measures of federal debt -- rose from $6.3 trillion on Jan. 20, 2009, to $11.3 trillion on the day of the debate, an increase of 79 percent. The total federal debt, which includes debt the government holds itself, rose by a smaller amount over that period, 53 percent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nRomney said that Obama has &quot;doubled&quot; the deficit. In reality, using the most appropriate comparison, he and Congress have actually decreased the deficit slightly. We rate Romney&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<script src=\"http://www.politifact.com/media/js/politifactwidget5.js\"></script>", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-05T15:44:11.337596", "ruling_date": "2012-10-05T16:37:08", "ruling_headline": "Mitt Romney says Barack Obama has 'doubled' the deficit", "ruling_headline_slug": "mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-has-doubled-deficit", "ruling_link_text": "The deficit is actually down slightly from what Obama inherited", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Mitt Romney, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/2012-presidential-debate-president-obama-and-mitt-romneys-remarks-in-denver-on-oct-3-running-transcript/2012/10/03/24d6eb6e-0d91-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_story_4.html\">transcript of first presidential debate in Denver</a>, Oct. 3, 2012<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOffice of Management and Budget, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist01z1.xls\">Table 1.1&mdash;Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-): 1789&ndash;2017</a>,&quot;
