Robert Menendez sought to put a number on President Barack Obama&rsquo;s record on the economy: 5 million new jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt an Oct. 27 campaign rally in Monmouth County, the senator claimed, &quot;this president has taken us from the abyss and from losing millions of jobs under Bush to having made 5 million jobs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTwo days before voters headed to the polls, Menendez repeated the line at a Nov. 4 rally in Burlington County. Under Obama, the United States &quot;went from losing millions of jobs to creating 5 million jobs,&quot; Menendez told the crowd.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFive million new jobs? Well, it depends when you start counting and what types of jobs you&rsquo;re talking about.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur PolitiFact colleagues issued a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/17/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-his-administration-has-created-5/\">Half True ruling</a> in October on a similar claim by Obama, who said his administration has created 5 million jobs &quot;over the last 30 months in the private sector alone.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLike Obama&rsquo;s statement, Menendez&rsquo;s claim is accurate only when you consider the net increase of nearly 5 million private-sector jobs since February 2010, the low point in the private-sector job market.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen you pull the yardstick back to different points during the first year of Obama&#39;s presidency, private-sector job growth has been less than what Menendez claimed. Also, in terms of total jobs, those private-sector gains have been offset by losses in the public-sector.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA spokeswoman for Menendez declined to comment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s break down the numbers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs the end point for our analyses, we&rsquo;re using the preliminary figures for October 2012, the latest jobs data available at the time of Menendez&rsquo;s most recent statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBetween February 2010 and October 2012, Obama presided over the net creation of just under 5 million private-sector jobs, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the story changes slightly when you factor in the loss of public-sector jobs. Then, the net increase in total jobs has been about 4.5 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, starting at February 2010 represents cherry-picking a time frame that provides the best possible outlook on job growth.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s see what happens when we measure job growth from three separate starting points during Obama&#39;s first year in office: January 2009, when Obama was sworn in; February 2009, his first full month in office; and June 2009, the official beginning of the recovery, as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn short, those starting points show there&rsquo;s been less job growth than Menendez claimed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince January 2009, there&rsquo;s been a net increase of 759,000 private-sector jobs. But given public-sector job losses, the net increase in total jobs has been 194,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince February 2009, the nation has gained 1,484,000 private-sector jobs and lost 566,000 public-sector jobs, leaving it with a net increase of 918,000 total jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStart at June 2009, and the net increase in private-sector jobs has been roughly 3.8 million. The net gain in total jobs lands at about 3.2 million, however, when factoring in the loss of 559,000 public-sector jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne last note: experts have said that presidents have a limited impact on employment changes. So, it&rsquo;s not appropriate to give Obama too much credit for job growth or too much blame for job losses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt two campaign rallies leading up to the election, Menendez claimed that under Obama, the United States has created &quot;five million jobs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s only true if you&rsquo;re talking about private-sector job growth since February 2010. When you factor in public-sector job losses and start counting at different points during Obama&rsquo;s first year in office, the employment picture is far from what Menendez claimed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/11/politifact_nj_sen_menendez_say_1.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-11-08T17:51:52.077985", "ruling_date": "2012-11-12T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Sen.
