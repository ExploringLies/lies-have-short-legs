(<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=6jJvkkNmR_8\">Watch more</a> of his remarks that day.) He said then that the nation&rsquo;s $1.3 trillion deficit was the largest in the nation&rsquo;s history. It was mostly unchanged through fiscal year 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2012? It&rsquo;s expected to be $1.17 trillion.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo not cut in half. That&rsquo;s according to the nonpartisan researchers at the Congressional Budget Office in a <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/March2012Baseline.pdf\">March 2012 report</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Although the deficit is starting to shrink, it remains very large by historical standards,&quot; the CBO noted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact Florida asked the Obama campaign about the pledge as part of a fact-check along the same lines from Republican Party of Florida chairman Lenny Curry. The campaign pointed us to Obama&rsquo;s response when asked about it by an Atlanta TV station in February 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Well, we&#39;re not there because this recession turned out to be a lot deeper than any of us realized,&quot; he said. &quot;Everybody who is out there back in 2009, if you look back at what their estimates were in terms of how many jobs had been lost, how bad the economy had contracted when I took office, everybody underestimated it. &hellip;&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama promised to halve the nation&rsquo;s deficit, but he hasn&rsquo;t managed to chip away much as the end of his first term nears.
