As a veteran prosecutor who has spent her entire career upholding the laws of this state, I have the training and experience necessary to successfully defend our laws in a courtroom.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChecking back on newspaper reports of earlier candidate forums and events featuring Bondi, it&rsquo;s worth noting that earlier in her campaign, she was vague in outright declaring a position.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDuring a June 4&nbsp;forum in St. Petersburg, when asked about upholding McCollum&rsquo;s challenge, both Benson and Kottkamp said they would. Bondi said, &quot;Our judiciary will make a fair and just decision regarding that case.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEarlier, at a May 18 appearance in Miami Lakes, Bondi was quoted by the <em>St. Petersburg Times</em> as mentioning two gay friends and noting that the adoption process needed reform. &quot;I have friends in Tampa who are in law enforcement who have adopted from overseas, who are in a loving, committed same-sex relationship.&quot; Still, calling for an overhaul of the adoption process and clearly specifying whether or not gays should be entitled to adoption are two different things.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBondi, a legal analyst for Fox News, began to clarify her support for the gay adoption ban in subsequent forums and newspaper interviews.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen asked by the <em>St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald</em> in a June 5 interview whether she would follow through on McCollum&rsquo;s appeal<strong>,</strong> she responded: &quot;I will continue with General McCollum&rsquo;s appeal. If [the Supreme Court] can legally hear it, yes, I will appeal.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt an Aug. 7 forum sponsored by the Christian Family Coalition, Bondi pledged to oppose gay adoption.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBondi campaign spokesman Kim Kirtley also pointed to interviews with the editorial boards of the <em>St. Petersburg Times </em>on July 14 and the<em> Sun-Sentinel</em> on Aug. 10 where she was asked about her position on gay adoption and she stated her support for the ban. Both papers have handed Bondi an endorsement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo back to the question. Did Bondi &quot;refuse to take a position on banning gay adoptions&quot;? No. She hedged at first, but she&rsquo;s made it clear&nbsp;since then that she will pursue the appeal and opposes gay adoption. Therefore we rate his claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-08-16T18:54:31.535565", "ruling_date": "2010-08-17T15:23:38", "ruling_headline": "Attorney General candidate Pam Bondi's stance on gay adoption under attack by social conservative", "ruling_headline_slug": "ag-candidate-pam-bondis-stance-gay-adoption-under-", "ruling_link_text": "Bondi pledges to oppose gay adoption", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tSt. Petersburg Times, &quot;The Buzz&quot;
