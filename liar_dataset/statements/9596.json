Donna Edwards, D-Md., cited strong Republican approval for the law on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUrAR14ISxk\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>July 13, 2014, edition</u></a> of CNN&rsquo;s <em>State of the Union</em>. It came during a roundtable discussion of frayed partisan relations in Congress, including House Speaker John Boehner&rsquo;s effort to sue Obama over his administration&rsquo;s alleged overreach on implementation of the health care law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Edwards <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1407/13/sotu.01.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>said</u></a>, &quot;I don&#39;t understand the politics (of the lawsuit), quite frankly. I mean, 74 percent of Republicans support the Affordable Care Act. And so they&#39;re suing against their own Republicans.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to take a closer look at whether 74 percent of Republicans really &quot;support the Affordable Care Act.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started by checking with Edwards&rsquo; office. Spokesman Benjamin Gerdes said Edwards was referring to a <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/issue-brief/2014/jul/1760_collins_gaining_ground_tracking_survey.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>poll</u></a> by the Commonwealth Fund, a think tank that <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthfund.org/about-us\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>supports</u></a> &quot;better access, improved quality, and greater efficiency&quot; in health care, &quot;particularly for society&#39;s most vulnerable.&quot; The poll reached 4,425 adults by telephone between April 9 and June 2, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pollsters interviewed a sample of adults between 19 and 64 who had selected a private plan or enrolled in Medicaid due to provisions in the Affordable Care Act, or who have had Medicaid for less than 1 year. One of the questions was, &quot;Overall, how satisfied are you with this new health insurance?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The poll found that 74 percent of the Republicans who had signed up for health coverage at least in part due to the ACA said they were satisfied -- specifically, 30 percent somewhat satisfied and 44 percent very satisfied. That satisfaction rate was rate slightly lower than it was for Democrats (85 percent) and Independents (82 percent), but still overwhelmingly high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a notable finding, suggesting, essentially, that if you try the ACA, you&rsquo;ll like the ACA -- even if you&rsquo;re a Republican.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Edwards didn&rsquo;t say that 74 percent of Republicans who signed up for coverage as a result of ACA said they were satisfied with the coverage they got. Instead, she said, &quot;74 percent of Republicans support the Affordable Care Act&quot; -- a much broader assertion, and one that&rsquo;s undercut by a host of survey data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, here are three recent polls:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Quinnipiac Poll</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/search-releases/search-results/release-detail?What=&amp;strArea=6;&amp;strTime=3&amp;ReleaseID=2056#Question021\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>June 24-30</u></a>: &quot;Do you support or oppose the health care law passed by Barack Obama and Congress in 2010?&quot; <strong>Republicans: 9 percent support, 90 percent oppose.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll</strong>, <a href=\"http://kff.org/interactive/health-tracking-poll-exploring-the-publics-views-on-the-affordable-care-act-aca/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>June 12-18</u></a>: &quot;As you may know, a health reform bill was signed into law in 2010. Given what you know about the health reform law, do you have a generally favorable or generally unfavorable opinion of it?&quot; <strong>Republicans: 15 percent support, 74 percent oppose.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Gallup</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/170750/despite-enrollment-success-healthcare-law-remains-unpopular.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>May 21-25</u></a>. &quot;Do you generally approve or disapprove of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Obama that restructured the U.S. health care system?&quot; <strong>Republicans: 8 percent support. </strong>(Figures for &quot;oppose&quot; were not posted.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, support for the law among Democrats ranged between 66 percent and 83 percent in these polls -- a yawning partisan gap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we got back in touch with Gerdes, he acknowledged that Edwards &quot;did misspeak.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Edwards said that &quot;74 percent of Republicans support the Affordable Care Act.&quot; She actually has a reasonable point to make -- that, contrary to the popular impression of the law, most Republicans who have signed up for insurance through the law say they are satisfied with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, that&rsquo;s not how Edwards phrased the claim on CNN. On the broader question of whether Republicans &quot;support the Affordable Care Act,&quot; the results in recent polls have ranged from 8 percent and 15 percent -- far lower than the 74 percent a viewer would be led to believe from watching Edwards during the roundtable segment. We rate her claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-07-14T14:47:41.559398", "ruling_date": "2014-07-14T17:32:55", "ruling_headline": "Democratic Rep.
