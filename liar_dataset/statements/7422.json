Do you agree?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMarkowitz had <a href=\"http://www.brooklyn-usa.org/Press/2012/oct31_MA.htm\">called on the governor</a> to &quot;allocate as many troops as possible&quot; to help the city&rsquo;s &quot;brave &mdash; but overwhelmed &mdash; first responders.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There have been unfortunate incidents of looting in some locations,&quot; said Markowitz&rsquo;s statement, published the day of Bloomberg&rsquo;s news conference. &quot;All of our resources have been stretched to the limit, but in the name of public safety we need to send more National Guard personnel into Coney Island, Manhattan Beach, Gerritsen Beach, Red Hook and any other locations the governor deems appropriate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBloomberg, who could formally request such help from the governor, disagreed. New York City didn&rsquo;t need the help, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s what he told the reporter who asked about Markowitz&rsquo;s National Guard request:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em> &quot;No, we appreciate the help. The National Guard has been helpful, but the NYPD is the only people we want on the street with guns, and we don&#39;t need it. There has been one or two minor outbreakings, disgraceful though they may be, of looting reported in the paper, but the vast bulk of people are doing the right thing. And in Brooklyn people are safe the same way as they are in the rest of the city. We have the resources. The NYPD is 100 percent confident that we can protect the public. We&#39;ve been doing this for an awful long time. You just have to take a look at the crime rate to understand how good a job this is. And the National Guard has plenty of responsibilities. There are plenty of locations upstate and into surrounding states where they don&#39;t have a police department the size of New York, and they can use help from the state, and that&#39;s where they should be.&quot;</em><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut even though the full context of his remarks indicates his reason was that the NYPD didn&#39;t need the help, the media pounced on his gun reference.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe NRA pointed us to a snippet from the <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2012/10/bloomberg-about-give-transportation-briefing/58553/\">Atlantic Wire</a>, which covered the briefing live: &quot;3:19 p.m. &lsquo;The NYPD is the only people we want on the street with guns,&rsquo; Bloomberg says when asked if he asked for National Guard help in Brooklyn.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe NRA also noted that the next day, the <em><a href=\"http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/35/44/all_martysnubbed_2012_11_02_bk.html\">Brooklyn Paper</a></em> wrote that Bloomberg &quot;snubbed Borough President Markowitz&rsquo;s impassioned plea to bring the National Guard to Hurricane Sandy-scarred Brooklyn &mdash; arguing that approving the Beep&rsquo;s request would be a waste of federal manpower and turn the borough into a police state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tConservative media picked up the story from there:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; NewsBusters: &quot;<a href=\"http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tom-blumer/2012/11/03/thursday-report-bloomberg-wouldnt-let-guard-brooklyn-over-their-possessi\">Thursday Report: Bloomberg Wouldn&#39;t Let Guard Into Brooklyn Over Their Possession of Guns</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Fox Nation: &quot;<a href=\"http://nation.foxnews.com/bloomberg/2012/11/03/report-bloomberg-denied-national-guard-assistance-brooklyn-because-their-possession-guns\">Report: Bloomberg Denied National Guard Assistance In Brooklyn Because Of Their Possession Of Guns</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Hot Air: &quot;<a href=\"http://hotair.com/archives/2012/11/04/bloomberg-kept-national-guard-out-of-nyc-because-they-had-guns/\">Bloomberg kept National Guard out of NYC because they had guns?</a>&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&bull; Breitbart: &quot;<a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/11/04/NYC-Mayor-Bloomberg-To-Brooklyn-National-Guard-Not-Allowed-With-Guns\">BLOOMBERG TO BROOKLYN: NATIONAL GUARD NOT ALLOWED WITH GUNS</a>.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid Bloomberg refuse to allow the National Guard into the city?
