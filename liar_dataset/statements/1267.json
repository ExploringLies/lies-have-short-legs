Leaders of the majority party often boast about bipartisan support when in fact they have only a handful of votes from the minority. But in this case, Obama so far has just one Republican in the Senate.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senate Finance Committee voted to approve a version of the health care overhaul on a vote of 14-9 on Oct. 13. Sen. Olympia Snowe, a Republican from Maine, voted with the Democrats. Every other Republican on the committee opposed the measure.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican member on the committee, called the measure partisan and deeply flawed.\n</p>\n<p>\n So Obama is technically correct that the proposal had \"Democratic and Republican support.\" But he didn't mention that it got only one Republican vote, which meant the nine other GOP senators voted against it. That's not exactly a robust example of bipartisanship. So we rate his statement Barely True.\n</p>\n\n<br/><br/><i>Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.
