Abele&rsquo;s 2014 budget proposal is awaiting action by the County Board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First stop, the county&rsquo;s capital budget book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book contains the official numbers on capital improvements, which in the Parks Department include things such as fixing leaky pools, building new picnic shelters, paving parkways, replacing walkways and other major work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Going back 10 years puts you at 2004, two years into Walker&rsquo;s tenure as county executive. We found four years with higher budgeted totals than 2013 -- all predating Abele.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is one wrinkle: Under Walker, the county doubled up its borrowing for capital improvements in 2009 and 2010 -- in effect borrowing for four years, including 2011 and 2012 too. That was so it could get federal subsidies to lower its normal borrowing costs, under President Barack Obama&rsquo;s economic stimulus plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adjusting for that by spreading that over four years, we actually found six years in the decade with a higher parks capital budget than 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Another way to look at it</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Abele spokesman Brendan Conway for backup on the exec&rsquo;s claim, he provided a 2013 parks capital budget figure that was more than double the amount in the budget book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conway said it included parks-related projects and major maintenance that is spread around the county budget but not tallied under parks capital because other departments supervise the work. For example: Road construction on a county parkway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abele&rsquo;s not the first county executive to pull together the numbers that way. In fact, county finance officials told us it&rsquo;s a legitimate alternative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the list itself was a bit too broad. It included, for instance, a tally for countywide sanitary sewer repairs ordered by the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, Conway didn&rsquo;t provide any prior years for comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we asked the county official in charge of capital finance, Pamela Bryant, to use Abele&rsquo;s method to generate a decade&rsquo;s worth of numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryant works for the independently elected county comptroller, Scott Manske. Before running her analysis, she conferred with Abele&rsquo;s office and they came to an agreement on what to include using the broader method, Bryant told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryant developed two tables that dealt with the &quot;double borrowing&quot; issue in different ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one table, 2007 and 2010 parks-related capital spending outpaced 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the other, there were three years in which parks-related capital spending was higher than in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t close in two instances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011 (Walker&rsquo;s last budget) and 2012, the spending was about $4 million to $7 million higher than the $14.8 million in 2013. As we mentioned, that was the first budget over which Abele had total control over capital spending due to the stimulus-related borrowing for 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the 2007 budget was just a shade over Abele&rsquo;s 2013 mark, though if inflation were factored in, the gap would grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abele told Rotarians that Milwaukee County has a &quot;parks capital budget that&rsquo;s bigger than it&rsquo;s been in the last 10 years.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By any measure, this claim misses the mark. While Abele&rsquo;s 2013 budget funded parks capital at a higher level than at least six other budgets in the decade, it&rsquo;s not close to the leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-10-22T12:26:17.993453", "ruling_date": "2013-10-23T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Chris Abele says his budget for improvements in county parks is biggest in a decade", "ruling_headline_slug": "chris-abele-says-his-budget-improvements-county-pa", "ruling_link_text": "Higher under predecessor", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Wisconsin Eye, <a href=\"http://www.wiseye.org/videoplayer/vp.html?sid=10635\">video archive,</a> Rotary Club of Milwaukee luncheon with Chris Abele, Oct. 1, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Pamela Bryant, capital finance manager, Milwaukee County, Oct. 17, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Brendan Conway, spokesman, County Executive Chris Abele, Oct. 17, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Jim Keegan, budget director, county Parks Department, Oct. 17, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee County Adopted Budget, <a href=\"http://county.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/User/bpariseau/2013-Capital-Improvements/2013AdoptedCapitalRevised12220.pdf\">2013 Capital Improvements,</a> September 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milwaukee County Fiscal Affairs Division, <a href=\"http://county.milwaukee.gov/FiscalAffairs7904.htm\">archive</a> of county capital budgets, accessed October 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "Philanthropist", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Chris", "half_true_count": 5, "home_state": "", "id": 959, "last_name": "Abele", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "chris-abele", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Abele_Chris_PFACT_2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/959/", "total_count": 22, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://chrisabele.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Milwaukee County has &quot;a parks capital budget that&rsquo;s bigger than it&rsquo;s been in the last 10 years.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech", "statement_date": "2013-10-01", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 171, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/171/", "subject": "County Budget", "subject_slug": "county-budget", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/4/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 209, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/209/", "subject": "County Government", "subject_slug": "county-government", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 100, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/100/", "subject": "Recreation", "subject_slug": "recreation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
