Bill Nelson, D-Fla., for his votes on health care and the stimulus. The ad <a href=\"http://60plus.org/60-plus-challenges-outcomes-of-florida-senator-bill-nelsons-support-for-government-spending-in-new-ad/\">says</a>:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Times have been tough in Florida. Almost 1 million out of work. Businesses shutting down. Thousands of homeowners facing foreclosure. But in Washington, Bill Nelson supports President Obama&rsquo;s policies that hurt hardworking taxpayers. He voted for Obama&rsquo;s failed $800 billion stimulus, but employment still went up, and was the deciding vote for the health care law that cuts $500 billion from Medicare to pay for new government programs. Tell Bill Nelson, protect hardworking taxpayers. Stop the wasteful spending.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe ad repeats a number of charges against Obama and Democrats who supported him. For example, PolitiFact has fact-checked the claim by the U.S. Chamber that Nelson voted to cut $500 billion from Medicare and ruled it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/may/15/us-chamber-commerce/chamber-says-bill-nelson-voted-cut-medicare-500-bi/\">Mostly False</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor this report, we wanted to check if Nelson cast the &quot;deciding vote&quot; for the health care law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe claim has been made before about other Democratic senators. PolitiFact has fact-checked that the &quot;deciding&quot; vote for health care was <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/may/30/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-sherrod-brown-cast-deciding-vote-/\">U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown</a> of Ohio and U.S. Sen. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2010/oct/26/what-makes-vote-deciding-vote/\">Michael Bennet</a> of Colorado.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHow can so many lawmakers cast the deciding vote?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The 2009 health care vote</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor its evidence, the ad cited a <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00396\">health care vote</a>&nbsp;on Dec. 24, 2009. That vote showed 59 Democrats and one independent voting together in favor of the bill, including Nelson. (Sixty votes were needed for a preliminary cloture vote to prevent filibusters.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo couldn&rsquo;t we argue that any of the 60 cast the deciding vote?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs we <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/26/national-republican-senatorial-committee/nrsc-attacks-michael-bennet-casting-deciding-vote-/\">noted before</a>, there is a long history of senators holding back their votes until their demands are met. Some senators did hold out until the last minute -- but Nelson wasn&rsquo;t one of them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne of the detailed reports we&rsquo;ve seen on the final negotiations for the law is from the <em><a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/24/nation/la-na-health-ticktock24-2009dec24\">Los Angeles Times</a></em>. According to its report, one of the most crucial votes came from Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to the newspaper, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., &quot;knew that he had to keep Lieberman in the tent. And the next night, when Democrats gathered for a special caucus meeting, Reid did not call out the Connecticut senator, focusing instead on the need to unite and move forward.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the meeting, Reid turned to Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., who also &quot;had a long list of demands, including more restrictions on funding abortions and full federal funding to expand Nebraska&#39;s Medicaid program. ... Reid was closing in on a deal.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSuddenly, another roadblock appeared: Republican opponents of the bill threatened to filibuster -- that is, indefinitely block consideration of -- an unrelated defense appropriations bill as a way of indirectly delaying the health care measure. To get around that, Reid had to convince U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. -- an opponent of the defense bill for substantive reasons -- not to join the Republican blockade.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Reid was unwilling to challenge Feingold on a vote of conscience,&quot; the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> article reported. &quot;And when Democrats gathered for yet another special caucus meeting ... Reid was ready to concede defeat. But as dejected senators began to leave, Feingold arose: He would put aside his convictions on the war, he said, and vote with his party. &#39;I don&#39;t think there was a dry eye in the caucus room,&#39; said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThere was also a concern about whether Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., would physically be unable to reach the chamber because he had been in the hospital with a staph infection but he was brought in in a wheelchair and voted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Bill Nelson&rsquo;s role</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the summer of 2009, Bill Nelson was quiet about health care reform -- angering some Democratic activists. But in September he jumped into the fray -- offering amendments about <a href=\"http://billnelson.senate.gov/news/details.cfm?id=318376&amp;\">Medicare Advantage</a> and <a href=\"http://billnelson.senate.gov/news/details.cfm?id=318232&amp;\">Medicare drug benefits</a>. Nelson sounded cautiously supportive in news accounts -- saying he had some criticisms but called the bill a &quot;starting point.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There are serious issues to be resolved,&quot; Nelson said in a <a href=\"http://billnelson.senate.gov/news/details.cfm?id=317849&amp;\">speech</a> on the floor of the Senate in September 2009. &quot;This senator is optimistic, and I believe that we are going to be able to achieve this goal of expanding affordable health care to nearly all Americans.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn October 2009, Nelson joined other Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee in voting for the health care plan. Nelson called the package a <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/sen-bill-nelson-votes-for-health-care-plan-blasts-industry-funded-study/1043811\">&quot;good start.&quot;</a>&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn November during public stops in the Tampa Bay area, he predicted the Senate would pass a health care bill and said: &quot;If we don&#39;t do something about health care, it&#39;s going to run our country into bankruptcy.&quot; The <em>Orlando Sentinel</em> described him as an <a href=\"http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/dcblog/2009/11/florida_senators_split_on_heal_1.html\">&quot;enthusiastic cheerleader for the emerging legislation.&quot;</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAfter the December vote, the health care bill still needed changes and another round of approvals. Nelson&rsquo;s office issued a <a href=\"http://billnelson.senate.gov/news/details.cfm?id=323387&amp;\">press release</a> in March 2010 saying that despite the legislation&rsquo;s &quot;flaws&quot; -- including that it didn&rsquo;t force drug makers to reduce the costs of prescriptions -- he would support it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Nelson, who had been considered by some to be a possible swing vote, made his declaration just at the outset of Senate starting its deliberations on changes to the health care signed into law by President Obama yesterday,&quot; stated Nelson&rsquo;s press release.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The other Nelson&#39;s role</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen the recent ad from the 60 Plus Association started airing, Nelson pointed to his colleague U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., as the deciding vote. Florida&rsquo;s Nelson wrote on his <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/billnelson\">Facebook</a> page that the 60 Plus Association &quot;repeats an outrageous claim that I cast the deciding vote on health care reform legislation that cuts Medicare. First off, fact-checkers have found the legislation didn&rsquo;t cut Medicare. And second, it was BEN NELSON, not me, who cast the deciding vote.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeveral news articles described <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/health/policy/20health.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\">Sen. Ben Nelson</a> as the final key for Senate Democrats in 2009. The Nebraska senator announced his support days before the Christmas Eve vote, after he reached a compromise about abortion and federal funding for his state. But in March 2010 the Nebraska senator voted against the final <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00105\">bill</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Nebraska senator told <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/12/20/cnn-exclusive-nelson-answers-his-critics-on-health-care-reform/\">CNN</a> in December 2009: &quot;I couldn&rsquo;t create the opportunity to be the 60th vote. It happened. &hellip; If you think it&rsquo;s fun having both sides on an issue mad at you when you are trying to do something in good faith, just think it&rsquo;s like going home and getting bit by the family dog. So who enjoys that?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSen. Bill Nelson&rsquo;s Senate spokesman Dan McLaughlin told PolitiFact in an email: &quot;There&rsquo;s no way every Democratic senator could have cast the &lsquo;deciding vote.&rsquo; And there&rsquo;s no way to say Bill Nelson cast the deciding vote - when he didn&rsquo;t. Nelson didn&rsquo;t like the bill. He tried to improve it. Among other things, he offered an amendment against the drug-makers. And, he announced his vote well before the roll call. He played no extraordinary role in the final passage.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked the 60 Plus Association how it concluded that Sen. Bill Nelson was the deciding vote and forwarded the Florida senator&rsquo;s Facebook comments about Sen. Ben Nelson.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Seems very odd that (Sen. Bill Nelson) would call out a colleague as a deciding vote for legislation he wholeheartedly supported,&quot; said Gerry Scimeca, a spokesman for the 60 Plus Association, in an email. &quot;The fact is, had Nelson voted &lsquo;no&rsquo; Obamacare would have died. Without his vote, the law couldn&#39;t have passed; he could have stopped it but he didn&#39;t.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe 60 Plus Association says that Florida Sen. Bill Nelson cast the &quot;deciding vote&quot; for health care. The health care law required 60 votes, so Nelson&#39;s vote was crucial -- as were the other 59 votes. But describing Nelson as the &quot;deciding vote&quot; suggests he had some extraordinarily powerful role, and that&rsquo;s not the case. Nelson had cautiously been a supporter for months as he tried to amend the law. We rate this claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-13T16:45:57.750279", "ruling_date": "2012-06-14T11:45:23", "ruling_headline": "Was Florida's Bill Nelson \"the deciding vote\" on the health care law?", "ruling_headline_slug": "florida-bill-nelson-deciding-vote-health-care", "ruling_link_text": "Only if there were 60 \"deciding\" votes", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t60 Plus Association, <a href=\"http://60plus.org/issues/tell-nelson-stop-wasteful-spending/\">&quot;Tell Bill Nelson to protect hardworking taxpayers and stop the wasteful spending&quot;</a> ad, June 6, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://nelsonforsenate.com/\">U.S. Sen.
