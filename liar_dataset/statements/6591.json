Unemployment went down, household incomes went up, and Massachusetts, under Mitt Romney, saw its credit rating upgraded.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&rsquo;s look at the last three claims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact fact-checked the household income trends and found an increase of $5,500 under Romney without considering inflation -- but a decrease in real dollars after adjusting for inflation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat earned a Romney surrogate a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/05/ed-gillespie/gillespie-says-massachusetts-income-grew-5500-unde/\">Half True</a> for noting only the positive side of the equation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn unemployment, PolitiFact tested a Romney claim that he reduced Massachusetts unemployment to 4.7 percent.

The employment situation in Massachusetts was subject to many factors, not just the governor&rsquo;s policy.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, the credit rating.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMultiple media accounts, including stories in the <em><a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/how-mitt-romney-handled-massachusetts-spending-problems/1240133\">Tampa Bay Times</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/157095-most-gop-presidential-hopefuls-saw-their-states-credit-ratings-rise\">The Hill</a></em>, have noted that Romney was among the governors who achieved a credit rating upgrade while in office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis was how the <em>Tampa Bay Times</em> put it in a July 15, 2012, story:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRomney had an advantage of entering office as the economy was improving &mdash; though the state budget did not yet reflect it. He also had the benefit of a 2002 tax increase without having to shoulder any responsibility.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2004, Romney&#39;s administration lobbied Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s to improve Massachusetts&#39; credit rating based in part on the extra money generated by that tax hike &mdash; which raised capital gains tax rates, eliminated charitable deductions, delayed a planned cut to the state income tax and raised the state cigarette tax 75 cents.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA presentation to Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s, which was first obtained by POLITICO, included the tax increases on a computer slide that said Massachusetts &quot;acted decisively to address the fiscal crisis.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state&#39;s credit rating was upgraded four months later, from AA- to AA.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan said in his convention speech that when Romney was governor of Massachusetts, unemployment went down, household income went up, and the state&rsquo;s credit rating was upgraded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRyan&rsquo;s claim was well grounded mathematically on the unemployment and credit-rating claims. The income claim comes with a significant footnote: That increase turned to a decrease when the numbers are adjusted for inflation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe also have noted that no governor can take major credit for economic trends in his or her state.
