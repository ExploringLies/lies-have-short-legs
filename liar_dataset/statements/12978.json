I think Donald Trump himself contributed $100,000 to the foundation,&quot; he <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-august-28-2016-n639011\">said</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plouffe is right that Trump gave at least $100,000 to the foundation, a fact that Trump and his campaign readily admit. One caveat: It appears that the money came through Trump&rsquo;s own foundation, not directly from Trump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Clinton Foundation lists Donald J. Trump as a contributor with <a href=\"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%24100%2C001%20to%20%24250%2C000&amp;page=7\">a cumulative lifetime donation amount between $100,001 to $250,000</a>. It&rsquo;s not clear if Trump himself made a personal contribution, but tax forms show that the Donald J. Trump Foundation (which Trump controls) <a href=\"http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990pf_pdf_archive/133/133404773/133404773_200912_990PF.pdf\">donated $100,000 to the foundation in 2009</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-we-know-about-the-charitable-giving-by-hillary-clinton-and-donald-trump/2016/08/25/1b261400-6a30-11e6-ba32-5a4bf5aad4fa_story.html?postshare=5921472146192860&amp;tid=ss_tw\">reserved a table at the Clinton Foundation gala for $10,000 in 2010</a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s daughter Ivanka is also listed as a donor who gave between <a href=\"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%245001%20to%20%2410%2C000&amp;page=24\">$5,001 and $10,000</a> and her father-in-law, Charles Kushner, gave <a href=\"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%24250%2C001%20to%20%24500%2C000&amp;page=1\">between $250,001 and $500,000</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s gift amount places him in the top 0.2 percent of the foundation&rsquo;s donors. Most of its <a href=\"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%245001%20to%20%2410%2C000&amp;page=24\">300,000 donors</a> (85.5 percent) gave less than $250.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breaking it down by dollar amount, however, Trump&rsquo;s total contribution isn&rsquo;t that big. We estimated that the foundation has received at least $800 million in donations, over 70 percent of which came from gifts of $1 million or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, the Trump Foundation gave $926,750 to some 40 organizations (<a href=\"http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990pf_pdf_archive/133/133404773/133404773_200912_990PF.pdf\">page 18</a>). The Clinton Foundation received one of the largest gifts that year, matched or surpassed only by the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New York Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000) and the Police Athletic League ($156,000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Altogether, the Trump Foundation has donated $5.5 million to 298 charities between 2009 and 2013 according to the nonprofit&rsquo;s tax forms, <em><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilycanal/2015/12/03/donald-trump-veterans/#137263f16c9e\">Forbes </a></em><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilycanal/2015/12/03/donald-trump-veterans/#137263f16c9e\">found</a>. Trump did not make any personal contributions to his foundations during this time. (Money for the Trump Foundation in these years came from others and from investment income.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump doesn&rsquo;t deny that he donated to the Clinton Foundation that he now calls a criminal enterprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the first GOP primary debate in August 2015, Trump voluntarily brought up his giving to the Clinton Foundation when asked about <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/04/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-donald-trump-wrote-10-checks-hillary/\">his previous donations to Hillary Clinton</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me,&quot; Trump <a href=\"http://time.com/3988276/republican-debate-primetime-transcript-full-text/\">said</a>. &quot;With Hillary Clinton, I said be at my wedding, and she came to my wedding. You know why? She didn&rsquo;t have a choice, because I gave. I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good. I didn&rsquo;t know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the record, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/jul/21/carlos-curbelo/clintons-really-did-attend-donald-trumps-2005-wedd/\">the Clintons did attend Trump&rsquo;s third wedding to Melania Knauss</a>, but that occurred in 2005, four years before the $100,000 donation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few months later, Trump gave pretty similar answers when he was asked to explain the Forbes article on his charitable giving record in late January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I did give to the Clinton Foundation. What I didn&#39;t know is they&#39;d be using it for private aircraft and things like that. The Clinton Foundation was helping with Haiti and with lots of other things and I thought it was going to do some good work. So, it didn&#39;t make any difference to me,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2016/01/31/ted-cruz-attacks-donald-trump-financial-record-trump-responds/\">he said on Jan. 31&rsquo;s <em>Fox News Sunday</em>.</a> &quot;Again, I was a businessman and it was my obligation to get along with everybody, including the Clintons, including Democrats and liberals and Republicans and conservatives.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plouffe said, &quot;Donald Trump himself gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax records show the Donald J. Trump Foundation gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation in 2009, and spent an additional $10,000 for a table at a Clinton Foundation gala the following year. The Clinton Foundation also lists Donald J. Trump (as well his daughter Ivanka and Ivanka&rsquo;s father-in-law) as a contributor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that Trump made the donation through his foundation, not out of his personal income. But Trump himself acknowledges the donation. We rate Plouffe&rsquo;s statement Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/552526f7-e5b8-4ccb-9206-517f0a5819f7\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/552526f7-e5b8-4ccb-9206-517f0a5819f7</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-28T14:40:11.523194", "ruling_date": "2016-08-28T16:46:25", "ruling_headline": "Yes, Donald Trump donated $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation", "ruling_headline_slug": "yes-donald-trump-donated-100000-clinton-foundation", "ruling_link_text": "Trump acknowledges the donation", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>NBC, &quot;<em><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-august-28-2016-n639011\">Meet the Press</a></em>,&quot; Aug. 28, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton Foundation, <a href=\"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%24100%2C001%20to%20%24250%2C000&amp;page=7\">Contributors</a>, accessed Aug. 28, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Donald J.
