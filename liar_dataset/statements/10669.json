Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is known for sticking to his principles, but that might trip him up if he were to become president, a position that requires compromise, said CNN host Dana Bash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Give me an example where you have successfully compromised in the United States Senate with Democrats,&quot; Bash asked Cruz on CNN&rsquo;s <em>State of the Union</em> March 29.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz mentioned his sponsorship of a bill that denied admission to the United States any United Nations representative who poses a national security threat (a response to Iran&rsquo;s chosen U.N. representative). The bill passed unanimously in both the Senate and the House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that bill that was non-controversial, and it is the only bill Cruz has passed in his two years in office, Bash added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s fair that there&#39;s just one piece of legislation that is now law with your name on it?&quot; she asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just one? Is that right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The laws</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked through Cruz&rsquo;s legislative history on <em>Congressional Quarterly</em>&rsquo;s database and found that since he became a senator in January 2013, he has been the main sponsor on 44 bills and a cosponsor on 187.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of those on which he was the primary sponsor, only one passed, as Bash said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><a href=\"https://www.opencongress.org/bill/s2195-113/show\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">This bill</a>,&nbsp;</u>the one Cruz mentioned in the interview, passed unanimously in April 2014 and was intended to stop Iran&rsquo;s proposed U.N. envoy from entering the United States. Iranian Ambassador <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/international/203896-obama-signs-bill-blocking-iranian-envoy\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Hamid Aboutalebi</u></a> was involved in holding more than 50 Americans hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Iran in the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruz&rsquo;s name is on two more laws as a cosponsor. He was one of 80 senators to cosponsor a <a href=\"https://www.opencongress.org/bill/s2673-113/show\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>July 2014 bill</u></a> to enhance cooperative programs between the United States and Israel. He also joined a bipartisan group of 22 senators behind&nbsp;an <a href=\"https://www.opencongress.org/bill/s653-113/show\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>August 2014</u></a> bill establishing a special envoy to promote religious freedom in parts of Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that many of the bills Cruz cosponsored were Senate resolutions, which are legislative measures that don&rsquo;t go to the president and don&rsquo;t carry the force of law, such as a resolution that commemorates the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz. Many of these passed. He&rsquo;s also had measures pass through the Senate as a sponsor or cosponsor, even if they didn&rsquo;t eventually become law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it&rsquo;s true that Cruz hasn&rsquo;t had many of his ideas signed into law, but is it the best way to tell if he has been an effective senator? Experts told us it&rsquo;s an incomplete measurement, so let&rsquo;s add some context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The context</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, Cruz has only been in Congress for two years. In 2014, <em>National Journal</em> <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/which-senator-has-passed-the-most-laws-20140516\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>analyzed</u></a> which senators have sponsored or cosponsored the most bills that eventually became law and found unsurprisingly that the longer a senator had been in office, the more bills they passed. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has passed more than 740 and has been in the Senate since 1977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his first two years in the Senate, Cruz was a member of the minority party, which put him and fellow Republicans at a disadvantage. It&rsquo;s expected that the majority leader will schedule bills for his own party more frequently than for the minority, said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown University&rsquo;s Government Affairs Institute. Even&nbsp;within their own party, more junior members&rsquo; priorities are at the back of the line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;First-term senators have a lot of headwinds, particularly when in the minority,&quot; Huder said. &quot;Nothing about Cruz&#39;s position really sets him up for legislative success.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, the Senate&rsquo;s design allows for individual members to make a difference, even if they&rsquo;re not in the majority, said Sarah Binder, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert in legislative politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They make a difference in ways other than just passing laws, which weakens this particular measurement of legislative effectiveness, Binder added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They can sponsor amendments to bills, for example, or their bills can get absorbed into broad omnibus legislation. Cruz <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/06/politics/fort-hood-purple-hearts/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>successfully sponsored an amendment</u></a> to the National Defense Authorization Act that will give Purple Hearts to those killed or wounded in the shooting at Fort Hood in Texas in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or, they can put a plug in the opposing party&rsquo;s agenda. Cruz <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/26/how-ted-cruz-killed-imf-funding-a-timeline/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>played a role</u></a> in keeping an International Monetary Fund reform measure out of a bill to give aid to Ukraine. He has also <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/loretta-lynch-115438.html#.VRhPHjvF_YE\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>spearheaded efforts</u></a> to block presidential appointments to push his priorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another problem with simply counting the number of bills passed is that it doesn&rsquo;t account for individual bills&rsquo; importance or political salience, Binder added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the Senate is only one-third of the lawmaking process (the other parts being the House and the president), so much of getting a law passed is out of the sponsor&rsquo;s hands, Huder said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bash told PolitiFact she agrees that the number of laws passed is not the only barometer of success for a senator -- particularly a senator like Cruz who is interested in dismantling quite a few laws. She also said she agrees that being in the minority party during a time of excess gridlock put Cruz at a disadvantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In sum, Cruz&rsquo;s record is better than Bash makes it out to be, Huder said, but it&rsquo;s still not great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Cruz paints himself as an ideological outsider,&quot; he said. &quot;That stance isn&#39;t conducive to lawmaking in a chamber built to foster bipartisan consensus.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, Cruz essentially agreed with Bash in the interview, but blamed former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. &quot;We passed next to nothing,&quot; Cruz said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bash said there&rsquo;s only &quot;one piece of legislation that is now law that has (Ted Cruz&rsquo;s) name on it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the bills Cruz has sponsored, only one has been signed into law. However, he has cosponsored two eventual laws, as well as many resolutions that passed but didn&rsquo;t have to go to Obama&rsquo;s desk (and don&rsquo;t carry the force of law).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts told us that this isn&rsquo;t a great measurement of a legislator&rsquo;s effectiveness, and there are other ways to show his impact in Congress. Also, Cruz has had many factors working against him: He is a junior senator, and&nbsp;he spent his first two years as a member of the minority party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bash&rsquo;s claim misses that additional information. We rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-03-29T12:28:16.121252", "ruling_date": "2015-03-29T18:53:48", "ruling_headline": "How many bills has Ted Cruz passed in the Senate? 1", "ruling_headline_slug": "how-many-bills-has-ted-cruz-passed-senate", "ruling_link_text": "Missing some context", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CNN, <em>State of the Union</em> transcript, March 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CQ, Cruz member profile and bill tracker, last updated March 23, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Hill</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/international/203896-obama-signs-bill-blocking-iranian-envoy\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Obama signs bill blocking Iranian envoy</u></a>,&quot; April 18, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>National Journal</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/which-senator-has-passed-the-most-laws-20140516\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Which Senator Has Passed the Most Laws?</u></a>&quot; May 16, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Dana Bash, March 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier, March 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Joshua Huder, Government Affairs Institute senior fellow, March 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Sarah Binder, Brookings Institution senior fellow, March 29, 2015</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "CNN host", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Dana", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "", "id": 3135, "last_name": "Bash", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "dana-bash", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/bash.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3135/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>&quot;There&#39;s just one piece of legislation that is now law&quot; with Sen.
