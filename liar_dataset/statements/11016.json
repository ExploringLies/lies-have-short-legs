The proportion each source of aid makes up varies between school districts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://wasb.org/websites/communications/File/school_finance_101_web.pdf\">report</a> from the Wisconsin Association of Schools Boards shows state aid and property taxes each providing about 40 to 45 percent of overall education funding in the state. Federal funding typically makes up 6 to 7 percent. Other sources of funding like ticket sales from sporting events and building rentals comprise the last small portion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state&rsquo;s school voucher program allows parents to take the government funds that would be used to educate their child to private school of their choice, including religious schools. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;ve rated claims about spending on the program before. Opposing claims about per-pupil spending at public and voucher schools made by <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/apr/07/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-choice-schools-would-get-onl/\">Gov.
