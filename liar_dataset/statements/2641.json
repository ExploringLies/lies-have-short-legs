So if you own a home, and these laws are passed, you will be taxed by the state.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe e-mail goes on: &quot;I received a flyer from the (Texas) Secretary of State, Hope Andrade, listing the propositions that are up for election. I called to question them before sending this message out to my homeowner friends.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhoa, Nellie. Stop the presses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe are certain that there are no propositions on the statewide ballot Nov. 2. We figure too that Andrade, the state&#39;s chief elections officer, knows this and would have told a caller so.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, it&#39;s our duty at PolitiFact Texas to check stuff out. So we left Andrade a message and began our research.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur first find: The Longview News-Journal had beat us to it. In an Oct. 14 news article, the newspaper found the same e-mail misleading.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This is a good example of why we should approach the random e-mails that make it to our in boxes with a big question mark,&quot; the newspaper reminded readers. &quot;There are no statewide propositions on the Nov. 2 ballot. Texas voted on these propositions in 2009, and that&#39;s why the date in this e-mail was wrong if you&#39;re living in 2010.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOh, right. On Nov. 3, 2009, Texas voters approved 11 proposed constitutional amendments including Propositions 1, 2 and 3. Proposition 1 related to tax increment financing by cities and counties, Proposition 2 permitted state lawmakers to tie property taxes on a residence homestead solely to the property&#39;s value as a homestead and Proposition 3 provided for uniform standards and procedures for the appraisal of property for property tax purposes, according to summaries placed online by the secretary of state&#39;s office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs the Longview newspaper noted, the propositions &quot;did not create state property taxes as the e-mail claimed.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe newspaper quotes Randall Dillard, Andrade&#39;s spokesman, saying that the same e-mail circulated before the 2009 election, and it&#39;s apparently still making the rounds. &quot;It was inaccurate in 2009,&quot; Dillard said, &quot;and it&#39;s inaccurate for the November 2010 election as well.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFour days after the Longview article was published, Andrade posted a press release online stating there are no statewide propositions on the 2010 ballot. If voters want to check into anything on the ballot, the state recommends an online visit to <a href=\"http://www.votexas.org/\">www.votexas.org</a> or a telephone call to the secretary of state at 1-800-252-8683.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, we went back to the chain e-mail and noticed a clear clue that it&#39;s out of date; it provides a web <a href=\"http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/voter/2009novballotexp.shtml\">link</a> to an inactive web page about the 2009 elections.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPants on Fire!</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-20T18:00:45.894493", "ruling_date": "2010-10-21T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Chain e-mail says voters should beware of Texas propositions affecting property taxes on homesteads", "ruling_headline_slug": "chain-e-mail-says-voters-should-beware-texas-propo", "ruling_link_text": "Wrong on topics and election's timing", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/10072010_readeremailinquiry.html\">E-mail</a>, reader inquiry to PolitiFact Texas, Oct. 7, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Randall Dillard, communications director, Texas Secretary of State, Oct. 20, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLongview News-Journal, news article, <a href=\"http://www.news-journal.com/features/answer_line/article_2682ed88-f117-55a1-8db7-8cd04cb312c5.html\">&quot;What propositions are on the Nov. 2 ballot?,&quot;</a> Oct. 14, 2010 (accessed Oct. 20, 2010)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTexas Secretary of State, press release, <a href=\"http://www.sos.state.tx.us/about/newsreleases/2010/101810-no-props.shtml\">&quot;Despite rumors, Nov. 2 ballot does not include statewide propositions,&quot;</a> Oct. 18, 2010, and web page, <a href=\"http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/voter/2009novballotlang.shtml\">&quot;Ballot Language and Order for the November 3rd, 2009 Constitutional Amendment Election&quot;</a> and <a href=\"http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe\">&quot;Results&quot;</a> (accessed Oct. 20, 2010)</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Fake_news", "barely_true_count": 11, "current_job": "", "false_count": 44, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 8, "home_state": "", "id": 27, "last_name": "Chain email", "mostly_true_count": 5, "name_slug": "chain-email", "pants_count": 106, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-emailer.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/27/", "total_count": 180, "true_count": 6, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tSays Texas voters are being asked to act this November on a proposed constitutional amendment affecting property taxes.</p>", "statement_context": "a chain e-mail.", "statement_date": "2010-10-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
