It&rsquo;s safe to say, though, that Democrats are fighting back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take the Senate Majority PAC, an outside group formed in 2011 to support Democratic Senate candidates. They launched a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea0-Sx8iEus&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><u>statewide ad</u></a> in Arkansas attacking Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who&rsquo;s up against Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor come November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Corporate special interests are spending millions to smear Mark Pryor and elect Tom Cotton,&quot; the narrator said. &quot;Why? Before Congress, Cotton got paid handsomely working for insurance companies and corporate interests.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact wanted to know if Cotton really worked for insurance companies before taking office in 2013. Cotton&rsquo;s campaign didn&rsquo;t respond to our requests for comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What most people know about Cotton&rsquo;s work experience is the years he spent serving in Afghanistan and Iraq from 2005 to 2009. That experience has <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/03/sen-pryor-hit-for-saying-foe-a-decorated-vet-has-sense-of-entitlement/\"><u>come under fire</u></a> from Pryor, who accused his opponent of having a &quot;sense of entitlement&quot; about his decorated military past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly after Cotton&rsquo;s honorable discharge from the military, he worked at a global consulting firm called McKinsey &amp; Company. The firm employs 17,000 people across 60 countries. Democrats like Chelsea Clinton and Susan Rice have also worked there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate Majority PAC pointed us to Cotton&rsquo;s Facebook biography, which says, &quot;As a businessman, Tom has advised some of America&rsquo;s most respected companies on business strategy, operations, finance, and marketing. His industry experience includes agribusiness, health care, oil and gas, food processing, insurance, and aerospace.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not work directly for an insurance company. And Glenn Kessler, our <em>Washington Post</em> fact-checking colleague, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/04/01/a-democratic-attack-ad-tries-to-connect-the-dots-and-earns-4-pinocchios/\"><u>noted</u></a> that Cotton has never even worked for an insurance company in a consulting role. Cotton worked on an assignment with the Federal Housing Authority to improve insurance offered to lenders who finance apartment buildings in the government&rsquo;s multifamily housing programs, according to a statement from his former boss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Cotton didn&rsquo;t work for an insurance company. But did he get paid handsomely? That&rsquo;s a subjective judgment we won&rsquo;t weigh in on. But we can see from his <a href=\"http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00033363_2011_nom.pdf\"><u>financial disclosure statement</u></a> that Cotton earned $85,000 from McKinsey in 2011. For comparison, he makes <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%270E%2C*PL%5B%3D%23P%20%20%0A\"><u>$174,000 per year</u></a> in Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate Majority PAC ad claimed, &quot;Before Congress, Cotton got paid handsomely working for insurance companies and corporate interests.&quot; Cotton&rsquo;s never worked for an insurance company, nor has he served as a consultant for one. We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-04-09T14:50:09.530179", "ruling_date": "2014-04-09T15:03:46", "ruling_headline": "Democratic PAC says Tom Cotton 'got paid handsomely working for insurance companies'", "ruling_headline_slug": "democratic-pac-says-tom-cotton-got-paid-handsomely", "ruling_link_text": "He never worked for insurance companies", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC, &quot;<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/03/sen-pryor-hit-for-saying-foe-a-decorated-vet-has-sense-of-entitlement/\"><u>Sen.
