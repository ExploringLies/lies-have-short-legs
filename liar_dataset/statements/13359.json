Patrick Murphy at Broward College that Rubio voted against airstrikes in Syria, and asked if he favored committing ground troops there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said he would support a plan if he thought it would work but didn&rsquo;t think using American soldiers was a good option. He said he voted against Obama&rsquo;s plan because he had favored helping factions already in Syria over committing to airstrikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He (Obama) was proposing what they called pinprick strikes &mdash; basically a symbolic strike to send a message, but not backed up by a clear plan,&quot; Rubio said, without elaborating on who &quot;they&quot; were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama did use the term &quot;pinprick strikes,&quot; but it was to specifically advocate <em>against </em>what Rubio is attributing to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Military intervention</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio&rsquo;s &quot;pinprick strikes&quot; go back to 2013, when Obama was grappling with how to deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/26/world/middleeast/syria-says-un-will-get-access-to-site-of-possible-chemical-attack.html?ref=world\">chemical weapons attack against civilians</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washington had planned a military response against the Assad regime, but Obama changed his mind on Aug. 31. Instead of acting unilaterally, Obama planned to first <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/world/middleeast/syria.html?_r=1\">ask Congress to authorize an attack</a>. His approach reportedly would have involved surgical missile strikes by Navy destroyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama did use the term &quot;pinprick&quot; several times. But every time he did, it was to describe what he wanted the U.S. military to avoid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama said it during <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/six-interviews-later-a-way-out-for-obama-on-syria\">an interview blitz on Sept. 9</a>. In one example, he told <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch-obama-its-fair-say-i-haven\">the<em> Today </em>show&rsquo;s</a> Savannah Guthrie that &quot;the U.S. does not do pinpricks. Our military is the greatest the world has ever known. And when we take even limited strikes, it has an impact on a country like Syria.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no technical term like &quot;pinprick&quot; when describing any kind of military intervention, Michael O&rsquo;Hanlon, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and co-director of the institution&rsquo;s Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence, told us in a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/sep/18/marco-rubio/obama-called-potential-attack-syria-pinprick-rubio/\">previous fact-check</a> of this Rubio attack. O&rsquo;Hanlon said that in his experience, when the word is used, &quot;it is always pejorative.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on <em><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/01/world/meast/syria-civil-war/\">Face the Nation</a></em> on Sept. 1, 2013, that he wondered whether surgical strikes are &quot;just a pinprick that somehow Bashar Assad can trumpet that he defeated the United States of America.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vote mentioned at the debate came on Sept. 4, when Rubio voted against a Senate Foreign Relations Committee resolution <a href=\"http://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/DAV13973.pdf\">allowing Obama to use limited force</a> against Assad&rsquo;s regime. It passed by a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/09/04/who-voted-for-the-syria-resolution/\">10-7 vote</a> and was sent to the Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same day, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/04/us-syria-crisis-usa-hagel-idUSBRE98311F20130904\">also used the term</a> during a hearing for the House Foreign Affairs Committee on strategy in Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The president has said ... this would not be a pinprick. Those were his words. This would be a significant strike that would in fact degrade his capability,&quot; Hagel said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secretary of State John Kerry <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/09/us-syria-chemical-weapons-attack-john-kerry\">did refer to the planned intervention </a>as an &quot;unbelievably small, limited kind of effort&quot; on Sept. 9, but he didn&rsquo;t call it a &quot;pinprick.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As support waned in the Senate, Obama asked the Senate majority leader, then Harry Reid, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/09/09/obama-congress-syria-vote-in-doubt/2788597/\">to pull the measure</a>. Obama said <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/full-transcript-president-obamas-remarks-syria-f8C11126481\">on Sept. 10</a> that the military would not intervene but could in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As some members of Congress have said, there&#39;s no point in simply doing a pinprick strike in Syria,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Let me make something clear: The United States military doesn&#39;t do pinpricks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/218282-rubio-votes-for-cr-cruz-paul-vote-no\">voted in favor of arming Syrian rebels</a> a year later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio&rsquo;s campaign pointed out that Obama revisited the term in the <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/barack-obama-doris-kearns-goodwin-interview\">November 2016 issue of <em>Vanity Fair</em></a><em> </em>when he said there were no easy solutions in Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The conventional arguments about what could have been done are wrong. The notion that if we had provided some more modest arms to Syrian rebels &mdash; that somehow that would have led to Assad&rsquo;s overthrow more decisively,&quot; Obama said. &quot;The notion that if I had taken a pinprick strike when the chemical-weapons issue came out, as opposed to negotiating and getting all those chemical weapons out &mdash; that that would have been decisive. All those things I tend to be skeptical about.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not clear if Obama is characterizing his own proposed strike as a &quot;pinprick,&quot; or describing a potential attack the way others may have suggested. Even so, it&rsquo;s still clear that back in 2013, he specifically avoided defining his proposal as any form of &quot;pinprick.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"artembed\">See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubio said Obama &quot;was proposing pinprick strikes&quot; for military intervention in Syria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, Obama did suggest a limited military response &mdash; likely airstrikes from Navy ships &mdash; after Assad&rsquo;s chemical weapons attacks on civilians. Obama only used the word &quot;pinprick&quot; to describe what he didn&rsquo;t want the attacks to be, and said repeatedly that the U.S. military isn&rsquo;t built for small-scale action. And while some officials have used the term, &quot;pinprick strikes&quot; aren&rsquo;t a true military description for any kind of operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the statement False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/312c2630-210d-4b95-8f30-c16c89bb4dda\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/312c2630-210d-4b95-8f30-c16c89bb4dda</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-27T12:29:40.967843", "ruling_date": "2016-10-27T12:26:26", "ruling_headline": "U.S. Sen.
