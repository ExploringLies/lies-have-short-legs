That&#39;s how far back we go in this battle, okay?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered whether the<strong> </strong>bishops&rsquo; support for comprehensive health care really goes back nearly a century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts pointed us to the history of the National Catholic Welfare Council, the predecessor of the<strong> </strong>United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The council held an annual meeting in which U.S. bishops discussed national policy issues such as education, welfare and health care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the February 1919, meeting, held just after World War I, a group of bishops, led by a Catholic social reformer, <a href=\"http://cuomeka.wrlc.org/exhibits/show/bishops/ryan/1919ryan-intro\"><u>Father John A. Ryan</u></a>, published the <em>Bishops&rsquo; Program of Social Reconstruction</em>, a guide to <a href=\"http://cuomeka.wrlc.org/exhibits/show/bishops/background/1919-wel\"><u>overhauling U.S. social justice</u></a>. Dolan was referring to a<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://cuomeka.wrlc.org/files/original/835f26c0ebabbd7ba0d55b60dabb47b0.pdf\"><u>section on social insurance</u></a>, his spokesman said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The state,&quot; the guide read, &quot;should make comprehensive provision for insurance against illness, invalidity, unemployment, and old age.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the last time the USCCB has supported health care expansions. For example,<strong> </strong>the group has publicly supported a variety of<strong> </strong>proposals, including former President Bill Clinton&rsquo;s ultimately defeated <a href=\"http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/health-care/upload/health-care-comprehensive-care.pdf\"><u>health care plan</u></a> in 1993.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The flap is over the (contraception) issue,&quot; said Maria Mazzenga, a Catholic history archivist at The Catholic University of America. &quot;That&rsquo;s where it comes to appear that they&rsquo;re against universal health care.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mazzenga said that, despite opposition to one specific part of Obamacare, all but the most conservative bishops have consistently supported health care efforts over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dolan said U.S. bishops have supported expanding health care since 1919. He&rsquo;s correct that the National Catholic Welfare Council published pro-health-care expansion literature that year, and experts told us that the bishops have regularly supported proposals to expand health care over the years, despite disagreements over specific provisions enacted under Obama, including contraception regulations.<strong> </strong>We rate Dolan&rsquo;s claim True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-12-04T13:57:13.393502", "ruling_date": "2013-12-04T14:08:18", "ruling_headline": "U.S. bishops have supported universal health care since 1919, Cardinal Dolan says", "ruling_headline_slug": "us-bishops-have-supported-universal-health-care-19", "ruling_link_text": "It's been almost a century", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Acton Institute, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.acton.org/pub/commentary/2012/02/08/obamacare-vs-catholic-bishops\"><u>Obamacare versus the Catholic bishops</u></a>,&quot; Dec. 3, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Catholic Bishops of the United States, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/health-care/upload/health-care-comprehensive-care.pdf\"><u>A framework for comprehensive health care reform</u></a>,&quot; June 18, 1993</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Catholic University of America, &quot;<a href=\"http://cuomeka.wrlc.org/exhibits/show/bishops/background/1919-wel\"><u>Catholics and Social Welfare, 1919</u></a>,&quot; accessed Dec. 4, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Catholic University of America, &quot;<a href=\"http://cuomeka.wrlc.org/exhibits/show/bishops/ryan/1919ryan-intro\"><u>Who was John A.
