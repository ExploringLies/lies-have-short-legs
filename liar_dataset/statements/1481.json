Rick Perry, running for re-election, claims the &quot;tough conservative decisions&quot; he&rsquo;s made during his tenure have been a boon to the state, resulting in surplus revenue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Today, we have billions in surplus,&quot; he says in a TV ad that debuted Monday.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs that right? Seems like just the other day &mdash; as in last month &mdash; Republican leaders including Perry asked state agencies to suggest possible budget cuts due to an anticipated revenue shortfall.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPerry&rsquo;s campaign cites a Nov. 24 report by Texas State Comptroller Susan Combs forecasting the state would have $8.2 billion in its Economic Stabilization Fund by Aug. 31, 2011. The so-called rainy day fund, which voters created in 1988, held $7.6 billion as of Feb. 9.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe fund is fed almost exclusively by oil and natural-gas production taxes; revenue above a certain level is automatically diverted to it. That revenue soared during the past decade, allowing billions to accumulate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo the state now has billions in reserve.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut a healthy rainy day fund doesn&rsquo;t always mean there&rsquo;s a surplus built to last.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSherri Greenberg, a former Democratic state representative who served on the House Appropriations Committee, said that the excess oil and gas taxes are &quot;not the same as a surplus&quot; because they aren&rsquo;t necessarily &quot;revenues coming in that exceed what our expenditures are going to be.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGreenberg, who lectures at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, noted too that it&rsquo;s not easy to tap the fund. In the 2011 session, Lawmakers will legally be permitted to dip into the fund for any reason by two-thirds&#39; votes of the House and Senate. If they&#39;re faced with revenue running short of what&#39;s needed to fund the current (2010-11) budget, they can take money from the fund by getting three-fifths&#39; votes of each body. The same reduced threshold applies to tapping the fund if state revenue for the 2012-13 fiscal years is projected to run short of revenue that comes in during 2010-11. Other fiscal decisions take simple majority votes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBesides, experts expect lawmakers to be facing a revenue shortfall by the time they write the next two-year state budget in 2011. Factors at play include the need to continue covering the costs of a statewide school property tax cut approved in 2006 and the unlikelihood of fresh federal stimulus aid, some of which helped lawmakers balance the budget last year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJohn O&rsquo;Brien, director of the Legislative Budget Board, which advises legislators on budget matters, recently estimated that the current pace of spending will exceed incoming revenue by $11 billion by the time the 2012 fiscal year begins on Sept. 1, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState sales-tax collections are already running $1 billion behind what Combs projected they would be at this time.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn Jan. 15, Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus instructed state agencies to submit budget-reduction plans by Feb. 15 for the start of next fiscal year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs they have done in the past, lawmakers could tap the rainy day fund to reconcile the gap. Faced with a similar $10 billion revenue shortfall in 2003, lawmakers also made painful budget and program cuts, including consolidating 12 health and human service agencies into five.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;The point of the rainy day fund is to have it there in case there&rsquo;s a need,&quot; Perry spokesman Mark Miner said. &quot;Just like we did in 2003, we&rsquo;ll cut spending and take measures to balance the budget.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe upshot: Perry&rsquo;s correct for the moment in that the state has socked away billions in the Economic Stabilization Fund.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut his surplus claim implies Texas is awash in cash &mdash; suggesting at least enough to continue government operations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe knows better. We rate Perry&rsquo;s statement as Barely True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Update: The description above of how money can be spent from the so-called rainy day fund reflects a clarification from what we originally posted.
