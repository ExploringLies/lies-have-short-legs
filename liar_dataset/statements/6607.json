Bush, in an Aug. 15, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.slysoffice.com/\">interview</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe told John &quot;Sly&quot; Sylvester, a liberal talk show host on WTDY-AM and -FM in Madison:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We have written into law, under Tommy Thompson&#39;s watch, a prohibition for the federal government to be involved in negotiating with pharmaceutical companies for better prices for seniors for drugs. That&#39;s unbelievable. You know, if you buy in bulk, you get a better deal.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLet&#39;s check both parts of Baldwin&rsquo;s claim -- that the government is prohibited from negotiating on drug prices and that Thompson played a role in creating the ban.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Negotiating drug prices</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMedicare Part D is a <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/medicare/rxdrugbenefit.cfm\">voluntary</a> insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare. Congress created it by passing legislation in 2003, although the program didn&rsquo;t take effect until 2006.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere is some background from PolitiFact National:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn rating as <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/15/rick-santorum/did-medicare-part-d-come-40-percent-under-budget-b/\">Half True</a> a claim by former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum -- that Medicare Part D came in 40 percent under budget because of its design -- our colleagues explained that private insurance companies offer a variety of plans subsidized by the government, and beneficiaries get to choose the plan that&#39;s best for them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact National has also <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/73/allow-medicare-to-negotiate-for-cheaper-drug-price/\">reported</a>on the program as part of its <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/\">Obameter</a>, which tracks promises President Barack Obama made as a candidate in 2008.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince Congress approved the program, proposed by Bush, Democrats have groused that it was a huge giveaway for the pharmaceutical industry because it did not allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Obama vowed to change the program to allow Medicare negotiate lower prices. But he backed away from the pledge during negotiations over his health care reform bill, and no provision on negotiating drug prices was included in the bill that became law in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(That eventually led our colleagues to rate Obama&rsquo;s pledge as a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/73/allow-medicare-to-negotiate-for-cheaper-drug-price/\">Promise Broken</a>.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat isn&rsquo;t to say there isn&rsquo;t any negotiating.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA July 2006 <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/business/18place.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">article</a> cited by Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus reported that &quot;Congress -- in what critics saw as a sop to the drug industry &mdash; barred the government from having a negotiating role. Instead, prices are worked out between drug makers and the dozens of large and small Part D drug plans run by commercial insurers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir also cited the negotiating done by the various companies offering Medicare Part D plans, arguing it has resulted in the overall cost of Medicare Part D to be lower than projected.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(PolitiFact National found in June 2011, in rating Santorum&rsquo;s claim, that the program came in under budget because fewer people than expected used it, drug spending increased less than expected and the program had encouraged use of generic drugs.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we&rsquo;re not here to settle Nemoir&rsquo;s claim; and one could argue, as Baldwin does, that costs could be even lower if the federal government did the negotiating.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen we checked back with Nemoir, he acknowledged that the federal government is prohibited from negotiating drug prices on behalf of Medicare Part D plans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Thompson&rsquo;s role</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe second part of Baldwin&rsquo;s claim is that the prohibition was put into law &quot;under Thompson&rsquo;s watch&quot; -- indicating he didn&rsquo;t unilaterally impose the ban, but played a role.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKraus cited a number of news articles, including <a href=\"http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-119540213.html\">one</a> in the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> that said Thompson was the Bush administration&rsquo;s &quot;point man&quot;
