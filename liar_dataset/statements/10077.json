Within that group, we found just three instances of new laws that you could say<strong>&nbsp;</strong>made it easier to buy a weapon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(There are examples of states&nbsp;relaxing&nbsp;rules on carrying concealed weapons and the places where guns are allowed, but Shields specifically&nbsp;spoke about it being easier to buy guns.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of 16 states, only Michigan, Ohio&nbsp;and Florida relaxed some&nbsp;rules on gun purchasing. We&#39;ll explain the changes in each state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Changes in Michigan, Ohio and Florida</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michigan emerged from 2010 with Republicans in charge of everything -- the governor&rsquo;s office and both the House and the Senate. With large majorities in both chambers, they did away with the state system of requiring handgun buyers to get a purchase permit. Until then, a person who wanted to buy a handgun had to correctly answer at least seven out of 10 questions on gun safety. If they managed that, they got a card that they could take to a gun dealer and buy a weapon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steven Howard is a lawyer and firearms expert based in Lansing, Mich. Howard said doing away with the purchase permit made little difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Brady background check remained in effect,&quot; Howard said. &quot;If you didn&rsquo;t pass the Brady test, they didn&rsquo;t sell you the gun.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But on a gun owner&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://forum.opencarry.org/forums/showthread.php?110240-Purchase-Permits-amp-CPL-s-no-longer-required-at-gun-stores-for-handgun-purchase\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>online discussion board</u></a>, the end of the purchase permit was well received. A Michigan user called &quot;Mike the Greek&quot; was surprised to see notice of the relaxed rules in the window of his local gun store. &quot;Not sure if this is everywhere, &nbsp;but it sure makes it easier for some people to buy!&quot; he wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking around at other states, according to records kept by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Ohio passed a law in 2011 that allowed people convicted of misdemeanor drug offenses to purchase firearms. In the midterm election, Republicans had taken the governor&rsquo;s office and the Ohio House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Florida, where the governor&rsquo;s office also changed hands (from an independent to a Republican), counties were barred from imposing their own waiting periods on firearm purchases. (Most of the discussion in creating the Florida law was centered around where people could carry weapons, not about purchasing firearms.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Experts on both sides agree</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laura Cutilletta is senior staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Cutilletta said there was no significant easing of gun buying rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There were certainly some laws that affect purchase, but they are not the majority by any means,&quot; Cutilletta said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joseph Olson, a retired professor of law at Hamline University, and former board member of the National Rifle Association, also saw little change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;A few states made it more difficult in some instances but almost all states did nothing regarding this issue,&quot; Olson said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Erich Pratt, director of communications for Gun Owners of America, told us the same thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of notes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;In 2012, Virginia repealed the restriction against the purchase of more than one handgun in a 30-day period. However, 2010 had no effect on the party balance of power in Virginia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp;A <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/10/us/state-gun-laws-enacted-in-the-year-since-newtown.html?_r=1&amp;\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>review of state gun laws</u></a> passed after the December 2012 shootings in Newtown, Conn., found that states with full Republican controll accounted for nearly three quarters of the changes that enhanced gun rights, mainly easing the rules for carrying weapons. But again, those change are distinct from the rules for buying a gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shields said that when Republicans took control of state legislatures in 2010 they made it easier to buy a gun. Out of 16 states won by the GOP, three passed laws that relaxed the rules for some gun buyers. The experts we reached said the changes were modest and not as widespread as Shields implied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-15T11:44:52.713351", "ruling_date": "2014-10-16T10:27:40", "ruling_headline": "Mark Shields: GOP's 2010 statehouse gains eased rules for gun buyers", "ruling_headline_slug": "shields-gops-2010-statehouse-gains-eased-rules-gun", "ruling_link_text": "Small changes in just a few states", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>PBS, <em>Newshour</em>, Oct. 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, <a href=\"http://smartgunlaws.org/gun-laws-matter-a-comparison-of-state-firearms-laws-and-statistics/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Gun Laws Matter: A Comparison of State Firearms Laws and Statistics</u></a>, July 1, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, <a href=\"http://smartgunlaws.org/gun-laws-matter-2012-understanding-the-link-between-weak-laws-and-gun-violence/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Gun Laws Matter 2012: &nbsp;Understanding the Link Between Weak Laws and Gun Violence</u></a>, Nov. 14, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opencarry.org, <a href=\"http://forum.opencarry.org/forums/showthread.php?110240-Purchase-Permits-amp-CPL-s-no-longer-required-at-gun-stores-for-handgun-purchase\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Online discussion forum</u></a>, Jan. 14, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/10/us/state-gun-laws-enacted-in-the-year-since-newtown.html?_r=1&amp;\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>State Gun Laws Enacted in the Year Since Newtown</u></a>, Dec. 10, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rasmussen Reports, <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/political_commentary/commentary_by_tim_storey/gop_makes_historic_state_legislative_gains_in_2010\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>GOP Makes Historic State Legislative Gains in 2010</u></a>, Dec. 10, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National Conference of State Legislatures, <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/2010-postelection-control-of-legislatures.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2010 election results</u></a>, 2010</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallup, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/168962/voter-enthusiasm-down-sharply-2010.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Voter Enthusiasm Down Sharply From 2010</u></a>, May 12, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, <a href=\"https://www.atf.gov/content/firearms/firearms-industry/permanent-brady-permit-chart\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Permanent Brady Permit Chart</u></a>, June 10, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130915191418/http://www.atf.gov/content/firearms/firearms-industry/permanent-brady-permit-chart\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Permanent Brady Permit Chart</u></a>, Aug. 26, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talking Points Memo, <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/how-pro-gun-laws-swept-the-nation-since-2009-a-guide\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>How Pro-Gun Laws Swept The Nation Since 2009: A Guide</u></a>, April 16, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Laura Cutilletta, senior staff attorney, Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Oct. 14, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Joseph Olson, professor of law, Hamline University, Oct. 13, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, Steven C.
