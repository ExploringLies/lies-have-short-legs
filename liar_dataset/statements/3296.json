Conservative activist Michael Quinn Sullivan offered the answer in a Feb. 18 e-mail blast: &quot;If you printed a $1 bill for the entirety of the $14.1 trillion national debt, the resulting pile of money would weigh more than 136 aircraft carriers,&quot; said the president of the free-market group Empower Texans.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSullivan pointed us to the U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which prints billions of dollars each year for the Federal Reserve. According to frequently-asked-questions page on the bureau&#39;s website, a U.S. note worth any amount &mdash; from $1 to a Benjamin &mdash; weighs one gram. About 454 grams equals a pound.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAccording to the Treasury Department&rsquo;s Bureau of Public Debt, the total outstanding public debt as of Feb. 18 was about $14.1 trillion. So,14.1 trillion dollar bills weigh 14.1 trillion grams, or about 31 billion pounds.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt Sullivan&rsquo;s suggestion, we checked the weight of the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier. According to the military&rsquo;s Naval Vessel Register, there are a couple of ways to put the carrier on the scale. At its full displacement, including crew, cargo and ammunition, the USS Reagan weighs 98,235 long tons. That&rsquo;s 220,046,400 pounds.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd 136 USS Reagans? About 30 billion pounds.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen the ship is ready for service but missing its crew and ammunition, among other variables, the Reagan weighs 77,607 long tons, or 173,839,680 pounds. Multiply by 136 and you&rsquo;ve got nearly 24 billion pounds of empty aircraft carrier.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut what&rsquo;s the point of an empty ship? We found that other aircraft carriers, fully loaded, weighed about the same. The USS <a href=\"http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/CVN77.htm\">George H. W. Bush</a> weighs in the same as the Reagan, while the <a href=\"http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/CVN73.htm\">USS George Washington</a> weighs 104,017 long tons at its full displacement. That&rsquo;s 232,998,080 pounds.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat means 136 Washingtons weigh about 31.5 billion pounds &mdash; 500 million pounds more than the national debt. And the <a href=\"http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/CVN75.htm\">USS Harry S. Truman</a>? They&rsquo;re a svelte 101,378 long tons at full displacement, so it takes more than 136 of them to equal the the national debt.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWeighing in: The national debt in dollars totals more than 136 fully loaded USS Reagan, Bush and Truman aircraft carriers. Other carrier weights differ, but they&rsquo;re in the ballpark. We rate Sullivan&rsquo;s statement as True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-02-23T15:59:57.190333", "ruling_date": "2011-02-25T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Michael Quinn Sullivan says that the debt weighs more than 136 aircraft carriers", "ruling_headline_slug": "michael-quinn-sullivan-says-debt-weighs-more-136-a", "ruling_link_text": "136 USS Ronald Reagans", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tInterview with Michael Quinn Sullivan, Feb. 18, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. Department of Treasury, <a href=\"http://www.moneyfactory.gov/faqlibrary.html\">Bureau of Engraving and Printing, FAQ Library</a>, accessed Feb. 18, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tU.S. Department of Treasury, U.S. Department of Public Debt, <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">The debt to the penny and who holds it</a>, updated Feb. 17, 2011, accessed Feb. 18, 2011</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe U.S. Navy, Navy Vessel Register, <a href=\"http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/cvn76.htm\">USS Ronald Reagan</a>, last updated Oct. 10, 2004, accessed Feb. 18, 2011</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "president and ceo, Empower Texans", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Michael", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Texas", "id": 573, "last_name": "Sullivan", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "michael-sullivan", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/michaelquinnsullivan.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Texas", "edition": "Texas", "edition_slug": "texas", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 2, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Texas Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/2/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/573/", "total_count": 6, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://www.empowertexans.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;If you printed a $1 bill for the entirety of the $14.1 trillion national debt, the resulting pile of money would weigh more than 136 aircraft carriers.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "an e-mail blast", "statement_date": "2011-02-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 183, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/183/", "subject": "Deficit", "subject_slug": "deficit", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/10/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
