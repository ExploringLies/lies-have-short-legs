Most of the political hay comes from Perdue saying that he &quot;spent most of my career&quot; establishing work and supply lines in foreign countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Oct. 7 debate, Nunn pounced on something else she found in the 186-page document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He talked about 16 countries,&quot; Nunn said. &quot;Not once did he talk about creating jobs in the United States.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the outcome of the race is expected to help decide control of the Senate, and polls show a potential runoff, the claim called out for a spin on the Truth-O-Meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, some background. The deposition was taken as part of a bankruptcy lawsuit against Pillowtex, a North Carolina textile company that failed shortly after Perdue&rsquo;s brief tenure as CEO<strong>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perdue, who was CEO at Dollar General when he was deposed, said his turnaround plan when he joined Pillowtex in 2002 called for a mix of marketing and outsourcing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>High-end products would be made in America, while lower-cost products would be manufactured overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was the idea, at least, until Perdue and other Pillowtex executives found a large unfunded liability missed when the firm exited its first bankruptcy. Unable to execute his plan, Perdue left after less than a year and the firm eventually collapsed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The legal interrogation lays out that failure and includes Perdue&rsquo;s description of various executive jobs where he specialized in outsourcing with firms such as Reebok and Sara Lee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked specifically about his &quot;experience&quot; with outsourcing, Perdue goes on at length about that background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I dealt with companies from Japan westward &nbsp;all the way to Kenya and Lesotho in Africa, Dubai, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam, all points west of Japan,&quot; Perdue said in part of his answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to those 12 countries, Perdue mentions three more and Hong Kong, now part of China. He does not reference the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s technically 16 then-nations. So is the case closed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not without an understanding of how a deposition works. For the interrogation, Perdue would have been under oath, sworn to answer honestly the questions posed to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A deposition is similar to taking the witness stand, but there is no judge present to referee the questions and answers, said Jill Polster, an Atlanta defense attorney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means the attorney of the person being deposed counsels them to be sure to answer only the question posed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I tell all of my witnesses, you answer the question that is asked and no more,&quot; Polster said. &quot;Witnesses can sometimes talk about whatever they want to talk about, but that would be weird in a deposition. It&rsquo;s a narrow inquiry.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Perdue&rsquo;s case, that narrow focus was, unsurprisingly, on his business successes finding low-cost manufacturing plants and labor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The line of questioning that led to Perdue to talk about his experience in other countries included: &quot;Can you describe your experience with outsourcing?&quot; &quot;When you joined Reebok, was Reebok outsourcing all of its product to Asia?&quot; and, &quot;At any of your jobs prior to Pillowtex, were you involved at all in building the infrastructure of outsourcing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, there were no questions about the United States. And the structure of a deposition would not allow for much free form discussion about jobs there, even if Perdue wanted to bring that up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Derrick Dickey, Perdue&rsquo;s spokesman, said a careful reading of the deposition could show Perdue was trying to show efforts to save American jobs &ndash; not just outsource them &ndash; with his turnaround plan for Pillowtex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, at the time Perdue was starting work on <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/perdue-proud-of-outsourcing-past-blames-washington/nhcsk/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>creating thousands of jobs at Dollar General</u></a>, through a massive expansion of the discount chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the list of countries doesn&rsquo;t get into that, Dickey said, because no question was posed for him to answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He was obliged to answer what the attorney was asking about,&quot; Dickey said. &quot;It&rsquo;s disgusting to twist it to say otherwise.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nunn is accurate to say Perdue lists job creation in 16 countries in his 2005 deposition. The United States isn&rsquo;t one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But legal experts say it is unfair to focus too much on a missing answer in a deposition, since the real culprit would be a missing question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nunn&rsquo;s claim contains an element of truth but takes it out of context to be misleading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-13T15:15:04.208686", "ruling_date": "2014-10-14T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Key context missing in attack on Perdue's job record", "ruling_headline_slug": "key-context-missing-attack-perdues-job-record", "ruling_link_text": "Only asked questions can be addressed in depositions", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/perdue-proud-of-outsourcing-past-blames-washington/nhcsk/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Perdue &lsquo;proud&rsquo; of outsourcing past, blames Washington for jobs lost,</u></a>&quot; Oct., 6, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WMAZ Television, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.13wmaz.com/story/news/local/2014/10/07/senate-candidates-meet-in-debate/16889377/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Nunn, Perdue clash on outsourcing, healthcare at debate,&quot; (Part 3)</u></a>, Oct. 7, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David Perdue 2005 <a href=\"http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/news/documents/2014/10/08/PerduePillowtexDeposition.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Pillowtex deposition</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Jill Polster, Atlanta attorney, Oct. 13, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Derrick Dickey, spokesman for Republican U.S. Senate Candidate David Perdue, Oct. 8, 2014</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 3, "current_job": "Chief Executive Officer, Points of Light Foundation", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Michelle", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 2356, "last_name": "Nunn", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "michelle-nunn", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Michelle_Nunn2.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2356/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 2, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>The United States was not one of 16 countries where David Perdue said in his Pillowtex deposition that he created jobs.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a U.S. Senate debate", "statement_date": "2014-10-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 21, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/21/", "subject": "Elections", "subject_slug": "elections", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 3, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/3/", "subject": "Job Accomplishments", "subject_slug": "job-accomplishments", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
