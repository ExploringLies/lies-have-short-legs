Currently, the nation&rsquo;s capital has only a non-voting delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives and no U.S. senators. The issue has been such a frustration that D.C. license plates feature the protest motto, &quot;Taxation Without Representation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s against this backdrop that we noticed a Facebook post recently. Here&rsquo;s the text:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Washington, D.C., now has:<br />\r\n\t&quot;Greater population than Wyoming &amp; Vermont<br />\r\n\t&quot;More active duty military than 29 states<br />\r\n\t&quot;More tax revenue than 29 states<br />\r\n\t&quot;A larger domestic product than 27 states<br />\r\n\t&quot;But no vote on the floor of the House OR the Senate?<br />\r\n\t&quot;What&rsquo;s up with that?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered how accurate the post&rsquo;s claims were, so we took a look. We&rsquo;ll take them in order.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&bull; Greater population than Wyoming and Vermont</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis one&rsquo;s true, as long as you use <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2012/tables/NST-EST2012-01.xls\">2012 population estimates</a> rather than the last full Census count in 2010. (D.C.&rsquo;s population grew quickly within that two-year span.) In 2012, the district was estimated to have 632,323 residents, putting it ahead of Vermont at 626,011 and Wyoming at 576,412, but no other state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&bull; More active duty military than 29 states</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe most recent <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0509.pdf\">data</a> we found was for 2009, and it shows that the Facebook post actually underestimated the nation&rsquo;s capital. There are 31 states that had fewer active duty military personnel than D.C. (This may not be too surprising, given that the Pentagon is just across the river in Virginia.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> &bull; More tax revenue than 29 states</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe U.S. Census Bureau <a href=\"http://www2.census.gov/govs/statetax/11staxrank.pdf\">ranks all 50 states</a> by tax revenue collected, but it doesn&rsquo;t include D.C. However, we were able to find the <a href=\"http://cfo.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ocfo/publication/attachments/11_taxfacts_fy_2012_online_version.pdf\">D.C. data</a> separately, in a D.C. government document.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMeshing the data together, we found that D.C. total tax revenue for fiscal year 2011 was higher than 14 states, not 29 states. So this claim is incorrect.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&bull; A larger gross domestic product than 27 states</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tData from the <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_state/2012/xls/gsp0612.xls\">U.S. Commerce Department</a> shows that for fiscal year 2011, the district only outranked 17 states with a smaller gross domestic product than D.C. So this statistic is off the mark as well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found that the Facebook post was accurate in describing D.C.&rsquo;s ranking in population and active-duty military personnel, but significantly off in describing tax revenues and gross domestic product. That said, D.C.&rsquo;s actual rankings -- higher than 14 states in tax revenues and higher than 17 states in gross domestic product -- do support the post&rsquo;s underlying point that many smaller states have congressional representation when D.C. does not. On balance, we rate the post Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-02-06T14:48:46.381771", "ruling_date": "2013-02-06T15:54:40", "ruling_headline": "D.C. voting-rights post offers hit-and-miss data", "ruling_headline_slug": "dc-voting-rights-post-offers-hit-and-miss-data", "ruling_link_text": "Stats are a mixed bag", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2012/index.html\">Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012</a>, accessed Feb. 6, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStatistical Abstract of the United States, <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0509.pdf\">Table 508.
