Republicans argue photo IDs are necessary to safeguard the voting process from fraud, while Democrats warn that legislation would disenfranchise minority and poor voters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>At a League of Women Voters&rsquo; town hall meeting in Columbia, state Rep. Caleb Rowden said most people are behind the idea. The Columbia Republican said &quot;70 percent of Missourians support voter photo ID legislation.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>We decided to look into that.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Rowden said he based his 70 percent figure on a poll conducted by Remington Research in Missouri Scout, a political subscription service. He also said he has internally polled the district he represents.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The survey Rowden cited put the question this way: &quot;The legislature is proposing to require voters to show a valid Missouri driver&rsquo;s license or other valid identification in order to vote. Do you agree or disagree with this?&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Remington&rsquo;s poll said 70 percent of Missourians said they agreed, with results varying city-to-city.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The hitch is that the poll does not clarify what &quot;other valid identification&quot; entails. Defining what does and does not constitute &quot;valid identification&quot; is the crux of <a href=\"http://www.house.mo.gov/billsummary.aspx?bill=HJR53&amp;year=2016&amp;code=R\" target=\"_blank\">a proposed Missouri bill</a>.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>As Missouri law stands now, any form of ID issued by Missouri, the federal government or another state is accepted as proof of identity to vote. Those forms include driver&rsquo;s licenses from another state, birth certificates, student IDs, utility bills and bank statements. Not all of those include a photo.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In contrast, the Missouri bill would require one of four documents, all of which include photos: a Missouri driver&rsquo;s license; a Missouri non-driver&rsquo;s license (state ID); a military ID; or a national government-issued form of ID with a signature and photograph.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Marvin Overby, MU&nbsp;professor of political science at , said changes in phrasing when it comes to survey research can lead to different results.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;To a lot of people, it&rsquo;s just common-sense rhetoric that you need a photo ID to do lots of things in life, including voting,&quot; he said. &quot;But if the wording laid out more exact points, such as the fact that the proposed legislation doesn&rsquo;t include student IDs or out-of-state licenses, you might get a different response.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>That said, evidence from national polling suggests Rowden might be on solid ground.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Nationwide support for photo ID</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The Pew Research Center found that 77 percent of Americans supported photo voter ID requirements.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>A poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports this summer illustrated a similar trend, showing more than three-quarters of Americans are in favor of requiring a photo ID to vote. That poll asked, &quot;Should voters be required to show photo identification such as a driver&rsquo;s license before being allowed to vote?&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Unlike the poll cited by Rowden, the Rasmussen Reports poll specifically defined a valid ID as one requiring a photo.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Rasmussen Reports Managing Editor Fran Coombs said the goal is to keep any potential bias out of survey questions.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;As a rule, we just try to keep the questioning as simple as possible,&quot; she said. &quot;The important thing is not to influence the responses with the wording of the question.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Even those who disagree with the idea of requiring photo identification don&rsquo;t dispute that surveys show a high level of support for the idea. Missouri&rsquo;s League of Women Voters&rsquo; Voter Protection and Service Director Kathleen Farrell said people might not know the details of the legislation that surveys ask about.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&quot;The average person might not know just how strict Missouri&rsquo;s proposed legislation is,&quot; she said. &quot;They also may not know how expensive it could be to require photo ID for all voters.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The bill&rsquo;s fiscal note allows for up to about $10.7 million dollars of funding; if the necessary funds were not allocated, the requirements for photo identification to vote would not be implemented.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Rowden&rsquo;s statement that &quot;70 percent of Missourians support voter photo ID identification&quot; isn&rsquo;t fully supported by the poll he provided. The poll Rowden cited only asks about &quot;requiring Missouri driver&rsquo;s licenses or other valid form of ID to vote.&quot; It doesn&rsquo;t specify that the proposed legislation restricts valid identification to IDs that have photos.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>But national polls show about 75 percent of Americans support requiring a photo ID to vote. The wording in the poll Rowden cited is confusing, but the results mirror the national trend.
