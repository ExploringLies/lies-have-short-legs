But the Affordable Care Act, adopted in 2010, relies largely on the free market, with employers continuing to provide health insurance to most Americans through private insurance companies. Indeed, a larger number of people will get private health coverage through the creation of insurance exchanges.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Thompson&rsquo;s statement wasn&rsquo;t as sweeping. He charged that legislation backed by Baldwin would have the government &quot;take over your decisions&quot; on medicine, doctors and hospitals.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince it is clear Baldwin has supported going beyond &quot;Obamacare,&quot; that raises the question of whether Thompson&rsquo;s specific point could be accurate.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe cited two legislative efforts to back Thompson&rsquo;s statement, correctly pointing out that Baldwin supported Obama&rsquo;s reform law, even though it didn&rsquo;t go as far as she wanted, and that she supports a &quot;single-payer&quot; health care system.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ll note that while Obama&rsquo;s law has been adopted (although not all features are yet in place), we can only speculate on the details of a single-payer health care system, since a single-payer system has not been adopted.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&quot;Obamacare&quot;:</strong> Boothe argued the reform law &quot;puts the government in between a patient and their doctor in Medicare.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut she didn&rsquo;t elaborate, other than to claim Obama is cutting Medicare funding (which PolitiFact Florida called <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/aug/20/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-cuts-716-medicare-pay-obamacare/\">Half True</a>, given that his reform law reduces the growth of Medicare spending).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoothe also argued the law &quot;leaves an unaccountable board of 15 unelected bureaucrats in charge of rationing care and limiting access to health care.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact National has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/22/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-ending-medicare-we-k/\">reported</a> that while Obama&rsquo;s plan establishes a board to make recommendations about future savings, it does not outline a dramatic, structural overhaul of the program. Moreover, our colleagues have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney/romney-says-ipab-board-can-tell-people-ultimately-/\">found</a>, the board doesn&rsquo;t make decisions for individuals.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>&quot;Single-payer&quot;:</strong> Single-payer refers to a health care system in which the government pays for all health care services but is not involved in the delivery of health care.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBoothe argued that under single-payer, if, for example, &quot;an area has three different hospitals, the government could come in and dictate which one they will continue to fund.&quot; Or, she said, the government could decide not to fund religious-affiliated hospitals, &quot;thus removing you from your doctor and health care provider, and ultimately making decisions on your behalf.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut a system in which the government pays for all health care isn&rsquo;t the same as one in which the government &quot;will take over your decisions on medicine, on doctors and on hospitals.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus pointed out that a single-payer <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.676:\">measure</a> Baldwin introduced in 2009 would have allowed patients &quot;<a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c111:1:./temp/%7Ec111CvBoaK:e7711:\">free choice</a> of participating physicians and other clinicians, hospitals, and inpatient care facilities.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Health policy experts</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted three experts: George Washington University health policy professor <a href=\"http://sphhs.gwu.edu/faculty/index.cfm?empName=%20Brian%20Biles&amp;employeeID=24\">Brian Biles</a>; Georgetown University health systems administration professor <a href=\"http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/rbf4/?PageTemplateID=364\">Robert Friedland</a>; and Baruch College health care policy professor <a href=\"http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/spa/facultystaff/facultydirectory/bio_shoshanna_sofaer.php\">Shoshanna Sofaer</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNone was persuaded by Thompson&rsquo;s claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the health care reform law&rsquo;s changes to Medicare, Biles said the law will put more people into private insurance plans, through the creation of &quot;exchanges,&quot; allowing them to choose from among private plans. Private insurers already limit access to certain doctor and hospital networks, as they did before the health reform law, and that isn&rsquo;t the government making decisions for a patient, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSofaer said virtually any physician in good standing and any accredited hospital can participate in Medicare, and that Obama&rsquo;s law does nothing to change that. The law also does not change what medications or medical services are covered by Medicare, she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd while the Medicare advisory board is to recommend changes, said Friedland, &quot;the notion that this is somehow the government taking over your medical decisions or options is like saying employers are taking over your medical decisions by shopping for a better health insurance plan -- it does affect you; but it is hardly a case of your employer taking over your decisions.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith regard to a single-payer health care system, Biles said a single-payer system -- sometimes known as &quot;Medicare for all,&quot; a term Baldwin has used -- could increase the number of health care providers available to patients, given that the vast majority of providers accept Medicare patients.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSofaer said that with the federal government paying for all health care, the government theoretically &quot;would have a huge amount of control over, in particular, what services were covered and which were not.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut &quot;in our form of government, with power divided in so many ways, I suspect it will be very difficult indeed for a federal program to be so authoritarian with respect to something as personal as medical care,&quot; she said. &quot;In practical terms, it would not happen.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThompson said Baldwin supports a law &quot;in which government will take over your decisions on medicine, on doctors and on hospitals.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe provides no evidence that Obama&rsquo;s health care reform law would bring about such a change, and offers only speculation that such a change would occur under a single-payer system.
