(The limit for couples is $250,000 in adjusted gross income.) Any profit from the house sale is not included in the income calculation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis limitation alone excludes the vast majority of homeowners. The nonprofit, pro-business <a href=\"http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/26200.html\">Tax Foundation estimated</a> in 2010 that this provision alone would make the new tax irrelevant to about 98 percent of families. It would only apply to those with the highest incomes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNext, it isn&rsquo;t a sales tax at all, because it applies only to the profit from the home sale, not the sales price itself.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThird, if the property you&#39;re selling is your primary residence -- and not a second home, vacation home or rental property -- you can turn a profit of $250,000 ($500,000 for couples) before the tax kicks in.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition, the tax is assessed only on the amount of profit that exceeds that limit. (<a href=\"http://www.realtor.org/press_room/news_releases/2012/01/ehs_dec\">The median sale price for a home in the U.S.</a> was $164,500 in December, 2011, one big reason why the vast majority of Americans won&#39;t be affected by the tax.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Other property, such as that second home, would incur the tax, but, again, your basic income has to be high enough for you to be hit.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe 3.8-percent tax is in addition to the existing capital gains tax that must be paid now. That rate is generally 15 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo consider a couple who sells their home for $1 million after buying it many years ago for $100,000.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf they earn $249,000 that year, they will pay no new tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf they earn $251,000, they will be taxed. Although the profit on the home sale will be $900,000, the first $500,000 is not taxed. They<em> will</em> have to pay 3.8 percent on the remaining $400,000, in addition to the usual capital gains tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe National Association of Realtors (Realtor.org) has an 11-page booklet, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.realtor.org/small_business_health_coverage.nsf/docfiles/government_affairs_invest_inc_tax_broch.pdf/$FILE/government_affairs_invest_inc_tax_broch.pdf\">The 3.8% Tax; Real Estate Scenarios &amp; Examples</a>,&quot; that outlines various scenarios and shows who will need to worry about the tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe chain e-mail claim that &quot;if you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8 percent sales tax&quot; &nbsp;is untrue on so many levels as to be ridiculous.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&#39;s not a sales tax because it doesn&#39;t apply to the full sale price of the home, only the profit made in the sale.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&#39;s not going to apply to the vast majority of Americans, only those whose income is more than $200,000 ($250,000 for couples).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&#39;s not going to apply to most people selling their home because they won&#39;t be getting $250,000 more than they paid for it ($500,000 for couples).<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause the e-mail wildly misrepresents one aspect of the new health care law, we rate it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\">Pants on Fire</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(Get updates from<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\"> PolitiFactRI on Twitter</a>.
