Dan Branch of Dallas, &quot;In 2005, Branch tried to expand third-trimester abortions in Texas!&quot; The blast said the change &quot;would have endangered disabled, unborn babies.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, it was an amendment to an amended amendment, and it would have provided an exception to an abortion restriction that didn&rsquo;t yet exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does that mean Branch &quot;tried to expand&quot; late-term abortions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Branch faces state Sen. Ken Paxton<strong> </strong>of McKinney in a<strong> </strong>May 27, 2014, runoff for the GOP nomination in the race to replace Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Backup: An amendment to an amendment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By email, Texas Right to Life legislative director John Seago pointed us to an <a href=\"http://www.journals.house.state.tx.us/hjrnl/79r/pdf/79rday69final.pdf#page=14\"><u>amendment</u></a> Branch offered May 16, 2005, as the House was considering <a href=\"http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=79R&amp;Bill=SB419\"><u>Senate Bill 419</u></a> to maintain the state medical regulatory agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the front of the House chamber, Republican Rep. Will Hartnett of Dallas put forward an amendment to<strong> </strong>the state&rsquo;s Occupations Code prohibiting third-trimester abortions &quot;when the abortion is not necessary to prevent the death of the woman.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hartnett&rsquo;s move--which won legislative approval and the backing of Republicans including Branch--amounted to a tightening of the existing <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/HS/htm/HS.170.htm\"><u>state law</u></a>, which barred third-trimester abortions unless the physician performing the abortion found the action &quot;necessary to prevent the death or a substantial risk of serious impairment to the physical or mental health of the woman; or the fetus has a severe and irreversible abnormality, identified by reliable diagnostic procedures.&quot; (That law was left in place, however, though the new restrictions superseded the old language due to a long-time <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.311.htm\"><u>legal provision</u></a> stating that when laws are irreconciliable with one another, the law of more recent enactment prevails.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During House consideration of his proposal, Hartnett amended it to bar third-trimester abortions if &quot;the viable unborn child does not have a severe, irreversible brain impairment.&quot; Branch then proposed adding &quot;or vital organ&quot; after &quot;brain:&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lboPpdgsWmW0MvW7_wuHWRf-x6amJmtzXqYv0PGem1844U-CDfc1fnr2AH5YH9moTS8EjTQjb3Kzgz-kzQD0bMnYSrH8w156vuq0sJ-igoaqsqY5vwveftAG99gPZbD8Sg\" style=\"height:133px; width:465px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recapping: Hartnett&rsquo;s amended amendment would allow late abortions if a &quot;viable unborn child&quot; had irreversible brain damage. Branch&rsquo;s amendment, which Hartnett opposed, would have added another exception, allowing third-trimester abortions if the viable unborn child<strong> </strong>had irreversible damage to vital organs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Branch offers rationale not mentioned in &#39;05 debate</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sought to interview Branch about why he offered his amendment. Branch campaign spokesman Enrique Marquez told us via email that Branch &quot;was concerned that, by focusing arbitrarily on the brain, to the exclusion of the heart or lungs, the Legislature might give a court an excuse to question the rational basis of the law.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Branch didn&rsquo;t explicitly mention potential court concerns in the House floor debate, according to the House&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://tlchouse.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=16&amp;clip_id=5485\"><u>archived online video</u></a> (debate on Branch&rsquo;s amendment starts at the 2:08:11 mark). But he<strong> </strong>repeatedly said it was rational to roll in irreversible vital organ damage if Hartnett&rsquo;s amendment already specified irreversible brain damage as an exception. Branch said, &quot;What this is merely attempting to do is to be intellectually honest with the fact that there are other vital organs besides the brain in a third-trimester fetus. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m trying to do.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Branch, saying he was &quot;strongly opposed as a general matter to third-trimester abortions,&quot; told the House, &quot;If you&rsquo;re going to have this exception for severe, irreversible brain damage, then my point is, as a son of a neurosurgeon, as a brother of a neurosurgeon, as someone who&rsquo;s lived through this with multiple children and multiple miscarriages, the term &lsquo;or vital organ&rsquo; merely says that the heart -- it acknowledges that the heart or the lack of lungs or the kidney or the liver are all also vital organs in addition to the brain.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Branch in debate: &#39;Pro-life position&#39;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After about 40 minutes of debate on his proposal, Branch said, &quot;I hope you understand I&rsquo;m coming from this in a pro-life position; I&rsquo;m really just trying to be careful and precise and intellectually honest. If we&rsquo;re going to make this exception for the brain, then we ought to include absolutely essential organs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hartnett, moving to table Branch&rsquo;s proposal, told House members that &quot;vital organ&quot; was too broad: &quot;I just think ... we&rsquo;re getting into the posture of trying to water it down by drip, drip, erosion,&quot; he said. &quot;You can live without a kidney is my understanding, you can live without a lung, you can live without just about anything except your brain, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re drawing the line at the brain.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The House tabled Branch&rsquo;s amendment before voting to adopt the Hartnett amendment and another that Hartnett offered requiring girls under age 18 to have a parent&#39;s permission before getting an abortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, both Hartnett measures were regarded as tightening abortion restrictions. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1okVAeizrrrAJU3_WmBo1v_KnVUTuGhq8BqDHHf2S6cU/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>News stories</u></a> from May 17, 2005, described the amendments as abortion limits, including a <em>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em> story that quoted Hartnett as saying, &quot;It&#39;s important for our (abortion laws) to be drawn tighter, rather than broader, to protect the children and to give these children an opportunity to be born.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Hartnett&rsquo;s measure tightened abortion limits; Branch&rsquo;s amendment would have added a second exception to one of them. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Groups diverge</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Returning to the present day: In the Texas Right to Life email, Texas Eagle Forum leader Cathie Adams and state Rep. Jodie Laubenberg, R-Parker, author of abortion restrictions that the Republican-led 2013 Legislature approved, are quoted as saying Branch&#39;s amendment would have expanded access to abortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, Joe Pojman, executive director of Austin-based anti-abortion group Texas Alliance for Life (which endorsed Branch on April 11, 2014), told us by email that his organization regards it as &quot;as highly misleading and disingenuous&quot; to say Branch tried to expand late-term abortions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pojman said neither Hartnett&rsquo;s fetal brain-damage exception nor Branch&rsquo;s vital-organ exception would have expanded third-trimester abortions because the existing restrictions -- which lawmakers left in place -- didn&rsquo;t significantly limit late abortions.<strong> </strong>&quot;Third-trimester abortions were effectively legal in Texas in 2005&quot; because of the mother&rsquo;s-mental-health clause, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas Right to Life said, &quot;In 2005, Dan Branch tried to expand third-trimester abortions in Texas.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TThis statement would hold up if Branch&#39;s amendment loosened established limits. To the contrary, lawmakers including Branch embraced specific restrictions superseding a broad limit stating that any fetus with a severe, irreversible abnormality could be aborted in the third trimester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Branch&#39;s proposal had been adopted, such abortions could have taken place if a fetus had a severe irreversible impairment to the brain or--Branch&rsquo;s wrinkle--another vital organ. The bottom line is Branch&rsquo;s proposal would have restricted such abortions more than they&#39;d been limited, which makes this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><em>FALSE </em></strong><em>&ndash; The statement is not accurate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click here for<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\"> <u>more</u></a> on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CLARIFICATION, <em>4:50 p.m., April 25, 2014</em></strong>: We added some details to the body of this article and revised the section on our ruling.
