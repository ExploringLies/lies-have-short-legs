Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, and a Culberson aide have visited the cemetery, he said, and veterans are there every day: &quot;If there was anything like that, they would be in an uproar. But no, it&rsquo;s a phony story.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Veterans&rsquo; families aren&rsquo;t restricted from practicing any religion, he said. &quot;It&rsquo;s their service; they can do any religious ceremony they want.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaders of Houston volunteer groups that were plaintiffs in the 2011 lawsuit gave us similar accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Everything is running very smooth there. There are no problems,&quot; said Cheryl Whitfield, director of National Memorial Ladies, whose 34 members sometimes are, she said, the only mourners during funerals at the<s> </s>cemetery. &quot;We attend all of the burials at Houston National Cemetery every day. There are anywhere from four to 12 a day. So we attend approximately 60 a week. And we give our condolences to the family,&quot; Whitfield told us by phone. &quot;We use God&rsquo;s name, we use Jesus&rsquo; name; we&rsquo;re able to say anything to help console the family.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her group finds out in advance about relatives&rsquo; wishes regarding religion&rsquo;s role in the funeral, she said. &quot;We pretty well know ahead of time if they have an issue with us saying &lsquo;God bless you&rsquo; or anything.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars district that brought the lawsuit, Bill Shaffer, told us by phone that he&rsquo;s been with <a href=\"http://www.txvfwdistrict4.com/\"><u>District 4</u></a> for about 16 years and knew of no such problems before or since the 2011 events. &quot;I know we&rsquo;ve had Jewish people, I know we&rsquo;ve had Muslims, we&rsquo;ve had Christian Science, Baptist, Catholic,&quot; he said. &quot;We adhere to whoever it is. That veteran deserves his last rites and we go along with whatever the family wishes, and I just hope that the government continues to do that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The VFW has been a Christian organization since its founding in 1899, he said, and the team from District 4 that provides funeral honors performs a ritual that can include a 21-gun salute, presentation of the American flag, a chaplain and prayers. &quot;It&rsquo;s up to them. Whatever part of the ritual they want, we do,&quot; he said. &quot;If they want the entire ritual, we do the entire ritual.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ForAmerica spokesman Appell, when informed that we&rsquo;d found no evidence Christian prayers were being prevented, told us the group &quot;believed the information to be current.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ForAmerica said the Houston National Cemetery &quot;is preventing&quot; Christian prayer at military funerals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group based its claim on recent online references to a congressman&rsquo;s claim in July 2011. We found no current restrictions or even proof that anyone was stopped from saying a Christian prayer in the past. To the contrary, volunteers and the current cemetery director told us Christian prayers are welcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate ForAmerica&rsquo;s statement as False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-08-06T19:02:14.111876", "ruling_date": "2013-08-06T18:07:24", "ruling_headline": "ForAmerica says Houston National Cemetery is preventing Christian prayers from being said at military funerals", "ruling_headline_slug": "foramerica-says-houston-national-cemetery-preventi", "ruling_link_text": "All religions welcome", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ForAmerica <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=579636002094762&amp;set=a.119506304774403.17273.114364638621903&amp;type=1&amp;ref=nf\"><u>image</u></a> posted on Facebook, July 11, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ForAmerica.org blog entry, <a href=\"http://www.foramerica.org/2013/07/us-military-under-attack-%E2%80%93-religious-liberty-in-the-armed-forces-attacked-from-within/\"><u>&quot;US Military Under Attack &ndash; Religious Liberty in the Armed Forces Attacked from Within,&quot;</u></a> July 11, 2013,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telephone interview with Mat Williams, cemetery director, Houston National Cemetery, Aug. 1, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JWIs4B6bVfDp_XjE5QLG2apghzYwwSgk2FZ2jD4lV5E/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>excerpted</u></a>, with ForAmerica spokesman Keith Appell, CRC Public Relations, Aug. 2, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breitbart.com, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/07/10/Report-Hostility-Toward-Christianity-Grows-In-The-Military\"><u>&quot;Report: Hostility Toward Christianity Grows in the Military,&quot;</u></a> July 10, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Family Research Council report, <a href=\"http://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF13G16.pdf\"><u>&quot;A Clear and Present Danger: The Threat to Religious Liberty in the Military,&quot;</u></a> July 9, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Houston Chronicle</em> news story, <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/VA-accused-of-censoring-religious-speech-at-2082330.php\"><u>&quot;VA accused of censoring religious speech at cemetery,&quot;</u></a> June 28, 2011<a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/VA-agrees-to-settle-censorship-lawsuit-at-Houston-2184259.php\"> </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Houston Chronicle</em> news story, <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/VA-agrees-to-settle-censorship-lawsuit-at-Houston-2184259.php\"><u>&quot;VA agrees not to censor prayer at Houston cemetery,&quot;</u></a> Sept. 22, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Houston Chronicle</em> news story, <a href=\"http://blog.chron.com/armedsources/2011/12/houston-national-cemetery-director-to-transfer-after-cesnorship-allegations/\"><u>&quot;Houston National Cemetery director to transfer after censorship allegations,&quot;</u></a> Dec. 12, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KHOU-TV news story, <a href=\"http://www.khou.com/news/Veterans-Celebrate-Compromise-that-Returns-God-to-National-Cemetery-132278423.html\"><u>&quot;Veterans celebrate compromise that returns &#39;God&#39; to National Cemetery,&quot;</u></a> Oct. 20, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas, <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/56424858/Rainey-v-Dept-Veterans-Affairs-5-11\"><u>temporary restraining order</u></a> in Rainey v.
