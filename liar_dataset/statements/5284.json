This budget represents a plan for allocating revenues and expenditures for the coming fiscal year, as well as for the next four fiscal years in more general terms. Each chamber is supposed to pass a version of the resolution, and if the two versions differ, then the chambers jointly hammer out a compromise and pass it.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tIf a budget resolution does not pass, the majority can adopt appropriations bills, which actually allocate money for specific purposes. But the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority&#39;s organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate.</em><br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tNeither the House of Representatives nor the Senate adopted a fiscal 2011 budget resolution, but the Republican-controlled House approved a fiscal 2012 budget resolution.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tThat gave Ryan more fuel for blasting the Senate Democrats for not adopting one.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tThe lack of budget resolutions contributed to delays in appropriations to government agencies, said <a href=\"http://www.taxpayer.net/about.php?action=staff#steve\">Steve Ellis</a>, a budget expert with <a href=\"http://www.taxpayer.net/\">Taxpayers for Common Sense</a>, a nonpartisan group that analyzes federal spending.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tEllis said no spending bills were approved for fiscal 2011 until after the fiscal year started in October 2010; the remainder weren&rsquo;t approved until April 2011, halfway into the fiscal year. For fiscal 2012, final spending bills weren&rsquo;t adopted until just before Christmas 2011, nearly three months into the fiscal year, he said.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tSo, when it lacks a budget for direction, Congress still has the power to spend money and keep government operating, but the process can get mucked up.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t<strong>Implications of no budget</strong><br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tDoes it matter? It does to some people.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tFailing to adopt a budget resolution &quot;is not a fiscal calamity,&quot; Ellis said, noting there are other methods to set budget levels and even with delayed spending bills the government keeps operating. &quot;But I would like the Senate and the House to do a budget resolution because that is going to get a better result than ad hoc or other mechanisms to get around it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tFrom Ryan&rsquo;s perspective, as he said in a <a href=\"http://budget.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=252148\">statement</a> in July 2011, Congress &quot;has a moral &mdash; and legal &mdash; obligation to propose and pass budgets that tackle our generation&rsquo;s greatest challenge.&quot; He added that &quot;America&rsquo;s job creators want certainty and confidence in the economy &mdash; which requires a credible plan to cut spending, prevent future tax hikes, and reassure our creditors that we&rsquo;re restoring fiscal discipline.&quot;<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tBut neither party can claim superiority on budget resolutions.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tSenate Democrats didn&rsquo;t pass a fiscal 2011 budget because &quot;Republicans were threatening to hijack the budget process and waste the American people&rsquo;s time with pointless political votes,&quot; a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/may/24/george-lemieux/george-lemieux-rips-sen-bill-nelson-senates-budget/\">told</a> PolitiFact Florida. &quot;Faced with this obstruction, we decided it would be a more productive use of the American people&rsquo;s time to move on and address other issues critical to middle-class families.&quot;<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tOur Florida colleagues also <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/may/24/george-lemieux/george-lemieux-rips-sen-bill-nelson-senates-budget/\">found</a>that since 1983, the House and Senate have failed to pass a joint budget bill on four occasions.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tFor fiscal year 2003, the Senate, under Democratic control in 2002, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind. On three other occasions (fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007), the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In these latter three cases, the Republicans were in the majority in both chambers of Congress.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tRyan said &quot;Senate Democrats have gone without any budget at all&quot; for 1,000 days.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tIt hasn&rsquo;t been quite that long since the last Senate budget resolution expired, but it has been 1,000 days -- and counting -- since the Democrat-controlled Senate adopted a budget.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tWe rate Ryan&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-01-31T18:44:11.537544", "ruling_date": "2012-02-02T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate has gone nearly three years without a budget, GOP Rep.
