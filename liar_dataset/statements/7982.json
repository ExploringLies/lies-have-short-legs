We asked Boehner&#39;s staff for a source to back it up.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThey did not have a source for the figure, but Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said: &quot;Regardless, it&rsquo;s clear the overwhelming majority of electricity in Ohio comes from the coal that the president is attacking.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn support of that statement, he cited a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/06/25/is-obama-waging-a-war-on-coal/\">Washington Post article</a> that looked at the question of whether Obama was waging a &quot;war on coal.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo how much of Ohio&#39;s electricity does come from coal?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.puco.ohio.gov/puco/?LinkServID=07FEA955-9818-B02E-9006A6E6834F7BA6\">Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO)</a> has a feature on its website that asks and answers the question.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Coal, a nonrenewable fossil fuel, is used to generate 77.87 percent of the electricity in Ohio,&quot; the PUCO site says.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPUCO says about 11 percent of Ohio electricity is generated by nuclear power, about 9.1 percent is produced using natural gas and other gases, and petroleum is burned to create steam to turn the turbine blades that generate about 1.0 percent of Ohio electricity. (PUCO lists as its source the Edison Electric Institute, EEI, the association of U.S. shareholder-owned electric companies.)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=OH\">U.S. Energy Information Administration</a> rounds the figure to 78 percent for electricity generated by coal.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat percentage is far higher than the <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/coal/\">42 percent of electricity</a> generated by coal nationally, according to the EIA.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur colleagues at the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/john-boehner-and-obamas-war-on-coal/2013/06/26/451b9f2e-deaf-11e2-963a-72d740e88c12_blog.html\">Washington Post Fact Checker</a> also examined Boehner&#39;s statement. In addition to citing the figures from PUCO, they noted that the latest figures show that Ohio cut its net generation of electricity from coal <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_03_07.html\">by about 10 percent</a> from 2010 to 2011.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFact Checker also took note of Ohio law, <a href=\"http://www.puco.ohio.gov/puco/?LinkServID=07FEA955-9818-B02E-9006A6E6834F7BA6\">cited by the PUCO</a> and <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=OH\">Energy Information Administration</a>, that is designed to reduce reliance on coal by requiring that at least 25 percent of all electricity sold in the state come from alternative energy sources by 2025. Half of that must come from renewable sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric power, geothermal and biomass.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBoehner&#39;s overall point was correct. As his spokesman said, the vast majority of Ohio&#39;s electricity does come from coal, and the percentage is far higher than the national average.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the state officially is looking to reduce, not maintain, its reliance on coal, and has made progress in the effort.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd while the percentage of electricity from coal is high, Boehner&#39;s figure of 95 percent exaggerates it by 17 percentage points. That&#39;s a significant difference.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOn balance, we rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-07-03T17:54:23.137323", "ruling_date": "2013-07-05T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "House Speaker John Boehner says almost all of Ohio\u2019s electricity comes from coal", "ruling_headline_slug": "house-speaker-john-boehner-says-almost-all-ohios-e", "ruling_link_text": "It\u2019s a lot, but he overstated it", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-08cd7038-a685-4937-54d4-51980108122b\">\r\n\tNew York Times, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/politics/obama-plan-to-cut-greenhouse-gases.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">Obama Outlines Ambitious Plan to Cut Greenhouse Gases</a>,&quot; June 25, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tHouse Speaker John Boehner, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.speaker.gov/video/boehner-president-obama-s-policies-undermining-job-growth-making-economy-worse\">President Obama&rsquo;s Policies Undermining Job Growth, Making Economy Worse</a>,&quot; June 26, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tEmail with Boehner press office, June 28 and July 1, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tWashington Post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/06/25/is-obama-waging-a-war-on-coal/\">Is Obama waging a &lsquo;war on coal&rsquo;?</a>,&quot; June 25, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tPublic Utilities Commission of Ohio, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.puco.ohio.gov/puco/?LinkServID=07FEA955-9818-B02E-9006A6E6834F7BA6\">Where does Ohio&rsquo;s electricity come from?</a>,&quot; accessed June 28, 2013</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\tU.S. Energy Information Administration, <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=OH\">Ohio energy profile</a>, July 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 13, "current_job": "Speaker of the House of Representatives", "false_count": 22, "first_name": "John", "half_true_count": 11, "home_state": "Ohio", "id": 49, "last_name": "Boehner", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "john-boehner", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-johnboehner.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/49/", "total_count": 69, "true_count": 17, "website": "http://www.speaker.gov/"}, "statement": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-08cd7038-a683-729a-29fb-921882aef9b5\" style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">\r\n\t&quot;About 95 percent of (Ohio&rsquo;s) electricity comes from burning coal.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a news conference", "statement_date": "2013-06-26", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 10, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/10/", "subject": "Energy", "subject_slug": "energy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 5, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/5/", "subject": "Environment", "subject_slug": "environment", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
