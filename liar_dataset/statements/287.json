Smaller donations get reported as a lump sum, and Obama has reported the most money raised under this category. (The donation limit for any individual donor is $2,300 per candidate.)\n</p>\n<p>\n An important caveat: The center has only analyzed data compiled through Sept. 30, 2007, the last deadline for campaign finance data.
