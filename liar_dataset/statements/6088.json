The website is managed by the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Responsive Politics.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe latest data on the Securities &amp; Investment industry includes figures released by the Federal Election Commission on June 4 -- two days before Kyrillos&rsquo; interview. The donations tallied on the website represent contributions of $200 or more from employees and political action committees within the industry.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to that data, Menendez has received nearly $1.4 million from the industry between 1989 and 2012. Menendez served as a congressman for 13 years before joining the Senate in 2006.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat amount puts Menendez in 15th place among the nation&rsquo;s 100 Senators for such donations, according to data on OpenSecrets.org. The 14 Senators with greater donations than Menendez include six Democrats, seven Republicans and one Independent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe leading recipient is former presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona), who has received about $11.2 million from the Securities &amp; Investment industry.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a statement, Menendez&rsquo;s campaign manager, Michael Soliman, pointed to the senator&rsquo;s &quot;long-standing record of championing common sense reforms that have sided with consumers over banks.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This silly partisan gotcha attack is absurd - by Joe Kyrlllos&rsquo;s own standard John McCain, Mark Kirk, Scott Brown and Mitch McConnell - four Republican senator&#39;s - are the real Kings of Raising Money from Wall Street,&quot; Soliman added, referring to other senators who have raised more money from the industry than Menendez.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs for Kyrillos, he has received his share of such donations as well.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to OpenSecrets.org, Kyrillos has received nearly $60,000 from the Securities &amp; Investment industry for his current campaign.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tChapin Fay, Kyrillos&rsquo; campaign manager, responded to our findings in a statement: &quot;You seem to be on a search to find anyway to find our statements not accurate and are missing the main point Senator Kyrillos made&mdash;Bob Menendez was cited as a top recipient of Wall Street money and Joe Kyrillos was not.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs the battle heats up for a U.S. Senate seat, Kyrillos claimed Menendez is &quot;the king of raising money from Wall Street, over a million dollars, one of the leaders in the United States Senate. I haven&rsquo;t raised any Wall Street money at all.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tData on OpenSecrets.org shows that Menendez has received nearly $1.4 million from the Securities &amp; Investment industry, putting him in 15th place among sitting Senators for such donations. That ranking means Menendez is one of the leading recipients, but it&rsquo;s an exaggeration to call him &quot;the king of raising money from Wall Street.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlso, Kyrillos is wrong about his own fundraising, because he&rsquo;s received nearly $60,000 from the industry for his current campaign, according to OpenSecrets.org.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/06/politifact_nj_kyrillos_slams_k.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-06-13T15:55:30.573793", "ruling_date": "2012-06-14T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "GOP U.S. Senate candidate Joe Kyrillos slams incumbent Robert Menendez over Wall Street donations", "ruling_headline_slug": "gop-us-senate-candidate-joe-kyrillos-slams-incumbe", "ruling_link_text": "Wall Street cash gets around", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNJToday, <a href=\"http://watch.njtvonline.org/video/2242868443\">Kyrillos Says He Will Beat Menendez in November</a>, June 6, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Star-Ledger, <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/06/sen_menendez_casts_primary_vot.html\">Sen.
