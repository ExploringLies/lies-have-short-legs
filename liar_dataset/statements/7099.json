State law allows that at bars as well as restaurants with liquor licenses.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd as Health First says, the Wisconsin law sets no age restriction.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it&rsquo;s important to note that establishments can decline, on their own, to serve parent-accompanied minors.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Wisconsin Tavern League doesn&rsquo;t tell its members how to handle it, but many are not comfortable serving the underaged, executive director Pete Madland said. Others do so.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMadland said it&rsquo;s an option for people who want to teach their children how to drink responsibly, a practice he noted is common in European countries with lower legal drinking ages.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>How does Wisconsin compare?</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe did not check on all 50 states because the available national research doesn&rsquo;t get to the level of state-by-state detail required to fully check this.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we didn&rsquo;t need to check all 50 to assess the group&rsquo;s Wisconsin-stands-alone claim.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found that many states allow parent-supervised underage drinking at home by their children. And a few allow underaged drinking by 18-20 year olds at bars if they are accompanied by parents or guardians.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat&rsquo;s at issue here is narrower: how many states allow underage imbibing at bars (and restaurants) at any age.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBased on our reporting, Wisconsin is not alone, though it appears to be a very short list.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLaws in Texas, Ohio and Montana closely mirror the law in Wisconsin.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Texas: I</strong>n many places in the Lone Star State, persons of any age can consume or possess alcohol in bars and restaurants when in the &quot;visible presence&quot; of their adult parent, legal guardian or spouse, according to the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUnlike in Wisconsin, those accompanied drinkers can&rsquo;t actually buy booze themselves. But their adult parent, guardian or spouse can buy it for them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It does happen,&quot; commission spokeswoman Carolyn Beck said of parent-supervised drinking in public places. They hear occasional complaints, especially in divorce situations in which someone objects to a former spouse getting alcohol for their child.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTexas has some &quot;dry&quot; counties and cities that prohibit some or all alcohol sales, but there&rsquo;s still a way for underage drinkers to tip one legally, Beck said. At private clubs in dry areas, adult members can get served and in turn can provide booze to their children, under the same law that applies at bars.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Ohio: </strong>Sales to underage drinkers are allowed if they are supervised by a parent, a spouse who is not an underage person, or a legal guardian. Tavern owners can allow underage drinking on premises if one of those persons gives the liquor or beer to the underage person and is present when they drink it, according to the Ohio Division of Liquor Control and state statutes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBartenders can refuse to serve these drinkers if they want to. As in Wisconsin, no minimum age is specified.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong> Montana:</strong> &nbsp;An exception to Montana&rsquo;s underage drinking law allows a person under 21 to receive a &quot;non-intoxicating quantity&quot; (less than 0.5 percent of alcohol by volume) from that person&rsquo;s parent or guardian. It doesn&rsquo;t rule out that happening in licensed drinking establishments. But it&rsquo;s a legal gray area because another law contradicts that and the exception is not clearly written. No minimum age is specified.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe state&rsquo;s Liquor Control Division suggests that minors not be served; the office is trying to change the law to rule out such sales on licensed premises.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo that&rsquo;s the quick tour.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Julia Sherman, coordinator for the <a href=\"http://law.wisc.edu/wapp/index.html\">Wisconsin Alcohol Policy Project</a> at the University of Wisconsin Law School, to describe Wisconsin&rsquo;s relative position among the states on this.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tShe said Wisconsin&rsquo;s statute is &quot;out of the mainstream&quot; in allowing drinking under such circumstances.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Ours is clearly extremely broad,&quot; Sherman said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut it doesn&rsquo;t stand alone.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA health advocacy group pushing to tighten up drinking laws said Wisconsin is &quot;the only state that allows parents or guardians to purchase alcohol for their children &ndash; regardless of whether that child is seven or 20 years old &ndash; at bars and restaurants.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe found less than a handful of states that allow that, but a few others do.
