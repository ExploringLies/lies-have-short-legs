David Cicilline, is concerned about the cost of education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a debate with his GOP challenger, Stan Tran, on the <a href=\"http://wpri.com/2014/07/31/newsmakers-gop-congressional-candidates-cormick-lynch-and-stan-tran/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>WPRI Newsmakers program that aired Aug. 3</u></a>, Lynch complained that college tuition and fees have gone through the roof over the past 36 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;College education has gone up 1,200 percent since 1978,&quot; he said. &quot;This isn&#39;t your parents&#39; college education. Students -- young students -- are issuing outrageous amounts of debt to go to college and get a degree, and the only thing the schools are guaranteeing them after that is a bill.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lynch said the injection of federal money is one of the reasons the costs have gone up so much. &quot;Education costs should not increase more than the rate of inflation.&quot; &nbsp;Critics have long argued that escalating government loan problems have pushed college costs higher and higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 1,200 percent increase means the cost of education is 13 times higher than in 1978.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That sounded high to us, so we thought we&#39;d check his statistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lynch said he based the number on <a href=\"http://www.fastcoexist.com/1681605/charting-the-insanely-high-and-rapidly-rising-cost-of-college#1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>an April 23, 2013 article</u></a> on the business website fastcoexist.com, where it says -- in a story and in a graphic -- that since 1979, public and private college costs have increased 1,120 percent. It&#39;s based on a report by Bloomberg and Business Week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lynch then added 33 percent a year for 2013 and 2014 and rounded it up to 1,200 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We confirmed the trend -- and got more up-to-date numbers -- by going to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It shows a 1,172 percent increase from July 1978 to June 2014, which rounds up to the amount cited by Lynch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lynch&#39;s problem: His statement doesn&rsquo;t account for inflation, which increased the cost of things we buy -- from a dozen eggs to a college education -- by 265 percent from 1979 to 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We confirmed the numbers by turning to <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_330.10.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>data from National Center for Education Statistics</u></a>, which looks at costs a bit differently using dollar amounts from the schools as far back as the 1963-64 school year. <a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2013menu_tables.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The latest statistics</u></a> cover the 2012-13 school year and look at costs with and without inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without inflation, the typical price tag for tuition and fees for the 1977-78 school year was $984. &nbsp;It was $10,683 for the 2012-13 school year -- a 985 percent increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when changes in the cost of living are taken into consideration, the typical $984 college bill for 1977-78 would now be about $3,636. Then the average bill for the 2012-13 school year ($10,683) would be 194 percent higher, not 1,200 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The inflation-adjusted increases were 147 percent for private or nonprofit four-year colleges and universities, 234 percent for public four-year institutions and 147 percent for public two-year colleges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Point of interest: At URI, tuition and fees for in-state students totaled $924 for the 1977-78 school year. The total for 2012-13 was $12,450, an increase of 277 percent if you adjust for inflation and 1,247 percent if you don&#39;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cormick Lynch said the cost of &quot;college education has gone up 1,200 percent since 1978.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He should have made it clear that he wasn&#39;t adjusting for inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His statement is only close to true if the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/household/2012/H08_2012.xls\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>median household income</u></a> had remained at $15,000 per year (<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/household/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>according to the U.S. Census Bureau</u></a>) and a loaf of bread was still 54 cents (as it was in 1978, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics</u></a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you adjust those tuition numbers for the rising cost of living, Lynch&#39;s percentage is six times too high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is accurate in the sense that college cost have increased many times faster than the cost of other things we buy. But it fails to account for inflation -- an important omission -- that would put the comparison in context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"> <u>Half True</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>PolitiFact Rhode Island</u></a> to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
