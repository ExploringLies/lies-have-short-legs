If there are, Murphy said, he hoped they would adhere to the shared revenue formula, which takes into account the higher level of poverty in Milwaukee versus cities such as Mequon.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThen Murphy declared:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Mequon and Milwaukee have the highest disparity of income in the country.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMequon is well known to be one of Milwaukee&rsquo;s most well-to-do neighbors. And for years Milwaukee has ranked among the nation&rsquo;s most impoverished cities -- a ranking reconfirmed by <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/103929588.html\">U.S. Census data released in September</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut in a nation filled with poor cities and wealthy suburbs, is the largest chasm really between Milwaukee and Mequon? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMurphy, <a href=\"http://city.milwaukee.gov/AldermanMurphysBiogr1918.htm\">a 21-year </a><a href=\"http://city.milwaukee.gov/AldermanMurphysBiogr1918.htm\">alderman</a> not known for hyperbole, cited U.S. census figures to back up his statement: Based on the most recent data, <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=dt&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G2000_B19101&amp;-tree_id=309&amp;-redoLog=true&amp;-geo_id=16000US5553000&amp;-parsed=true&amp;-search_results=04000US55&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en\">31.9 </a><a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=dt&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G2000_B19101&amp;-tree_id=309&amp;-redoLog=true&amp;-geo_id=16000US5553000&amp;-parsed=true&amp;-search_results=04000US55&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en\">percent</a> of Milwaukee families had incomes of less than $25,000 and <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=16000US5551150&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR3&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-_sse=on\">1.9 </a><a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=16000US5551150&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR3&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-_sse=on\">percent</a> of Mequon families did.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a gap of 30 percentage points.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen asked about his statement by PolitiFact Wisconsin, Murphy said: &quot;I can&rsquo;t imagine there&rsquo;s anywhere in the country that beats that.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot the strongest start when it comes to research methodology.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;If I&rsquo;m wrong,&quot; Murphy added, &quot;I&rsquo;ll be happy.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOK. Let&rsquo;s find out.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMurphy told us he was referring to big cities and suburbs that share a border. That&rsquo;s an unconventional way to look at it -- for instance, it includes Mequon, in Ozaukee County, but not River Hills in Milwaukee County. But we&rsquo;ll start there.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor the numbers, Murphy used 2009 figures for Milwaukee and 2006-2008 numbers for Mequon -- cities its size are not updated as frequently as Milwaukee.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe can make a better comparison -- between Milwaukee and Mequon, and between other U.S. cities and their suburbs -- by using 2006-2008 census figures for all of them.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThose figures show <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=16000US5553000&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR3&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-_sse=on\">27.5 </a><a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=16000US5553000&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR3&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-_sse=on\">percent</a> of Milwaukee families had incomes of less than $25,000. That means the gap between Milwaukee and Mequon was 25.6 percentage points.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s our marker, as we look at other communities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe didn&rsquo;t look at every major U.S. city and its suburbs. But with just a few checks -- focusing on cities near Milwaukee on the income scale -- we found two city-suburb combinations that had larger income gaps.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIn Cleveland, <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=16000US3916000&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR3&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-_sse=on\">36.2 percent</a> of families had incomes of less than $25,000. In neighboring Shaker Heights, the figure was <a href=\"http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=16000US3971682&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR3&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-_sse=on\">7.8 percent</a>.

Using those numbers, we looked at each community in Milwaukee, Ozaukee and Waukesha counties.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<font>In Milwaukee, 31.9 percent of families earned less than $25,000 and in Mequon the figure was 3.7 percent.</font></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<font>But the gap was even larger between Milwaukee and six other suburbs, all in Waukesha County: Chenequa (3.3 percent), North Prairie (3.2 percent), Town of Delafield (3.2 percent), Wales (3 percent), Genesee (2.8 percent) and Merton (2.7 percent). </font></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<font>O</font>f course, Murphy was making a national comparison. And the approach he used was just one way of looking at income disparity in a region.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn an <a href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu/eti/2010/PovertyRecessionDrilldown.pdf\">October 2010 study</a>, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee researcher Lois Quinn looked at 55 metropolitan areas and what percentage of the poor residents in each -- those with income below the federal poverty level -- lived in the major city. For Milwaukee, 73.2 percent of the area&rsquo;s poor residents were in the city.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn contrast, Lincoln, Neb., was home to 94 percent of that metro area&rsquo;s poor. Several others, based on the data available, also had higher percentages.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing a different measure, median income, a <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/%7E/media/Files/Programs/Metro/state_of_metro_america/metro_america_report.pdf\">2010 </a><a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/%7E/media/Files/Programs/Metro/state_of_metro_america/metro_america_report.pdf\">study</a> by the Brookings Institution also cited Milwaukee as among the metro areas with high city-suburb income disparity -- but again not the highest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn Milwaukee, Cleveland and Detroit, the gap in median income between the city and its suburbs reached nearly $30,000 in 2008, the study said. But <font>the gap reached $40,000 between two Connecticut cities -- Hartford and Bridgeport -- and their </font><font>suburbs. </font></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<font>To</font> be sure, the city&rsquo;s poverty rate is among the highest in the nation -- a stubborn statistic that has defied efforts by policymakers and politicians to change it. But in neither measure was the city&rsquo;s disparity gap at the top.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOK, enough numbers. What do they show us?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn making a point about how state shared revenue should be distributed to cities, Milwaukee Alderman Michael Murphy said the largest income disparity in the country is between Milwaukee and Mequon. While comprehensive studies have ranked Milwaukee near the top in income disparity, Murphy went too far in lining Milwaukee up against neighboring Mequon.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWith just a little checking, we found two city-suburb combinations that have a larger disparity. Murphy said he&rsquo;d be happy if proven wrong, since that would mean Milwaukee doesn&rsquo;t have the worst income disparity.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPut a smile on your face, alderman: We rate your statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-11-10T21:15:24.463775", "ruling_date": "2010-11-12T09:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Milwaukee Alderman Michael Murphy says Mequon and Milwaukee have the highest income disparity in the country", "ruling_headline_slug": "milwaukee-alderman-michael-murphy-says-mequon-and-", "ruling_link_text": "The gap is big, but there\u2019s not much methodology to the alderman\u2019s madness", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBrookings Institution, <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/%7E/media/Files/Programs/Metro/state_of_metro_america/metro_america_report.pdf\">State of Metropolitan America</a>(page 136), 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Alderman Michael Murphy, comments at Common Council budget meeting (afternoon session), Nov. 5, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Alderman Michael Murphy, interviews, Nov. 5 and 8, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Common Council, Alderman Michael Murphy <a href=\"http://city.milwaukee.gov/AldermanMurphysBiogr1918.htm\">biography</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Common Council, <a href=\"http://city.milwaukee.gov/AldermanMurphysCommi1920.htm\">Alderman Michael Murphy committee assignments</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/103929588.html\">Milwaukee now fourth poorest city in nation</a>, Sept. 28, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, University of Wisconsin-Madison Institute for Research on Poverty assistant researcher Joanna Young Marks, Nov. 9, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail and phone interviews, University of Wisconsin-Madison Institute for Research on Poverty senior editor Deborah Johnson, Nov. 8 and 9, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUniversity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Employment and Training Institute, <a href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu/eti/2010/PovertyRecessionDrilldown.pdf\">Drilldown on Poverty and the </a><a href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu/eti/2010/PovertyRecessionDrilldown.pdf\">Recession</a> working paper, October 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Employment and Training Institute senior scientist <a href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu/eti/QuinnHome.htm\">Lois Quinn</a>, Nov. 10, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Census Bureau, various family income comparisons<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview, Wisconsin Demographics Services Center research analyst David Egan-Robertson, Nov. 5, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Member of Milwaukee Common Council", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Michael", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Wisconsin", "id": 837, "last_name": "Murphy", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "michael-murphy", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Michael_Murphy_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Wisconsin", "edition": "Wisconsin", "edition_slug": "wisconsin", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 8, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Wisconsin Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/8/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/837/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://city.milwaukee.gov/district10"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Mequon and Milwaukee have the highest disparity of income in the country.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "comments made during adoption of Milwaukee's 2011 city budget", "statement_date": "2010-11-05", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 184, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/184/", "subject": "Income", "subject_slug": "income", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
