But we know of no campaign contribution promise made during that campaign like the one cited by One Wisconsin Now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we posed that to Scot Ross, the group&rsquo;s executive director, he argued Walker&rsquo;s 2006 promise &quot;has never been repudiated in subsequent campaigns.&quot; And he said Walker &quot;did the opposite&quot; of the 2006 pledge by accepting large campaign donations during the time he worked on state budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But<strong> </strong>a campaign promise from an unsuccessful run doesn&rsquo;t automatically carry over to the next campaign. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And One Wisconsin Now ignores the fact<strong> </strong>Walker&rsquo;s old promise specifically said it applied to the 2007 budget period.
