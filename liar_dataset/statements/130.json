They did not have an appointment and Clinton was not in the office.\n<p>\n A story on the conservative Web site NewsMax reported that the women were unhappy with \"the outright shabby treatment shown them by the former First Lady... She and her staff simply refused to meet with them.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n That claim was picked up in an\n <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/goldstaremail/\">\n  e-mail\n </a>\n that circulated in 2001 and has gotten new life since Clinton became a presidential candidate. The e-mail says that \"None other than the Queen herself, Hillary Rotten Clinton ... refused repeated requests to meet with the Gold Star Mothers.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n Shirley Jones, the legislative chairman for the group in 2001 and one of the women who stopped by Clinton's office, says the e-mail is wrong. She said she sent Clinton a letter requesting a meeting and has since met with her four times. Clinton even sponsored a bill on behalf of the Gold Star Mothers.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"As a mother she was very understanding,\" Jones says. \"I felt she was very supportive &mdash; and I'm a Republican.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n The Gold Star Mothers Web site says the allegation in the e-mail is incorrect. \"This story passed through several people before being reported by NewsMax on May 26, 2001 and the details were lost ... The NewsMax article did not get the story correct and we deeply regret the misunderstanding about Senator Hillary Clinton.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n So we give the e-mail a False.\n</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-01-07T13:28:34.423093", "ruling_date": "2007-10-20T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "She has met with them four times", "ruling_headline_slug": "she-has-met-with-them-four-times", "ruling_link_text": "She has met with them four times", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "American Gold Star Mothers,\n<a href=\" http://www.goldstarmoms.com/agsm/FAQs/FAQs.htm#Hillary\">\n Hillary Rumor Not True\n</a>\n<p>\n NewsMax.com,\n <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20010611090536/http://www.newsmax.com/showinside.shtml?a=2001/5/26/73332\">\n  Hillary Snubs Gold Star Mothers\n </a>\n Mary 26, 2001\n</p>\n<p>\n BreakTheChain.org,\n <a href=\"http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/goldstar.html\">\n  All That Glitters\n </a>\n Oct. 17, 2001\n</p>\n<p>\n The Politico,\n <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1007/6314.html\">\n  Untraceable e-mails spread Obama rumor\n </a>\n Oct. 15, 2007\n</p>\n<p>\n Albany Times Union, Clinton smooths out Gold Star flap, Aug. 3, 2001\n</p>\n<p>\n Clinton news release,\n <a href=\" http://www.senate.gov/~clinton/news/statements/record.cfm?id=234279\">\n  Senator Clinton Introduces Legislation to Provide Special Pension to Parents of Servicemen and Servicewomen Killed During War\n </a>\n July 2, 2004\n</p>\n<p>\n Interviews with Philippe Reines, spokesman for Sen.
