Scott Walker&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-makes-57-vetoes-signs-68-billion-wisconsin-budget-b9944038z1-213757881.html\"><u>signature</u></a> June 30, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the shouting continues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State <a href=\"http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/hansen/Pages/default.aspx\"><u>Sen. Dave Hansen</u></a> (D-Green Bay) protested after the Associated Press reported that a GOP real-estate agent wrote to Walker about buying state office buildings while the Legislature considered Walker&rsquo;s budget -- which <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/legislators-back-broad-scott-walker-authority-to-sell-state-property-b9915418z1.html\"><u>ended competitive bidding</u></a> for such sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The ink on the budget wasn&rsquo;t even dry,&quot; Hansen claimed in a July 19, 2013 <a href=\"http://wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=301545\"><u>news release,</u></a> &quot;before one of these wealthy Republican donors was angling for a sweetheart deal from a political party that appears all too eager to reward their friends.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hansen included an income-tax break and an expanded voucher-school program<strong> </strong>among the &quot;rewards,&quot; but it was a health-care claim on Hansen&rsquo;s list that caught our eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GOP budget, he said, included a move &quot;forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance that could cost them as much as $4,000 per year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, by Hansen&rsquo;s calculation, the state budget means low-income people will be pushed into the private market and find themselves spending fully one-third of their income on health care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hansen is talking about Walker&rsquo;s controversial decision to reject the federal Medicaid expansion and instead require some 90,000 poor people to get coverage from the new private insurance marketplaces, known as exchanges, under Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Critics, including Democrats such as Hansen, said that despite federal subsidies a chunk of those people would not be able to afford private insurance from the exchanges. Currently, those people have very limited out-of-pocket costs under the state&rsquo;s BadgerCare Plus health program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hansen, in his blast at the budget, puts a hard number on the challenge facing some people with his $12,000/$4,000 scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two numbers are familiar to experts who track how the Obamacare exchanges will work in Wisconsin. At an income of $12,000 -- just above the federal poverty line of $11,490 -- an individual<strong> </strong>will no longer be eligible for state BadgerCare coverage and will have to move into the federal exchanges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $4,000 is a worst-case scenario figure for out-of-pocket costs in the exchanges for a family of two with a household income of up to 200 percent of the official federal poverty level, notes Jon Peacock, research director at the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a liberal advocacy and research group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Hansen muffs the illustration using the two figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One big problem is he mixes an income level for one person with the costs facing a household of two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A single person with an income of $12,000 would pay about $240 a year in insurance premiums, and if serious health problems arise could pay up to an additional $2,100 in out-of-pocket costs (deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance), said Peacock and Sonya Schwartz, a member of the research faculty at Georgetown University&rsquo;s Center for Children and Families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That adds up to a possible total outlay of almost $2,400 -- one-fifth of the cited income -- not the $4,000 or one-third that Hansen says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No small change in either case, but it makes for a big difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of final notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The $4,000 cost figure Hansen cites could come into play for married couples, for instance, but only if their combined income was above $15,510 -- higher than the $12,000 Hansen cites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people who would be moved from BadgerCare, though, would be single parents with custody of a child. The child would stay on BadgerCare, however. The &nbsp;maximum costs for a parent who is right at the poverty level would be around $2,400. They jump up to over $4,000 for a single parent making $30,000, Peacock said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Hansen&rsquo;s specific example is significantly off the mark -- and that&rsquo;s especially problematic because he&rsquo;s talking about the worst-case scenario to begin with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hansen sought to highlight the biggest impact on a group of poor people when he said the Republican move will have the effect of &quot;forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance that could cost them as much as $4,000 per year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Hansen errs in the example and significantly overstates the effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate his claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-07-25T16:16:16.934999", "ruling_date": "2013-07-26T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Wisconsin Sen.
