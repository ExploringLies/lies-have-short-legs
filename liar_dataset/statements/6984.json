And what we&rsquo;ve said is let&rsquo;s change those certifications. The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work. And as a consequence, veterans&rsquo; unemployment is actually now lower than general population. It was higher when I came into office.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe wondered if Obama had his statistics correct.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe looked at data on veterans&rsquo; employment compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We focused on two categories of veterans -- all veterans, as well as those who have specifically served in the post-Sept. 11, 2011, armed forces. While Obama didn&rsquo;t specify what type of veterans he was referring to, the context suggests he was referring to post-9/11 veterans.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The statistics for all veterans</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Unemployment rate for all veterans, January 2009</em>: 7.4 percent<br />\r\n\t<em>Unemployment rate for the general population, January 2009</em>: 7.8 percent<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama had said veteran unemployment was higher than the general population when he came into office, so by this measurement, he&rsquo;s wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Unemployment rate for all veterans, September 2012</em>: 6.7 percent<br />\r\n\t<em>Unemployment rate for the general population, September 2012</em>: 7.8 percent<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama had said veteran unemployment is now lower than the general population, so on this measurement, he&rsquo;s right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>The statistics for post-9/11 veterans only</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans, January 2009</em>: 8.9 percent<br />\r\n\t<em>Unemployment rate for the general population, January 2009</em>: 7.8 percent<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama had said veteran unemployment was higher than the general population when he came into office, so by this measurement, he&rsquo;s right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans, September 2012</em>: 9.7 percent<br />\r\n\t<em>Unemployment rate for the general population, September 2012</em>: 7.8 percent<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama had said veterans unemployment is now lower than the general population, so on this measurement, he&rsquo;s wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Tallying the results</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, whichever measure you use, Obama&rsquo;s formulation was half-right.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe should also note, as we have in the past, that presidents do not necessarily have a large impact on either rising or falling unemployment, since the nation&rsquo;s labor market is sufficiently big and dynamic to be shaped by multiple factors beyond just presidential policies. However, presidential policies may have a bigger impact on employment among veterans than on other types of workers, since the Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies have specific policies aimed at boosting veterans&rsquo; employment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama said, &quot;Veterans&rsquo; unemployment is actually now lower than (the) general population. It was higher when I came into office.&quot; Whether you&rsquo;re talking about all veterans or just those who served after 9/11, Obama gets one number right but one number wrong. So we rate his claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-23T00:28:17.740907", "ruling_date": "2012-10-23T00:24:21", "ruling_headline": "Barack Obama touts his record on improving employment for veterans", "ruling_headline_slug": "barack-obama-touts-his-record-improving-employment", "ruling_link_text": "The stats show Obama's partially right", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBarack Obama, transcript of the third presidential debate in Boca Raton, Fla., Oct. 16, 2012</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, search form for &quot;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab5.htm\">Table A-5.
