As a governor, I thought please, give me this program. I can run this more efficiently than the federal government, and states, by the way, are proving it. States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these -- these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively&quot; than the federal government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDid the federal government get a more efficient Medicaid program in Rhode Island by giving it to the state to run?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe idea is certainly in line with Romney&#39;s philosophy for health-care coverage. He objects to a nationally administered program such as Obamacare but favors comparable programs if they are run individually by the states, such as the program he adopted in Massachusetts. And Romney has also <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82782.html?hp=l11\">advocated a block grant system</a> in which Medicaid would be turned over to states to run as they see fit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo let&#39;s start with some background.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMedicaid is a health-care program for the poor, financed by federal and state money. In Rhode Island, the federal government reimburses 52 cents of every dollar spent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe money is distributed by states under rules set by the federal government. States have limited latitude on how the money is spent and require a &quot;waiver&quot; if they want to bend or break the rules.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn Jan. 16, 2009, in the final days of the Bush administration, the federal government granted a sweeping &quot;global waiver&quot; to Rhode Island at the request of Republican Gov. Donald Carcieri. It allowed Rhode Island to, for example, move people out of nursing homes into less-expensive community-based care. It also gave the state more power to make unilateral changes to the Medicaid program. In return, the state agreed to foot the bill if costs increased above a pre-determined ceiling over the next five years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut here&#39;s the important point for the purpose of this fact check: the waiver didn&#39;t, by any measure, completely turn the administration of Medicaid over to Rhode Island. There are still lots of federal strings attached.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo contrary to the impression debate viewers might have gotten from Romney&#39;s comment, Rhode Island is not a case study in what happens if you make Medicaid a block grant program and turn control over to a state.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt does, however, illustrate what can happen when a state gets more flexibility and officials are committed to improving medical care for the poor.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo did the 2009 &quot;global waiver&quot; produce a more-efficient program?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSeveral factors complicate the issue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, the deal gave Rhode Island federal money for things the state was previously paying for by itself, such as early intervention for at-risk children. It saved money for the state, but not the federal government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSecond, some of the efficiencies that occurred were initiated before the waiver was granted; in other cases, the waiver wasn&#39;t needed to implement them. For example, a large drop in expensive nursing-home use came the year before the waiver took effect.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn other words, other states could achieve those efficiencies under the existing federal program.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause of that, the degree of efficiency, as measured by how much money was saved, is also a complicated -- and debated -- question.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGary Alexander, who was secretary of health and human services when the waiver was approved, <a href=\"http://www.galen.org/assets/RIMedicaidReform.pdf\">published a pape</a>r with the conservative Galen Institute, pegging the savings at $110 million over 18 months, or $73 million a year.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Romney campaign cites the Alexander paper as evidence that Rhode Island saved money.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3428#_ftn8\">issued a report</a> saying Alexander was wrong because any savings actually resulted from more than $400 million Rhode Island received in federal stimulus money in 2009 and the shifting of some costs previously paid by the state to the federal government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRhode Island&rsquo;s current Health and Human Services secretary, Steven Costantino, asked The Lewin Group, a consulting firm, to do a less-partisan analysis after Carcieri left. <a href=\"http://www.ohhs.ri.gov/documents/documents11/Lewin_report_12_6_11.pdf\">According to that group&#39;s estimates</a>, the waiver itself saved $23 million over three years, or $7.6 million annually, Costantino said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition, the deal also provided a $42.7-million windfall for the state over the same three years because the federal government started sharing the costs of some health services, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTotal savings per year: just under $22 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo put this in perspective, a savings of $73 million a year (the high number cited by Alexander) is less than 4 percent of the state&rsquo;s annual $2 billion Medicaid budget; $22 million would be 1.1 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(Costantino told us another $32 million was saved over three years thanks to the improvements to the program that the state made without the waiver.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMitt Romney said Rhode Island took its federal Medicaid money and demonstrated that the state could run the program more cost-effectively than the federal government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn context, his statement suggests that the federal government turned over control of the program to Rhode Island. That&#39;s not the case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInstead, the state got a waiver from federal rules through a program designed to let states experiment with better ways to provide health care for the poor. That allowed Rhode Island to continue to realign and streamline the program, saving millions.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven without the waiver, there&#39;s evidence that the state would have saved money because it was already inaugurating reforms on its own.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe degree of savings is debatable, but Romney never cited an amount.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBecause his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\"> Mostly True</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>(Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/PolitiFactRI\">@politifactri</a>.
