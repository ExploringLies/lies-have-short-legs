Well, we&rsquo;re not going there, my friends. I&rsquo;m telling you right now, we&rsquo;re going to write fairer rules for the middle class and we are going to raise taxes on the middle class.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Wait what?&quot; the videos continues, before playing the damning sentence in slow motion: &quot;We are going to raise taxes on the middle class.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Wait, what?&quot; was the reaction of the Clinton campaign too. Spokesman Josh Schwerin told us Clinton actually said the exact opposite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He pointed to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnJHarwood/status/761297801447821312\">numerous</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samsteinhp/status/761299207202467841\">reporters</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danmericaCNN/status/760247775200182273\">who</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/761203908949803008\">agreed</a> and forwarded us a <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/updates/2016/08/01/in-omaha-hillary-clinton-touts-100-day-jobs-plan/\">transcript</a> of Clinton&rsquo;s prepared remarks that reads, &quot;We <strong>aren&rsquo;t</strong> going to raise taxes on the middle class.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a classic case of she-heard-he-heard, so we asked experts to arbitrate. They agreed with the Clinton camp and offered some technical evidence to prove it. Get ready for some science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Yu, a linguistics professor at the University of Chicago who specializes in phonology, ran the audio through a computer program called <a href=\"http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/\">Praat</a>, which analyzes phonetics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By analyzing the sound waves, we can see that Clinton was saying &quot;aren&rsquo;t,&quot; because she definitely pronounced the &quot;n,&quot; though she didn&rsquo;t really hit the &quot;t.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of the results:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lUTEUmYRSgmmKEzvKf_UFBNwCtox5N9gTZ6b0a9A1WCu0Koitg8gLxgAaYq39bLMQ0ud1Q7lVZPjZPe6scNuq1IFNwjv9N2lm9kcgriiGl8U2sxK9jzms8RuyZXIXeMHrSiH-myq\" style=\"border:none; height:352px; width:624px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, the phoneme (unit of sound) highlighted in pink is an &quot;n,&quot; though there&rsquo;s not a &quot;t.&quot; That still suggests she was trying for the word &quot;aren&rsquo;t.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is pretty common for people to not release the final &lsquo;t in word-final -nt clusters and is definitely not likely for someone to release the &lsquo;t&rsquo;in a three-consonant sequence like &lsquo;ntg&rsquo; in &lsquo;aren&#39;t going,&rsquo;&quot; Yu told us. &quot;In any case, since she did pronounce the &lsquo;n&rsquo; in &lsquo;aren&#39;t&rsquo;, it is clear that she produced the negated form of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics)\">copula</a> &lsquo;are.&rsquo;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Edward Flemming, a linguistics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also ran the audio through Praat and came up with the same results. But even if we didn&rsquo;t have Praat, he said, context alone sways the argument in the Clinton camp&rsquo;s favor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Also if she was going to say &lsquo;we are going to&rsquo;, wouldn&rsquo;t she contract it to &lsquo;we&rsquo;re&rsquo;, as she does a few words earlier?&quot; Flemming pointed out. &quot;To my ears, it is clear that she is saying &lsquo;aren&rsquo;t&rsquo;.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/01/12/investing-in-america-by-restoring-basic-fairness-to-our-tax-code/\">Clinton&rsquo;s tax plan</a>, by the way, does not change the tax rates for the middle class and instead targets the wealthy through small reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Trump campaign said, &quot;Hillary Clinton says &nbsp;she wants to, &lsquo;raise taxes on the middle class.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the transcript, numerous reporters, experts and a computer program, Clinton said the exact opposite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Pants on Fire!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-05T11:34:54.486204", "ruling_date": "2016-08-05T12:34:23", "ruling_headline": "Donald Trump wrongly says Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes on the middle class", "ruling_headline_slug": "donald-trump-wrongly-says-hillary-clinton-wants-ra", "ruling_link_text": "Phonetic analysis says otherwise", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Team Trump, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq8X0mbhJGw\">Hillary Clinton Says She Wants to &quot;Raise Taxes on the Middle Class</a>,&rsquo;&quot; Aug. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillary Clinton, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/updates/2016/08/01/in-omaha-hillary-clinton-touts-100-day-jobs-plan/\">In Omaha, Hillary Clinton Touts 100-Day Jobs Plan</a>,&quot; Oct. 1, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Josh Schwerin, Clinton campaign spokesman, Aug. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Alan Yu, linguistics professor at the University of Chicago, Aug. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Edward Flemming, &nbsp;linguistics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Aug. 4, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Trump", "barely_true_count": 134, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 210, "first_name": "Donald", "half_true_count": 92, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1019, "last_name": "Trump", "mostly_true_count": 72, "name_slug": "donald-trump", "pants_count": 91, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_TRUMP_CAMPAIGN_5.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1019/", "total_count": 645, "true_count": 29, "website": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;Hillary Clinton says she wants to, &lsquo;raise taxes on the middle class.&rsquo; &quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign video ", "statement_date": "2016-08-04", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 41, "current_job": "Presidential candidate", "false_count": 31, "first_name": "Hillary", "half_true_count": 69, "home_state": "New York", "id": 1, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 76, "name_slug": "hillary-clinton", "pants_count": 7, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/GYI_659046701_585968470.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1/", "total_count": 304, "true_count": 72, "website": "http://www.hillaryclinton.com/"}], "twitter_headline": "Phonetic analysis proves Donald Trump wrong on Clinton tax quote"}
