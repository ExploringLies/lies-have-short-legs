(Wealth being assets such as savings and retirement accounts, minus liabilities such as credit card debts and what&rsquo;s unpaid on a home mortgage.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact National <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/31/bernie-s/sanders-says-walmart-heirs-own-more-wealth-bottom-/\">in 2012</a>, PolitiFact Wisconsin <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/08/one-wisconsin-now/just-how-wealthy-wal-mart-walton-family/\">in 2013</a> and PolitiFact Virginia <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2016/mar/14/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-walmart-heirs-are-wealthier-bo/\">in 2016</a>, each arrived at a rating of True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In those fact checks, we considered six people as being the Walton family.

Here is their wealth, according to &quot;real time&quot; estimates by the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/list/?ss=forbes400\">Forbes 400</a> on the day Sanders made his claim:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/jim-walton/?list=forbes-400\">Jim Walton</a> (son): $35.1 billion<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/s-robson-walton/?list=forbes-400\">S.

Charitable donations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wealthy people often designate a substantial portion of their assets to be donated to charity upon their death. Those funds are not subject to the estate tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Koren gave this example: If $100 billion of the total $132 billion were designated for charity, the estate tax owed would be $13 billion, not $53 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that some assets could be shielded by tax avoidance techniques, Viard said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Trump&rsquo;s other proposal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to proposing a repeal of the estate tax, Trump has proposed to repeal a tax rule that, if approved, would result in the Walton heirs paying more in capital gains taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, under Trump&rsquo;s plan, there wouldn&rsquo;t be an estate tax -- under which taxes must be paid essentially right away -- but an increase in capital gains taxes, which don&rsquo;t have to be paid until assets are sold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is impossible to know exactly how much of a capital gains tax the Waltons would face under Trump&rsquo;s proposed change, but it could be tens of billions of dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, unlike the estate tax, the next generation of Waltons could defer paying the capital gains tax for as long as they hold onto the assets they inherit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders says Trump&rsquo;s plan to repeal the estate tax would mean the Walton family would &quot;get a $53 billion tax break.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the collective wealth of seven Sam Walton descendants, they could face a tax of about $53 billion under the current estate tax law. But that amount is based on estimates of their wealth and it would be reduced based on any charitable donations the family members might arrange for upon their death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Trump also proposes higher capital gains taxes, which could amount to a tax bill of tens of billions for the Walton heirs -- although that tax wouldn&rsquo;t be imposed until they sell assets such as Walmart stock</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a claim that is partially accurate but needs more information, our rating is Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b9673993-3e57-4e72-a28f-a546f1e4376e\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b9673993-3e57-4e72-a28f-a546f1e4376e</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-10-13T18:35:07.599017", "ruling_date": "2016-10-17T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Bernie Sanders says Donald Trump plan to end estate tax would give $53 billion break to Walton heirs", "ruling_headline_slug": "bernie-sanders-says-donald-trump-plan-end-estate-t", "ruling_link_text": "Many unknowns", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>YouTube, WisconsinEye <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Nbtx8CHoE8\">video</a> (36:30) of Bernie Sanders speech, Oct. 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internal Revenue Service, <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-tax\">&quot;Estate tax,&quot;</a> Oct. 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview, <a href=\"http://law.wisc.edu/profiles/hserlang@wisc.edu\">Howard Erlanger</a>, emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, Oct. 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Texas Tech University Law School professor <a href=\"http://www.professorbeyer.com/\">Gerry Beyer</a>, Oct. 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Tax Policy Center Sol Price fellow <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/author/roberton-c-williams\">Roberton Williams</a>, Oct. 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Bernie Sanders campaign spokesman Warren Gunnels, Oct. 5, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/scholar/alan-d-viard/\">Alan Viard</a>, tax policy scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, Oct. 6, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email, Holland &amp;
