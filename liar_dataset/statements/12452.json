But is he also right about their differences on carbon tax and climate change?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that Sanders&rsquo; rhetoric on climate change and his plan to deal with it are aggressive and, unlike Clinton, he has advocated for a carbon tax. Clinton does, however, have a climate change plan. While some environmentalists have said it isn&rsquo;t tough enough, others have given it positive reviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the Sanders and Clinton campaigns referred us to each candidate&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/climate/\">climate change plan</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders&rsquo; <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/climate-change/\">plan</a> is long and comprehensive. Beyond a tax on carbon, it includes an array of proposals from banning certain drilling and mining practices to improving the national public transit system. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/climate/\">plan</a> is shorter and, though it doesn&rsquo;t include a tax on carbon, contains similar provisions on renewables.

Clinton, who played a role in negotiating the Paris climate change agreement,&nbsp;herself touted her goals for more solar panel and clean electricity as &quot;big&quot; and &quot;bold.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton has gotten her best reviews from the League of Conservation Voters, who endorsed Clinton last fall (<a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/11/10/3721205/grassroots-questions-big-green/\">to some controversy</a>). The green group considers Clinton&rsquo;s plan strong and aggressive and, more importantly, achievable, Tiernan Sittenfeld, its senior vice president of government affairs, told PolitiFact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Hillary is focused on practical solutions,&quot; Sittenfeld said, pointing out that there are many lawmakers in Congress who still deny climate change science. &quot;So (a carbon tax) is pretty remote possibility.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But some are skeptical of Clinton&rsquo;s &quot;boldness.&quot; Pulitzer Prize-winning website InsideClimate News <a href=\"http://insideclimatenews.org/carbon-copy/27072015/hillary-clinton%E2%80%99s-climate-policy-ambitious-falls-short-bold-democratic-primary\">called</a> Clinton&rsquo;s plan ambitious but said it &quot;falls short of bold.&quot; The <em>Washington Post</em>&rsquo;s editorial board <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-climate-change-plan-2015-7\">said</a> her ideas are &quot;second best.&quot;&nbsp;Environmental news magazine Grist <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-hillary-clinton-and-climate-change/\">summed</a> up her positions as not bad but &quot;not quite the climate hawkishness we need.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders said, &quot;I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change.
