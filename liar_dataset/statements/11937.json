Kelly Ayotte against her challenger, Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/21075705-95/scalias-death-adds-new-dimension-to-presidential-new-hampshire-senate-races\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Ayotte almost immediately backed</u></a> Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell&rsquo;s pledge not to take action on a Supreme Court nominee until after the election of the next president. And the state&rsquo;s Democratic Party was quick to criticize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Feb. 16, news release, <a href=\"http://nhdp.org/blog/2016/02/16/nhdp-release-on-supreme-court-confirmation-ayotte-kowtows-to-far-right-forgoes-constitutional-duty-ignores-people-of-new-hampshire/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the party put it this way</u></a>: &quot;Fearing discontent from her far-right base and pressure to appease her party bosses, Senator Kelly Ayotte has rejected her constitutional duty and decided to back Mitch McConnell&rsquo;s controversial decision to block the Senate from giving fair and timely consideration to President Obama&rsquo;s next Supreme Court nominee -- a move that would leave the nation&rsquo;s highest court with an unprecedented year-long vacancy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While much of that statement is political boilerplate, we were interested in the last clause -- that refusing to bring up any Obama nominee would lead to an &quot;unprecedented year-long vacancy&quot; on the court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to check it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked for comment, the state Democratic Party directed us to two news stories. The first was <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/02/14/466723547/7-things-to-know-about-presidential-appointments-to-the-supreme-court\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>an article from NPR that noted</u></a> the longest time a Supreme Court nominee waited to receive a vote. That was in 1916, when Louis Brandeis waited 125 days. And a quick look at the calendar reminds us that Obama has more than 300 days remaining in office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those are interesting numbers, and certainly suggest that if the Senate refuses to act on Obama&rsquo;s nomination, there would be an unprecedented wait for a vote. But that&rsquo;s not what the party&rsquo;s press release said. It referred to a &quot;vacancy&quot; on the court itself, which is different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later in the same NPR article, which cites the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Congressional Research Service</u></a> as a source, it&rsquo;s said that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt\"><em>&quot;The longest vacancy on the Supreme Court was 27 months between the Tyler and Polk administrations before the Civil War. Tyler, derided as &lsquo;His Accidency,&rsquo; because he was the first vice president elevated to the White House, also holds the distinction of a record eight nominees rejected or withdrawn.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tyler actually had <a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2016/02/13/ample-precedent-for-rejecting-supreme-court-nominees/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>another Supreme Court seat open up</u></a>, and that one took more than 400 days to fill on its own. Taking those two openings from 1843 and 1844 into account, it certainly looks like a yearlong wait for a justice to be seated has precedence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The party also pointed to <a href=\"http://time.com/4224348/scalia-vacancy-supreme-court/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>an article on the </u><u>Time</u><u> magazine website</u></a>. This article, however, says that since the Supreme Court has had nine members -- going back to 1869 -- the court went 391 days without a ninth justice in 1969 and 1970. Over that time, the Senate <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/nominations/Nominations.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>rejected two nominations</u></a> from President Richard Nixon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So while this article indicates that a yearlong vacancy on the court would be unusual, it wouldn&rsquo;t be unprecedented. Even restricting our view of the court to its existence as a nine-member panel, it has spent one lengthy span -- less than 50 years ago -- without a ninth justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is one way in which McConnell&rsquo;s threat would be unusual. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/feb/17/misleading-notion-supreme-court-vacancy-hasnt-been/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>As PolitiFact noted this week</u></a>, it would be unheard of for the Senate to spend more than a year without acting on a Supreme Court nomination after such an appointment is made. In the past, extended vacancies on the court resulted from nominees being rejected sequentially, rather than not acted upon at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New Hampshire Democratic Party said that not confirming a Supreme Court nominee from President Obama &quot;would leave the nation&rsquo;s highest court with an unprecedented year-long vacancy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the lack of Senate vote on an actual nominee would indeed be unprecedented, there are at least three examples of a seat in the Supreme Court going unfilled for more than a year, one of them within the last half century. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts. We rate the statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-19T13:25:56.588041", "ruling_date": "2016-02-19T13:25:16", "ruling_headline": "New Hampshire Democratic Party says a one-year vacancy on Supreme Court would be unprecedented", "ruling_headline_slug": "new-hampshire-democratic-party-says-one-year-vacan", "ruling_link_text": "There's precedent", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><a href=\"http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/21075705-95/scalias-death-adds-new-dimension-to-presidential-new-hampshire-senate-races\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Scalia&rsquo;s death adds new dimension to presidential, New Hampshire Senate races,&quot;</u></a> <em>Concord Monitor</em>, Feb. 16, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://nhdp.org/blog/2016/02/16/nhdp-release-on-supreme-court-confirmation-ayotte-kowtows-to-far-right-forgoes-constitutional-duty-ignores-people-of-new-hampshire/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;On Supreme Court Confirmation, Ayotte Kowtows to Far Right, Forgoes Constitutional Duty &amp;
