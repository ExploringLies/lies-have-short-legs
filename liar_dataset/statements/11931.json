And so there&rsquo;s a duty to fill that vacancy, to make the system work.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Our constitutional system depends on nine members serving on the Supreme Court, which is why there has never been a vacancy in the last, I think, 30 years lasting longer than 237 days. The president has 339 left.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered if Blumenthal was correct, and why he was limiting his analysis to the past 30 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the Supreme Court&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/members_text.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>list of justices and their terms</u></a>, we counted the gap between the date each justice left office and the date their successor was sworn in, beginning with justices who were on the bench in 1900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found Blumenthal&#39;s 237-day gap. It began when Lewis F. Powell Jr. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/supcourt/stories/powell062787.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>retired on June 26, 1987</u></a>. It took nearly eight months to find a replacement. Ronald Reagan&#39;s first choice, Robert Bork, was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/politics/24REAG.html?pagewanted=all\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>rejected</u></a> by the Democratic&nbsp;Senate, mostly along party lines. His second choice, Douglas Ginsburg, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/supcourt/stories/powell082698.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>withdrew after admitting</u></a> he used drugs, both as a college student and later as a professor at Harvard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anthony Kennedy, Reagan&#39;s third choice to fill Powell&rsquo;s seat, was confirmed without opposition by the Senate on Feb. 3, 1988. He was sworn in Feb. 18, 1988.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found a longer vacancy, though it falls outside of Blumenthal&#39;s 30-year window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Justice Abe Fortas resigned on May 14, 1969, 391 days passed before his successor, Harry Blackmun, was sworn in on June 9, 1970. That was nearly 46 years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, a Republican president -- in this case, Richard Nixon -- <a href=\"http://www.cqpress.com/incontext/SupremeCourt/controversial_nominations.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>failed to get his first two nominees</u></a> approved by the Democratic-controlled Senate, although neither vote was on strict party lines. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like Kennedy, <a href=\"https://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal70-1292788\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Blackmun was confirmed without dissent</u></a>. Blackmun&nbsp;ultimately became one of the most liberal justices on the court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In all, of the 59 vacancies that occurred in the 20th and 21st centuries, only four persisted longer than 200 days. Six were between 150 and 200 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The average time between a justice&#39;s departure and his successor being sworn in: 73 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two things to note. Justices don&#39;t always get sworn in as soon as they are&nbsp;confirmed. John Hessin Clarke was <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/MJC/places/jhClarke.asp\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>approved by the Senate on July 24, 1916</u></a>, but he wasn&#39;t sworn in until nearly three months later. Also, justices sometimes announced their resignations months before they step down from the bench, so their departures could take effect <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/members_text.aspx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the day before or the same day</u></a> a successor is sworn in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of the 237-day gap cited by Blumenthal, Powell is listed as leaving the court <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/supcourt/stories/powell062787.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the day he announced</u></a> his resignation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blumenthal was talking about the length of vacancies, not the gap between an announced departure and the swearing-in of a new justice. And on his specific timeline, he is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate it True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-02-18T10:55:24.184322", "ruling_date": "2016-02-18T14:00:01", "ruling_headline": "Sen.
