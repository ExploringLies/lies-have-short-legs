But when compared with federal highway spending, Amtrak&rsquo;s balance sheet doesn&rsquo;t look so bad, according to Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), a major proponent of rail transportation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Last year we spent more than $40 billion on highways. And Lord knows we need that. But that&#39;s more than we spent on Amtrak in its entire 40-year history,&quot; Lautenberg said in an article on nola.com, the online home of the New Orleans Times-Picayune.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCan it be that after 40 years of operation the money spent on Amtrak didn&rsquo;t even equal one year of federal highway spending? PolitiFact New Jersey found the claim is right on track.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDoug Hecox, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration in Washington, DC confirmed that highway spending for Fiscal Year 2010 (Oct. 1, 2009 to Sept. 30, 2010) exceeded $40 billion. Highway spending generally increases a small amount each year for inflation, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy comparison, Caley Gray, Lautenberg&rsquo;s communications director, said Congress has spent $37.9 billion on Amtrak from Fiscal Year 1971 to Fiscal Year 2011, according to Amtrak.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s a bit more than Amtrak&rsquo;s total, but it supports Lautenberg&rsquo;s statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In the forty years of Amtrak&rsquo;s existence, the Federal government has invested a total of $36 billion in the Amtrak system &ndash; a figure that represents both operating and capital funding,&quot; Amtrak President and CEO Joseph H. Boardman said in Amtrak&rsquo;s General and Legislative Annual Report to Senate President Joseph Biden Jr. and House Speaker John Boehner. Amtrak&rsquo;s Comprehensive Business Plan for Fiscal Year 2012 was included with the report dated Feb. 7. &quot;Between 1971 and 2008, by contrast, the Federal government has invested more than $421 billion in aviation and over a trillion dollars in the nation&rsquo;s highways.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tRod Diridon, executive director of the Mineta Transportation Institute in San Jose, Calif., suggested that Lautenberg wasn&rsquo;t dismissing the need for highway funding, but pointing to other transportation needs for the nation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;His statement is accurate and I think his intent is to indicate that &ndash; certainly not to denigrate the highway system, but to note the world is in transition now, to move away to petroleum-based transportation to electrically based transportation.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDiridon didn&rsquo;t suggest people give up their vehicles, but said having an upgraded electric rail system can have many benefits: efficiency in moving people, less reliance on foreign oil and reduced environmental impact.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLautenberg touched on those points as well as increased ridership in a July 5 letter sent to Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) supporting Amtrak&rsquo;s $2.2 billion funding request for Fiscal Year 2012. Murray is chairman and Collins is a ranking member on the Appropriations Committee for Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies. Lautenberg and 19 other U.S. senators signed the letter.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAmtrak got $1.41 billion in assistance for its nearly $3.9 billion budget, said Clifford Cole, media relations manager for Amtrak Media Relations/Government Affairs in New York.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an article about expanding rail routes and access in Louisiana, Lautenberg said Congress spent more than $40 billion on highways last year, more than has been spent on Amtrak in the national rail system&rsquo;s 40-year history. The Federal Highway Administration confirmed the highway spending figure, as did Amtrak in a letter requesting $2.2 billion in federal assistance for its Fiscal Year 2012 budget.
