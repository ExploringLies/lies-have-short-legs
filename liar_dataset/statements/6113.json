However, the most widely accepted number comes from the Pew Hispanic Center, which&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2011/02/01/unauthorized-immigrant-population-brnational-and-state-trends-2010/\">estimated</a>&nbsp;that there were 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the United States in 2010.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo it&rsquo;s mathematically impossible for more than 43 percent of all food stamps to be given to illegals -- there simply aren&rsquo;t enough undocumented immigrants in the country to make the math work. Nor does the math work if you choose a month before the number of food stamp recipients rose due to the recession. In October 2008, there were 30.8 million recipients; 43 percent of that number is 13.2 million, which exceeded the total number of illegal immigrants at the time, 11.6 million.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNone of this even takes into account an even more basic reality: It is against the law for <a href=\"http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/rules/Legislation/pdfs/Non_Citizen_Guidance.pdf\">Illegal immigrants to receive food stamps</a> and the government has a process to verify immigration status. Citizen children of illegal immigrants can qualify (there are 3.5 million, <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2011/02/01/iii-births-and-children/\">according to Pew</a>) but that&#39;s not enough to make the math work.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIs it possible some illegal immigrants receive food stamps anyway? Sure. But even if every single one somehow managed to fool the government, it still wouldn&#39;t be enough to account for the 43 percent.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe first of the Facebook post&rsquo;s 10 claims -- that &quot;more than 43 percent of all food stamps are given to illegals&quot; -- is ridiculously false. It isn&rsquo;t mathematically possible given the number of illegal immigrants in the United States, and it ignores the fact that illegal immigrants can&rsquo;t even receive food stamps legally.
