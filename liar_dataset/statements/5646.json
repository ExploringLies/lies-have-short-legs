We decided to check if Santorum is right about how the law is currently polling.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>First, the law itself</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe law, commonly referred to as Obamacare, is a massive legislative package that seeks to extend health coverage to all Americans. The individual mandate is the centerpiece, requiring all Americans to have insurance, either through their employers, private plans or government programs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe contacted Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, and Robert Blendon, a Harvard University professor who studies health care polling.

If Santorum was speaking about the mandate only, the polls show opposition (and much of it strong).&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut both our experts were more measured about the extent of opposition to the entire law.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBowman noted that Americans like many sections of the law, such as the provision that allows children to remain on their parents&rsquo; health plan until age 26 and another that prohibits companies from denying coverage because of a pre-existing condition.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The verdict on the law is not overwhelmingly negative, though in most polls it tilts negative,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBlendon said, &quot;Santorum isn&rsquo;t completely wrong with his claim because some of these polls show a majority of Americans not supporting the overall health care bill or the individual mandate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSantorum wrote that, &quot;Polls show Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to Obamacare, especially the individual mandate.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe consulted several recent polls and found that, in broad terms, opinion on the health care law is more unfavorable than favorable, but not overwhelmingly. As Bowman said, it &quot;tilts negative.&quot; But it&#39;s also worth noting that four of the most recent polls show stronger opposition than when we have ruled on similar statements in the past.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObjection to the individual mandate, however, is resounding. Some polls found approval rates in the low 30s and disapproval in the high 60s.
