Indeed, Holloway says media coverage of the issue has <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/115072209.html\">diminished his </a><a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/115072209.html\">chances</a> to win the contest.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHolloway and his wife, Lynda, own 15 parcels in the city, including several apartment buildings on the near north side. Some of the buildings have been the subject of numerous and repeated building code violations.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHolloway was ordered to Milwaukee Municipal Court because a large batch of the violations have not been corrected. That hearing, involving dozens of long-standing violations, is set for March of 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBeyond that, a security guard at one building faces misdemeanor <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/114932229.html\">charges</a> for accusing him of threatening a tenant who was at odds with Holloway; another tenant faces <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/noquarter/114695814.html\">charges</a> of trashing that same tenant&rsquo;s apartment; and <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/noquarter/114912349.html\">reports</a> show more than 800 police calls to Holloway-owned buildings in the past two years.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo ears perked up at a candidate <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/MPTV1036#p/u/1/UGGBD2yBUpM\">forum</a> at the Marquette University Law School when Holloway -- who was serving as acting county executive at the time -- was asked about his record as a landlord. He compared the dire economic situation facing some of his tenants with the economic woes facing the state and county government, then described the problems.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The code violations are primarily storm windows,&quot; Holloway said, adding &quot;which we take and provide plastic which is better than storm windows.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe added: &quot;And it has to do with tuckpointing, which is all complete.&quot; And he said: &quot;Within the households, it&rsquo;s fine.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFinally, he declared: &quot;I&rsquo;m saying I have resolved these problems. We are working to resolve these problems.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThis one is easy enough to check.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe looked at the city&rsquo;s online <a href=\"http://isdweb1.ci.mil.wi.us/cgi-bin/Iscola.dll?colaid=biadmin&amp;sid=7215603&amp;colaseq=13900&amp;formid=biownerp&amp;btnownerp=Yes&amp;Owner=000083342\">database</a> available through the Department of Neighborhood Services. Each violation for each property is listed. We counted, and then counted again.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt the time he made the statement, Holloway had 200 outstanding violations on eight of his 15 properties. Some of the violations were new -- and written up on Jan. 21, 2011, the same day as the candidate forum.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDo they all relate to exterior issues, such as brickwork, as Holloway claimed?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNo.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome examples of properties and violations listed:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<a href=\"http://isdweb1.ci.mil.wi.us/cgi-bin/Iscola.dll?colaid=biadmin&amp;sid=7215603&amp;colaseq=105425&amp;formid=biinspct&amp;Taxkey=2452305000&amp;btninspct=Yes\">2061 W.

All of those -- and more -- are interior issues. There&rsquo;s even a note about faulty fire extinguishers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat seems appropriate.
