Kemp and  MacGinnitie are the only Republican candidates in the July 20 primary. <br /><br />Kemp,  who spent four years as a state senator, has made a point during the  campaign that he is the more experienced candidate, Phillips said. Kemp  served in the Georgia Senate from 2003 to 2006. Gov. Sonny Perdue  appointed Kemp as secretary of state in January after Karen Handel  resigned to run for governor. MacGinnitie was elected to the Sandy  Springs City Council in 2007. <br /><br />\"I don't think you can convince  voters that you're the best candidate because you've been around the  longest,\" Phillips said.<br /><br />But does four years in the Georgia  Legislature and five months as secretary of state constitute a \"career  politician\"? The MacGinnitie campaign says yes, if you add Kemp's failed  bid to become state agriculture commissioner in 2006 and that Kemp  considered a run for the Georgia Senate in 2007. Phillips' argument: How  do you run for agriculture commissioner and run for a job as vastly  different as secretary of state four years later?<br /><br />\"You couldn't  find a more extreme example of going from one extreme to another. ... I  just don't see how you do that and say you are not a career politician,\"  Phillips said.<br /><br />Kemp, 46, however, has been a developer and in  the real estate business since he graduated from the University of  Georgia in 1987. Even when he served in the Legislature, Kemp (drawing  an annual government salary of about $17,000) maintained his interest in  the development game. Last year, Kemp started a manufacturing business,  campaign officials said. He claims a net worth of nearly $6.3 million.  Kemp will make about $120,000 this year as secretary of state and about  $100,000 from his business interests, said his campaign manager, Tim  Fleming.<br /><br />\"I would consider someone a career politician who's  served 20 or 30 years,\" Fleming said.<br /><br />Most of the people we  talked to agreed with the Kemp camp.<br /><br />When he thinks of career  politicians, University of Georgia political science professor Charles  Bullock considers Georgians like U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, U.S. Rep.  Jack Kingston, U.S. Rep. John Lewis and U.S. Rep. John Linder. The four  men have spent an average of 17.5 years in Congress.<br /><br />\"Four years  is an awfully short time to constitute a career unless these are dog  years,\" Bullock said in an e-mail.<br /><br />Bob Holmes, who served 34  years as a Democratic state representative, thought the combination of  Kemp's four years in the Legislature and now two subsequent campaigns  since 2002 shows \"some truth\" to the MacGinnitie campaign's claim. <br /><br />\"What  he's done in the past decade ... indicates he wants to be in politics  for the rest of his career,\" said Holmes, a retired Clark Atlanta  University professor.<br /><br />So is Kemp a \"career politician\"? Well, the  average length of service for a U.S. senator is 12.9 years and a member  of the U.S. House of Representatives is 11 years, according to  Congressional Research Service. Many of those elected officials held  elected posts before going to Washington. Perdue, a former state  senator, has spent 19 years as an elected official. Lt. Gov. Casey  Cagle, a former state senator, is finishing his 16th year as an elected  official. Then there is Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin, who's been  in office since 1969. Kemp is building a political resume, but two  terms in the Legislature, a failed bid for Irvin's job and this campaign  don't add up at this point. We rate Doug MacGinnitie's claim as False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-06-18T14:10:22.517749", "ruling_date": "2010-06-20T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Candidate calls opponent a \"career politician\"", "ruling_headline_slug": "candidate-calls-opponent-career-politician", "ruling_link_text": "Career politician charge doesn't stand the test of time.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Telephone interviews with MacGinnitie campaign manager Brandon Phillips,  June 10 and 11, 2010.<br /><br />Telephone interview with Kemp campaign  manager Tim Fleming, June 10, 2010.<br /><br />E-mail from Tim Fleming, June  11, 2010.<br /><br />Brian Kemp financial disclosure <a href=\"http://www.ethics.georgia.gov/Reports/Financial/Financial_Details.aspx?FilerID=F2006000086\" target=\"_blank\">form</a>, May 3, 2010.<br /><br />Telephone  interview with Center for Public Integrity reporter Josh Israel, June  10, 2010.<br /><br />Congressional Research Service, Membership of the 111th  Congress, A <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40086.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Profile</a>.<br /><br />E-mail  from University of Georgia professor Charles Bullock, June 10, 2010.<br /><br />E-mail  from Georgia Senate press coordinator Jennifer Kitt, June 10, 2010.<br /><br />Telephone  call from city of Sandy Springs, June 10, 2010.</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Sandy Springs City Councilman", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Doug", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 459, "last_name": "MacGinnitie", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "doug-macginnitie", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/dougmacginnitie.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/459/", "total_count": 2, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp is a \"career politician.\"</p>", "statement_context": "a campaign flier", "statement_date": "2010-06-06", "statement_type": {"id": 3, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/3/", "statement_type": "Attack", "type_description": "<p>\r\n\tA criticism of a candidate.</p>\r\n"}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 137, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/137/", "subject": "Public Service", "subject_slug": "public-service", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Secretary of State", "false_count": 3, "first_name": "Brian", "half_true_count": 1, "home_state": "Georgia", "id": 460, "last_name": "Kemp", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "brian-kemp", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/briankemp.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Georgia", "edition": "Georgia", "edition_slug": "georgia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 5, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Georgia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/5/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/460/", "total_count": 8, "true_count": 4, "website": ""}], "twitter_headline": null}
