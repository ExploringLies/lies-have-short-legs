David Cicilline and Anthony Gemma, who is challenging Cicilline in the 1st Congressional District Democratic primary, the topic turned to possible ways of cutting the federal deficit.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCicilline, i<a href=\"http://www.wpri.com/dpp/news/local_news/providence/bonus-cicilline-gemma-answer-questions\">n the WPRI-TV/Providence Journal debate, </a>&nbsp;urged a swift return of U.S. troops from Afghanistan as one suggestion, noting that &nbsp;&quot;We will spend $100 billion in Afghanistan this year, fixing roads, building bridges, training police officers, and more [and] cutting the same things in our own country.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHis message was clear: it is time for the United States to start redirecting that money toward improving America&rsquo;s own crumbling infrastructure -- a theme Cicilline has been sounding for months.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we wondered if the United States was really spending $100 billion a year for Afghan infrastructure and other non-military aid. We called Cicilline campaign for its supporting evidence and while we waited for a response, did some research.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPolitiFact National examined the subject of non-military aid to Afghanistan in May 2012 when it looked at whether President Obama had kept a campaign promise to increase that aid by another $1 billion to $3 billion. (PolitiFact rated it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/166/increase-non-military-aid-to-afghanistan-by-1-bil/\">Promise Kept.)</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne source of information PolitiFact National cited was a <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL30588.pdf\">May 2012 Congressional Research Service report,</a>which found that during fiscal years 2001 through 2011-- a span of a decade -- &quot;the Afghan intervention has cost about $443 billion, including all costs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor fiscal year 2012, which ends Sept. 30, the report says, the United States was expected to spend &quot;about $90 billion&quot; for military operations and another &quot;$16 billion in aid,&quot; including training and equipment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat&rsquo;s far different from $100 billion going to just to infrastructure and non-military projects in one year, as Cicilline seemed to be implying.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAccording to a <a href=\"http://www.sigar.mil/pdf/quarterlyreports/2012-07-30qr.pdf\">July quarterly report of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction</a>, which keeps a running tab of the war&rsquo;s costs for Congress, &quot;the President&rsquo;s FY 2013 budget request includes nearly $9.7 billion to strengthen the Afghan security forces during this critical transition period and to fund programs to build governing capacity, promote economic development, and counter the drug trade.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe special inspector general&rsquo;s report also includes <a href=\"http://www.sigar.mil/quarterlyreports/fundingtables/\">a graphic</a>which shows that between 2002 and March of 2012, &quot;the United States had appropriated approximately $89.48 billion for relief and reconstruction in Afghanistan.&quot; &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe money had been allocated into five major areas:<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t$52.15 billion for security</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t$22.34 billion for governance and development</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t$6 billion for <a href=\"http://www.sigar.mil/quarterlyreports/fundingtables/counter-narcotics.html\">counter narcotics efforts</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t$2.37 billion for humanitarian aid</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t$6.62 billion for oversight and operations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an e-mail, Michael O&rsquo;Hanlon, director of research and a senior fellow for foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, said the U.S. would spend &quot;more than $100 billion&quot; in Afghanistan this year &quot;but it&rsquo;s primarily for our own military forces and their military operations.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOf that $100 billion about $15 billion &quot;can be viewed as directly supporting the Afghan economy and Afghan institutions and infrastructure,&quot; O&rsquo;Hanlon said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUltimately the Cicilline camp responded.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn an e-mail, spokeswoman Nicole Kayner told us the congressman&rsquo;s quote was accurate because of two barely audible words that viewers likely missed last week and the four judges here at PolitiFact had to have replayed a half dozen times to actually pick up: &nbsp;&quot;and more.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCicilline, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and should be able to articulate well the difference between military and non-military aid, said the United States &quot;will spend $100 billion in Afghanistan this year fixing roads, building bridges, training police officers AND MORE [and] cutting the same things in our own country.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKayner said that statement is &quot;factually accurate&quot; because &quot;Our country is spending over a 100 billion dollars a year on roads, bridges, training police officers AND MORE in Afghanistan.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe stress of debates can prompt a candidate to misspeak and mumble at times, especially when it becomes a slugfest of accusations like last week&rsquo;s first televised Cicilline-Gemma get-together.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut we believe anyone who watched the debate last week would have had the impression that Cicilline wasn&rsquo;t talking about the cost of tanks and soldiers and running a war when he raised the $100 billion figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe was talking specifically about redirecting money now spent on Afghanistan&rsquo;s infrastructure and using it on things we&rsquo;re cutting &nbsp;&quot;in our own country&quot; -- our own crumbling roads and bridges.
