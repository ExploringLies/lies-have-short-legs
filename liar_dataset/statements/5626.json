Chris Smith, a Democrat who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, wants to rewrite the law because he fears its protections are too broad. Smith wants to change the law so that it only applies in cases that take place in a home, car or at work. He also wants to prohibit the use of &quot;stand your ground&quot; in cases where the shooter has provoked a confrontation, Smith said in a March 21 <a href=\"http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/broward/blog/2012/03/sen_chris_smith_wants_to_revam.html\">press release</a> sent by the Senate Democratic office.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;This law has been a double-edged sword,&quot; said Smith, who was the House Democratic leader in 2005 when &quot;stand your ground&quot; passed.

From 2006-10 -- the first five full years after &quot;stand your ground&quot; became law -- law enforcement agencies reported an average of 36 justifiable homicides committed by civilians. Average to average, the number of justifiable homicides by civilians is now three times higher than it was in the years before 2005. That&rsquo;s an increase of 200 percent. (We excluded 2005 from this calculation because the law went into effect part way through the year.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Is &lsquo;stand your ground&rsquo; to blame?</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo Smith is a little high in his estimate using FDLE data. Next, we wondered whether the 2005 law is the reason justifiable homicides among civilians are up.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tExperts we contacted didn&rsquo;t agree whether there is a simple cause and effect.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University, has researched how the FBI and police departments define justifiable homicide.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCriminologists are suspicious of sharp increases or decreases within a short time frame, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I don&rsquo;t believe anything triples.&hellip;Increases that sharp are probably due to some artificial cause like a shift in how people are defining events,&quot; Kleck said. &quot;It&rsquo;s possible nothing actually changed in frequency except police departments increasingly defined homicide claimed to be defensive as a justifiable homicide. &hellip; Local police departments are increasingly viewing alleged defensible homicide as falling into the UCR definition. I don&rsquo;t think they are trying to rig data, they honestly shifted their perceptions of what qualifies.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBill Eddins, state attorney in Florida&rsquo;s 1st Circuit and president of the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association, said he couldn&rsquo;t conclude if there is a correlation between the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law and the increase in justifiable homicides.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAlthough our overall crime rate has trended downward, &quot;the random violence seems to be increasing to me,&quot; Eddins said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo determine the effect of the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law would require examining how many times the statute was used, the result of the case and whether or not the &quot;stand your ground&quot; statute contributed to that resolution, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There is no real measurement set up to do that at this point. I cannot reach the conclusion that there is a direct correlation in the increases of justifiable homicide as a result of stand your ground law. I know other people are saying you can, but I can&rsquo;t reach it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNancy Daniels, a public defender in the 2nd Circuit and president of the Florida Public Defender Association, said that she thinks there is a clear correlation between the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law and increase in justifiable homicide cases.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The types of incidents involved in &lsquo;stand your ground&rsquo; cases have always been with us, but some now are found to be justifiable,&quot; she said in an email. &quot;And who knows how many people have been emboldened to think violence is justified just because of the new law?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDennis Kenney, a criminal justice professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and a former police officer in Polk County, said that determining correlation between the numbers and the law would require examining the cases and seeing how often elements from the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law were raised. Without examining the numbers or the cases themselves, Kenney said it&rsquo;s &quot;highly likely&quot; that there is a correlation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd Kenney, who was critical of the law, predicted: &quot;After all the publicity the current case is getting you would expect it to go up much more.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tDavid LaBahn, president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys based in Washington, said the increase in reported justifiable homicides could be the result of any number of factors -- including overall crime or population growth.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSmith said that since &quot;stand your ground&quot; passed in 2005, deaths due to self-defense have jumped over 250 percent. When we calculated the average for five years before the law passed and five years after it passed, we found an increase of 200 percent. That&rsquo;s short of Smith&rsquo;s claim, though the numbers largerly support the idea that self-defense deaths have increased since 2005. As for whether &quot;stand your ground&quot; is the reason self-defense deaths are up, experts either disagree or say it&rsquo;s difficult to determine without examining the specifics of each case.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate this statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-03-26T12:11:50.444360", "ruling_date": "2012-03-26T16:02:33", "ruling_headline": "Self-defense deaths in Florida have increased dramatically since 'stand your ground' became law in 2005, lawmaker claims", "ruling_headline_slug": "sen-chris-smith-claimed-deaths-due-self-defense-fl", "ruling_link_text": "Justifiable homicides tripled but the reasons require more analysis", "ruling_state": "Florida", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tFlorida Department of Law Enforcement, Justifiable homicides <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/327501-justifiable-homicides-2000-2010-4.html\">2000-2010</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/327504-justifiable-homicides-2.html\">First half of 2011</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida Department of Enforcement, <a href=\"http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/Content/getdoc/7fad02e4-96bd-46d9-82fc-4a5c46f0be22/datahistory_ucrmanual-1-.aspx\">Uniform Crime Reports Guide Manual</a>, Revised June 2008<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFBI, <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/additional-ucr-publications/ucr_handbook.pdf\">Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook</a>, Revised 2004<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida Senate, <a href=\"http://archive.flsenate.gov/cgi-bin/view_page.pl?Tab=session&amp;Submenu=1&amp;FT=D&amp;File=session/2005/Senate/bills/votes/html/hSB04360405050086.html\">Vote on Senate Bill 436,</a> April 5, 2005<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Sun-Sentinel </em>Broward Politics blog, <a href=\"http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/broward/blog/2012/03/sen_chris_smith_wants_to_revam.html\">&quot;Sen.
