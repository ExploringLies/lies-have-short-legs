Kathleen Peters taking swipes at each other in mailings and TV commercials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/997229-peters1.html#pages\">In the first flier we saw attacking Peters</a>, David Jolly&rsquo;s campaign paints the state representative from South Pasadena as being compliant with the Affordable Care Act. It shows Peters and Democratic challenger Alex Sink in a photo collage with President Barack Obama, with the words, &quot;It&rsquo;s Pinellas County&rsquo;s worst nightmare! &hellip; Keeping Obamacare!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mailing quotes Peters saying, &quot;I do not think we should take a stand and say absolutely repeal it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Republican primary, the attack that a politician is pro-Obamacare -- or even just Obamacare-tolerant -- can be potent. We wanted to know if the flier is accurate in saying that Peters &quot;<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/997228-peters2.html#pages\">refuses to &lsquo;take a stand&rsquo; to repeal Obamacare</a>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The magic word</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peters has been a state representative<strong> </strong>since 2012<strong> </strong>for House District 69, which includes Treasure Island, South Pasadena and Gulfport. We couldn&rsquo;t find any public comments from Peters on the Affordable Care Act before she decided to run for the late C.W. Bill Young&rsquo;s open U.S. House seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a Suncoast Tiger Bay Club forum in St. Petersburg on Dec. 6, &nbsp;Peters fielded a question from an audience member who asked what her position to improve health care was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What I can tell you is that I don&rsquo;t like the plan that we currently have to take care of affordable health care. And I don&rsquo;t even think they named it appropriately, and I think it&rsquo;s one of those wolves in sheep&rsquo;s clothing when they call it the Affordable Care Act, because it is not at all affordable,&quot; Peters answered. &quot;I do not think that we should take a stand and say absolutely repeal it. Not unless we have a plan and a proposal to replace it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She added she didn&rsquo;t think pre-existing conditions should be a factor in obtaining insurance, and gave an anecdote about how she had previously had difficulties with insurance companies after a surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Is it a problem? Yes, we have to address it,&quot; she concluded. &quot;But we can&rsquo;t just repeal it, we have to have a comprehensive plan ... something that&rsquo;s affordable, that isn&rsquo;t mandating down and forces people to not have choices.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jolly, who has been very vocal in his opposition to the law, has said he is using the flier as &quot;a contrast piece,&quot; to illustrate how he wants to repeal the law and Peters doesn&rsquo;t. The quote he chose, however, doesn&rsquo;t include much context or any indication of Peters&rsquo; other talking points about Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peters previously told the <em>Tampa Bay Times</em> she didn&rsquo;t believe &quot;this affordable care act is truly affordable,&quot; but didn&rsquo;t change her message that some portions of the law -- such as not denying coverage to patients -- were worth keeping. &quot;I don&#39;t think we can just go back to the way it was,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This point of view seems to largely fall in line with many Americans. A Gallup poll released on Dec. 6 found that only 30 percent of respondents wanted it gone entirely. The rest wanted to law kept, scaled back or expanded. We should note, though, that<strong> </strong>when the results are broken down by party affiliation, 68 percent of Republicans favor repeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peters seemed to change the tack of her arguments immediately after the flier was mailed out, posting a message on Facebook dealing with Jolly&rsquo;s implications. She began clearly stating she supported repeal of Obamacare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;David Jolly is shamelessly attempting to tie Alex Sink&rsquo;s support of this law with my position,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but at the same time, we have to have a viable option to replace the law.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has since solidified her position, saying during a Dec. 19 press conference that she supports the repeal of Obamacare. &quot;I want to be very clear, I support full repeal of Obamacare,&quot; she said. &quot;Jolly has misrepresented me on this issue.&quot; She also told PolitiFact Florida via email she is seeking to replace the law &quot;with free-market based solutions&quot; and added &quot;there are several Republican alternatives that I am currently reviewing to cosponsor in the future.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her view seems to square with national Republicans who have advocated a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.gop.gov/indepth/pledge/healthcare\"><u>repeal and replace</u></a>&quot; strategy since 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jolly wanted to portray Peters as soft on Obamacare, in an attempt to win over conservative voters. His use of Peters&rsquo; quote, &quot;I do not think we should take a stand and say absolutely repeal it&quot; without context is designed to appeal to voters who want the law taken off the books entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peters<strong> </strong>has repeatedly said she doesn&rsquo;t support the law, but doesn&rsquo;t feel it would be good policy to simply strip the Affordable Care Act off the books without addressing some of the problems in the health care system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her stance lacked specifics before the mailing came out, but it was always clear she wasn&rsquo;t a staunch Obamacare advocate. She repeatedly said or implied the law should go, so long as some provisions could be retained, such as helping people with pre-existing conditions get insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mailer<strong> </strong>attempts to make it appear as if she supports the law, which she didn&rsquo;t do even before clarifying her message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-12-23T13:27:03.202773", "ruling_date": "2013-12-27T10:05:29", "ruling_headline": "David Jolly says Kathleen Peters won\u2019t 'take a stand' to repeal Obamacare", "ruling_headline_slug": "david-jolly-says-kathleen-peters-wont-take-stand-r", "ruling_link_text": "More replace, but still repeal", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Campaign mailer, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/997229-peters1.html#pages\">It&rsquo;s Pinellas County&rsquo;s Worst Nightmare!
