And later: &quot;In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don&#39;t need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama refuted Romney&rsquo;s remark, saying, &quot;Let me just point out first of all this board that we&#39;re talking about can&#39;t make decisions about what treatments are given.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor this fact-check, we will focus on Romney&rsquo;s statement about whether the unelected board -- formally called the Independent Payments Advisory board, or IPAB for short -- can tell people what kind of treatments they can have.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe&rsquo;ve previously checked a whole slew of<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/tennessee/article/2012/apr/02/rhetoric-rises-debate-over-payment-advisory-board/\"> claims</a> about the health care law and the IPAB. Many of the variations of Romney&rsquo;s claim have been in false territory -- depending on the wording -- including a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/mar/19/pat-boone/pat-boone-says-health-care-advisory-board-can-rati/\">Pants on Fire</a> for Pat Boone who said the board &quot;can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments.&quot; (That was one of our <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2012/jun/27/top-5-falsehoods-about-health-care-law/\">Top 5 falsehoods</a> on the health care law.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe gave a<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/aug/23/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-said-15-unelected-unaccountable-bureaucr/\"> Mostly False</a> to Paul Ryan who said that the &quot;unelected, unaccountable&quot; board created by the health care law &quot;will lead to denied care for current seniors.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe will note up front that Romney used somewhat softer words than some other critics of the board in that he didn&rsquo;t use the words &quot;ration&quot; or &quot;unaccountable.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>IPAB can&rsquo;t ration care or make decisions for individuals</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe will borrow from our previous items to explain the board and Romney&rsquo;s claim. Some of our information comes from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that studies health care, which put out a<a href=\"http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/7961-02.pdf\"> primer</a> in 2010 about the board and a longer<a href=\"http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/8150.pdf\"> paper</a> in 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe health care law directs a new national board &mdash; with 15 members who are political appointees &mdash; to identify Medicare savings. It&#39;s forbidden from submitting &quot;any recommendation to ration health care,&quot; as Section 3403 of the health care law states. It may not raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The IPAB also cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhat it can do is reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of re-admissions or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some argue that because the IPAB can reduce the money a doctor receives, this could lead to an indirect form of rationing.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut the board wouldn&#39;t make any health care decisions for individual Americans. Instead,<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/12/michele-bachmann/ipab-board-15-bureaucrats-who-will-decide-nation-s/\"> as PolitiFact Georgia reported, </a>it would make broad policy decisions that affect Medicare&#39;s overall cost.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor this fact-check, a Romney campaign spokesman sent us a 2011 <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/54952.html\">POLITICO</a> article that largely focused on the challenges of filling the spots on the board, which the headline described as &quot;Medicare cost-cutting job could be worst in D.C.&quot; The article mentioned that Republicans have portrayed it as rationing care, but that the law prohibits the board from rationing health care.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Romney campaign also cited the <em><a href=\"http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/industry-targets-medicare-board/\">New York Times</a></em> health care blog Prescriptions, which stated in 2010 that the drug industry, hospitals and doctors&rsquo; groups want to get rid of the board.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;While the board is not supposed to be able to cut benefits, industry groups fear that its actions would result in rationing care,&quot; stated the <em>New York Times </em>blog. &quot;The board, known as IPAB, could cut payments to health care providers.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen Romney was talking about the Independent Payment Advisory Board and Medicare, he said, Barack Obama &quot;put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they&#39;re going to receive.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe avoided the more inaccurate and harsher wording of some other critics, who have falsely described the board as &quot;rationing&quot; care. But Romney&rsquo;s claim can leave viewers with the impression that the board will sit around a table and talk about whether grandpa can get his bypass or not, and that&rsquo;s not the case.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe board can reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of re-admissions or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. And there are questions about whether that could lead to different treatment decisions, but Romney&#39;s comments give a misleading impression. We rate his statement Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-10-03T23:37:05.119544", "ruling_date": "2012-10-04T00:12:24", "ruling_headline": "Romney says IPAB board can \"tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.\u201d", "ruling_headline_slug": "romney-says-ipab-board-can-tell-people-ultimately-", "ruling_link_text": "The board doesn't make individual treatment decisions", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tPolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/mar/19/pat-boone/pat-boone-says-health-care-advisory-board-can-rati/\">&quot;Pat Boone says health care advisory board can ration care and deny Medicare treatments,&quot;
