How about Lynch? Here it gets a little complicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lynch&rsquo;s nomination was initially received in the Senate on Nov. 13, 2014. The Senate -- then under lame-duck Democratic control -- did not move the nomination forward. One obvious problem, beyond a short calendar interrupted by Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks: Rushing the nomination through might have been seen as thwarting the will of the people, who had just voted for a Republican Senate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, the Obama administration resubmitted Lynch&rsquo;s nomination to the newly Republican-held chamber on Jan. 7, 2015. That&rsquo;s standard procedure when one Congress ends and another begins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you count the entire period -- from Nov. 13 to April 17, the day of Obama&rsquo;s remark -- then Lynch had waited for 155 days (and 158 by this article&rsquo;s publication date). That&rsquo;s easily more than the 119 logged by the previous seven nominees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if you count only the time after the Republicans took over the Senate -- the period for which Obama&rsquo;s obstructionism argument is strongest -- the delay was 100 days by the time of Obama&rsquo;s comments, and 103 by this article&rsquo;s publication. That&rsquo;s less than the 119 days waited by the previous seven nominees, though it&rsquo;s possible the wait could ultimately reach or exceed 119 days if no action is taken by early May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama does has a point that the delay for Lynch -- however many days it was -- has been unusually long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the hundreds and hundreds of nominations submitted in recent decades, only a few have waited for longer than 100 days, according to the Senate Historical Office. Among the more notable waits:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Richard Cordray, nominated for director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2011-13: <strong>1+ years</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Miguel Estrada, nominated for U.S. Circuit Court judgeship, 2003: <strong>240 days</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Richard Holbrooke, ambassador to the United Nations, 1999: <strong>176 days </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Lewis L. Strauss, nominated for Commerce Secretary, 1959: <strong>152 days</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Robert Gates, nominated for CIA Director, 1991: <strong>134 days</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Robert Bork, nominated for Supreme Court, 1987: <strong>108 days</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of these, the only nominee for an official Cabinet position to wait longer than Lynch was Strauss, and that was more than half a century ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Lynch&rsquo;s case is pretty unusual by historical standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a political scientist at George Washington University, sees the argument for starting the clock with the resubmission of Lynch&rsquo;s nomination, but she added that focusing on that distinction misses the larger point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Presidents are typically given the right to field their own team,&quot; Binder said. &quot;Given Lynch&#39;s previous confirmations and stellar credentials, why force her and the president to wait so long for a confirmation vote?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist who has studied the Senate, agreed. &quot;There&rsquo;s a little sleight of hand&quot; in Obama&rsquo;s comment, &quot;but the overall message is that there&rsquo;s been a lot of delay and that it&rsquo;s historic in length.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it&rsquo;s not as if Republicans were powerless to resist even if the Democratic-controlled Senate had tried to act, said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist and Senate expert at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Democrats could have moved the nomination quickly at the end of the last Congress if the Republicans were not requiring cloture on everything, even nominations, which created a backlog of must-pass legislation and nominations as the Congress came to a close,&quot; Smith said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obama said that Lynch&rsquo;s nomination &quot;has been now sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mathematically, Obama was correct if you start counting from Lynch&rsquo;s initial nomination, but short by 19 days if you start counting from the resubmission of her nomination to the newly installed Republican-controlled Senate. Either way, it&rsquo;s clear that Obama has a point that Lynch&rsquo;s delay has been long by historical standards, especially for a Cabinet nominee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-04-20T15:11:01.614319", "ruling_date": "2015-04-20T15:49:30", "ruling_headline": "Is Loretta Lynch nomination delayed longer than 7 other attorneys general combined?", "ruling_headline_slug": "loretta-lynch-nomination-delayed-attorney-generals", "ruling_link_text": "Almost unprecedented historically", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Barack Obama, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/04/17/remarks-president-obama-and-prime-minister-renzi-italy-joint-press-confe\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>remarks at joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi</u></a>, April 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>U.S. Senate, &quot;Nominations &amp; Treaties&quot; <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/two_column_table/Nominations_and_Treaties.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>data page</u></a>, accessed April 20, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CNN, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/17/politics/obama-loretta-lynch-embarrassing/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Obama rips Senate over Lynch nomination: &#39;This is embarrassing,&#39; </u></a>&quot; April 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fivethirtyeight.com, &quot;<a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/loretta-lynchs-prolonged-confirmation-wait-is-unusual-but-not-unprecedented/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Loretta Lynch&rsquo;s Prolonged Confirmation Wait Is Unusual, But Not Unprecedented</u></a>,&quot; March 19, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Donald Ritchie, historian of the U.S. Senate, April 20, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Burdett Loomis, University of Kansas political scientist, April 20, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Sarah Binder, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and political scientist at George Washington University, April 20, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Steven S.
