James Langevin, a Democrat, and Rhue Reis, the Republican who would like to replace him. The two were talking about what to do about the children coming across the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reis said they should be sent back to their respective countries because the United States has too many problems of its own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It needs to stop for their safety and because we cannot handle the influx. We have a much more difficult time taking care of our own,&quot; he said. &quot;When you have 200,000 to 400,000 military veterans on the street in this country on any given day, we can&#39;t take care of them and yet we want to bring in another influx of tens or hundreds of thousands of people, illegal immigrants? We can&#39;t even take care of our own.&quot; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wondered &nbsp;whether Reis was correct about the number of homeless veterans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked him for his source, Reis referred us to a web page from the <a href=\"http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/veterans.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>National Coalition for the Homeless</u></a>, which featured a &nbsp;fact sheet written in 2009. It pegs the count at 130,000 to 200,000 per night -- substantially less than Reis&rsquo;s 200,000 to 400,000 number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.As we searched for more information, we found several different and equally dated estimates from other advocacy groups for veterans and the homeless, some lower, some higher</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, <a href=\"http://homeless.samhsa.gov/ResourceFiles/file_Vital_Mission_Final.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>in 2007</u></a>, the <a href=\"http://www.endhomelessness.org/pages/veterans\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>National Alliance to End Homelessness</u></a> and the Homelessness &nbsp;Research Institute used data from the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to estimate the numbers at 192,000 in 2004, 194,254 in 2005 and 195,827 in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that same group now says the nightly number of veterans who are homeless is just under 50,000. That&rsquo;s far lower than Reis&rsquo; number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why the dramatic drop?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out that the newest numbers come from the U.s. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since January 2009, they&#39;ve conducted an annual &quot;Point-in-Time Count&quot; of the homeless who spend the night in shelters or are on the street. It&#39;s done by groups that regularly work with the homeless and who have become very good at tracking them down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The bottom line is, until 2009 we didn&#39;t have accurate counts for veteran homelessness,&quot; said Emanuel Cavallaro, spokesman for the National Alliance. Before direct counting was done, and the people doing the counting became adept at identifying whether a homeless person was a veteran, the estimate was done by the VA. &quot;That [VA] data was very problematic and wasn&#39;t very reliable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So while the VA was estimating 131,000 homeless veterans per night in 2009, the &nbsp;&nbsp;point-in-time &nbsp;census of the homeless put the number at 75,609. It rose to 76,329 the following year in the midst of the Great Recession and <a href=\"https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/AHAR-2013-Part1.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>has been declining ever since</u></a>, according to the point-in-time counts. <a href=\"http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2014/HUDNo_14-103\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>The count for January 2014</u></a>: 49,933.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number has been declining, said HUD spokesman Patrick Rodenbush, because there has been a concerted effort in recent years by the Obama administration and Congress to get housing for homeless veterans. &quot;In an era of budget cuts, this is one area where Congress has been fully funding the president&#39;s requests,&quot; he said. &quot;This gets bipartisan support.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rhue Reis said, &quot;You have 200,000 to 400,000 military veterans on the street in this country on any given day.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reis inaccurately cited a 2009 study, which said the number at that time wasn&rsquo;t more than 200,000. The latest, best data suggests that the current number is closer to 50,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Homelessness among veterans is a serious problem, but the numbers are much lower than Reiss claimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>his statement False</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>PolitiFact Rhode Island</u></a> to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
