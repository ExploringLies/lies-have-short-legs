She released her &quot;<a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/08/10/college-compact-costs/\">New College Compact</a>&quot; plan in August 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The closest thing the Trump campaign has to a &quot;higher education plan&quot; was revealed in a Inside Higher Ed <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/05/13/trumps-campaign-co-chair-describes-higher-education-policies-being-developed\">interview</a> with Trump&rsquo;s national co-chairman and policy director, Sam Clovis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clovis said a Trump administration would focus on overhauling the student loan system by transitioning the responsibility for lending from the government to private banks, and floated the idea of basing loan eligibility on<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/05/13/trumps-campaign-co-chair-describes-higher-education-policies-being-developed\"> which majors</a> college students pick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you are going to study 16th century French art, more power to you.

Elizabeth Warren</a>. D-Mass., have panned the change as generating profit on the backs of over-burdened college students, but it&rsquo;s not clear that a shift to the old system or Trump&rsquo;s proposal would make college cheaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevada Democratic Party chair Roberta Lange says Donald Trump &quot;literally has no plans to make higher education more affordable.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump hasn&rsquo;t released any sort of traditional higher education reform plan &mdash; much less any details on how to make college more affordable &mdash; unlike&nbsp;Clinton, Romney and McCain.
