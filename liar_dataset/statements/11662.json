ISIS claimed credit last May when two terrorist gunmen launched an attack in Garland, Texas. Less than two weeks later, the FBI arrested an Iraqi-born man in North Texas and charged him with lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The letter went on to say that &quot;in 2014, when I served as Texas attorney general, we participated in a Joint Terrorism Task Force that arrested two Austin residents for providing material support to terrorists -- including ISIS.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To determine if Abbott got his facts straight, we looked at each of the incidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An Austin-area arrest and conviction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of this was old ground for us.

He told them he was planning to visit family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interviewed a second time five days later, Abood said his intent was to join the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in the struggle against Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria. Later in April 2013,<strong> </strong>Abood travelled to Turkey via Mexico, &quot;on or about&quot; April 29.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agents again interviewed Abood upon his return to the United States on Sept. 16, 2013. He admitted he had travelled to Syria and stayed in an FSA camp, but denied financially supporting any terrorist group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A search of Abood&rsquo;s computer in July 2014 found that he had tweeted a pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, on June 19, 2014. He later denied pledging allegiance to ISIS and was arrested for making &quot;a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement and representation, in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbott&rsquo;s letter mischaracterizes the nature of Abood&rsquo;s offense; he wrote that Abood was charged with &quot;lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS,&quot; not lying about a tweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shootings in Garland</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third incident referenced by Abbott was the Garland, Texas, shooting scheme attempted by Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi on May 5, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/file/769556/download\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a criminal complaint</u></a> the FBI later filed against a Florida man who claimed to have encouraged the attack, the two planned to shoot attendees at a contest centered around cartoons of the prophet Muhammad (drawing the prophet Muhammad is forbidden in Islam).
