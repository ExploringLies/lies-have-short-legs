Clinton bashed Sanders for opposing a 2007 immigration bill. He fired back that she opposed driver&rsquo;s licenses for illegal immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, who wanted to do right thing and provide driver&#39;s licenses to those who are undocumented,&quot; Sanders said during the debate at Miami Dade College on March 9. &quot;She said &lsquo;don&rsquo;t do it&rsquo;, and New York state still does not do it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did Clinton -- who has sought the Latino vote in Florida and elsewhere -- prevail upon Spitzer to not allow driver&rsquo;s licenses for illegal immigrants in New York?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clinton on driver&rsquo;s licenses in 2008 race</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2007, Spitzer proposed giving driver&rsquo;s licenses to illegal immigrants. Supporters said it would allow those who simply wanted to get to work to get &quot;out of the shadows,&quot; and get insurance while opponents saw it as a privilege for those who broke the law by illegally coming to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I know exactly what Gov. Spitzer&#39;s trying to do, and it makes a lot of sense, because he&#39;s trying to get people out of the shadows,&quot; Clinton told the editorial board of the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/hillary-cheers-doesn-back-spitzer-license-plan-article-1.227362\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Nashua Telegraph</u></a><em> </em>in October 2007, according to an article in the <em>New York Daily News </em>at the time. &quot;He&#39;s trying to say, &#39;Okay, come forward, and we will give you this license.&#39; &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During an Oct. 30, 2007, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/us/politics/30debate-transcript.html?pagewanted=37&amp;_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>debate</u></a>, co-moderator Tim Russert asked her about her comments and Spitzer&rsquo;s plan. She gave a muddled answer in which she made a case for it and against it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You know, Tim, this is where everybody plays gotcha. It makes a lot of sense. What is the governor supposed to do? He is dealing with a serious problem. We have failed, and George Bush has failed. Do I think this is the best thing for any governor to do? No. But do I understand the sense of real desperation, trying to get a handle on this? Remember, in New York we want to know who&#39;s in New York. We want people to come out of the shadows. He&#39;s making an honest effort to do it. We should have passed immigration reform.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About two weeks later, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/nyregion/14cnd-spitzer.html?hp&amp;mtrref=thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com&amp;gwh=8D1FE0EF6FEF888C4F45B055FEB80888&amp;gwt=pay\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Spitzer dropped his plan</u></a>, saying it faced opposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the March 2016 debate, Sanders&rsquo; campaign sent a November 2007 <em>New York Times</em> story about a <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/clinton-now-against-licenses-for-illegal-immigrants/?_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>statement</u></a> Clinton made saying she supported his decision to drop the plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As president, I will not support drivers&#39; licenses for undocumented people and will press for comprehensive immigration reform that deals with all of the issues around illegal immigration including border security and fixing our broken system.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spitzer, who resigned in 2009 amid a prostitution scandal, talked about Clinton&rsquo;s past statements on driver&rsquo;s licenses in an interview he gave to David Axelrod in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;When Mr. Axelrod asked if the Clinton campaign had asked Mr. Spitzer to scrap the plan, he replied, &lsquo;Yeah, we heard from folks who said they want this issue gone,&rsquo; &quot; the <em>New York Times </em>reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clinton on driver&rsquo;s licenses in 2016 race</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But during the 2016 presidential campaign, Clinton changed her position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 2015, a Clinton spokeswoman told the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/16/clinton-drivers-licenses-undocumented_n_7072570.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Huffington Post</u></a>: &quot;Hillary supports state policies to provide driver&#39;s licenses to undocumented immigrants.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton herself addressed it during a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-na-0219-democrats-town-hall-nevada-20160219-story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>town hall</u></a> in February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Back then, it was a state-by-state determination, and I&#39;m happy that most states have understood and moved in the right direction,&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact contacted spokespersons for Clinton&rsquo;s campaign during the debate and asked if she had any evidence to refute Sanders&rsquo; claim and did not get a reply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a conference call with reporters the day before the debate, Clinton surrogates didn&rsquo;t answer questions about why she changed her position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Today our goal has moved well beyond driver&#39;s&rsquo; licenses,&quot; U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois said. &quot;We are talking about citizenship. As president she will fight for that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanders said that &quot;Secretary Clinton prevailed upon the governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, who wanted to do right thing and provide driver&#39;s licenses to those who are undocumented. She said don&rsquo;t do it, and New York state still does not do it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clinton waffled on driver&rsquo;s licenses for illegal immigrants in a debate in October 2007. When Spitzer dropped his proposal, she came out with a statement supporting his decision to ax the plan to give the driver&rsquo;s licenses. Sanders omitted that this occurred during her first presidential race and that during this campaign she has supported driver&rsquo;s licenses for illegal immigrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7431e579-4985-452f-bc68-ac2aa05ca56d\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7431e579-4985-452f-bc68-ac2aa05ca56d</a>", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-03-09T22:38:50.787262", "ruling_date": "2016-03-09T22:38:15", "ruling_headline": "Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton opposed driver's licenses for illegal immigrants ", "ruling_headline_slug": "bernie-sanders-says-hillary-clinton-opposed-driver", "ruling_link_text": "She waffled in 2007", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Univision/Washington Post, Democratic debate, March 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Daily News</em>, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/hillary-cheers-doesn-back-spitzer-license-plan-article-1.227362\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Hillary cheers, but doesn&#39;t back Spitzer license plan,&quot;</u></a> Oct. 19, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/us/politics/30debate-transcript.html?pagewanted=37&amp;_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;The Democratic debate on MSNBC,&quot;</u></a> Oct. 30, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/clinton-now-against-licenses-for-illegal-immigrants/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Clinton Now Against Licenses for Illegal Immigrants,&quot;</u></a> Nov. 14, 2007</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huffington Post, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/16/clinton-drivers-licenses-undocumented_n_7072570.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Hillary Clinton Takes Firm Stance On Driver&#39;s Licenses For The Undocumented After Slip-Up In 2008 Race,&quot;</u></a> April 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/04/16/this-time-hillary-clinton-supports-giving-drivers-licenses-to-undocumented-immigrants/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;This time, Hillary Clinton supports giving driver&rsquo;s licenses to undocumented immigrants,&quot;</u></a> April 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/29/eliot-spitzer-sharply-criticizes-hillary-clinton-on-2007-immigration-stance/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Eliot Spitzer sharply criticizes Hillary Clinton on 2007 immigration stance,&quot;</u></a> Oct. 29, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Miami Herald</em>, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article65056107.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>&quot;Campaigns for Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders spar on immigration before Miami debate,&quot; </u></a>March 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bernie Sanders campaign, Press release, March 9, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "barely_true_count": 20, "current_job": "U.S. Senator", "false_count": 15, "first_name": "Bernie", "half_true_count": 28, "home_state": "Vermont", "id": 218, "last_name": "Sanders", "mostly_true_count": 46, "name_slug": "bernie-sanders", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 6, "party": "Independent", "party_slug": "independent", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/6/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "", "advalue": "", "edition": "Vermont", "edition_slug": "vermont", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 65, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "Vermont Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/65/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/218/", "total_count": 129, "true_count": 16, "website": "http://sanders.senate.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>When New York Gov.
