Richard Burr, R-N.C., now in charge of Senate oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency, it&rsquo;s unclear how much the CIA&rsquo;s torture legacy will remain in the spotlight. But leave it to <em>Doonesbury</em> to pipe up with a reminder that enhanced interrogation came with an enhanced price tag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"http://doonesbury.washingtonpost.com/strip/archive/2015/1/11\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Sunday&rsquo;s Jan. 11 strip</u></a>, the debauched character Duke, now a K Street lobbyist, looks up from his newspaper in surprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It turns out that before 9/11, the CIA didn&rsquo;t have any real torture experience,&quot; Duke says. &quot;So they hired these two psychologists, Dr. Jessen and Dr. Mitchell, to develop and run their torture program. For which they were paid $81 million!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reader asked us if that was accurate, and we can report that in large part, it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked for his source, Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau told PunditFact &quot;this one is an easy Google,&quot; and sent us a Wikipedia link.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked at the <a href=\"http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/study2014/sscistudy1.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>report</u></a> from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and found the key details on page 18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The CIA contracted with two psychologists to develop, operate, and assess its interrogation operations,&quot; the report said. &quot;In 2005, the psychologists formed a company specifically for the purpose of conducting their work with the CIA. Shortly thereafter, the CIA outsourced virtually all aspects of the program. In 2006, the value of the CIA&#39;s base contract with the company formed by the psychologists with all options exercised was in excess of $180 million; the contractors received $81 million prior to the contract&#39;s termination in 2009. In 2007, the CIA provided a multi-year indemnification agreement to protect the company and its employees from legal liability arising out of the program. The CIA has since paid out more than $1 million pursuant to the agreement.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Senate report did not name the two psychologists, but many news reports did. The<em> <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/afghanistan-pakistan/la-fg-torture-psychologists-20141214-story.html#page=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Los Angeles Times</u></a></em> reached James Mitchell at his home in Land O&rsquo; Lakes, Fla. The paper reported that Mitchell rejected the committee&rsquo;s description of his work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Go ahead and smear me if you want,&quot; Mitchell told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. &lsquo;A lot of what&#39;s written in the Senate &hellip; report is just flat-out wrong. It&#39;s taken out of context.&quot; (We&#39;re attempting to reach Mitchell; if we hear from him, we&#39;ll let you know.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The<em> Los Angeles</em><em> </em><em>Times</em> described how&nbsp;Mitchell&rsquo;s colleague<strong> </strong>Bruce Jessen was on hand in 2002 when an Afghan detainee was stripped and dragged down a hallway. The detainee was later found dead in an unheated cell and an autopsy concluded that he likely froze to death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some details the cartoon doesn&#39;t go into that are worth noting. First,&nbsp;Mitchell and Jessen&rsquo;s company had a total of seven owners. So presumably the two men weren&#39;t the only people receiving money. Second, the $81 million isn&#39;t pure profit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the&nbsp;<em>Los Angeles Times,</em>&nbsp;the money covered a range of expenses. Mitchell and Jessen&#39;s company &quot;provided interrogators, operation psychologists, debriefers and security guards&quot; to CIA secret prisons. The final payments included&nbsp;$75 million for services and&nbsp;$5 million in case the company&nbsp;faced criminal prosecution or other legal liability, the&nbsp;<em>Los Angeles Times</em> said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Doonesbury</em>, aka Garry Trudeau, said that the CIA paid two psychologists $81 million to develop and run its torture program. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report confirms the amount of money spent on a variety of things. Other news organizations revealed the actual names of the two men -- though in reality seven people owned the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The claim is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly&nbsp;True.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1448393631/live-fact-checking-2015-state-of-the-union-and-gop\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Help fund PolitiFact&rsquo;s Kickstarter to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union and GOP response.</u></a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-01-12T12:53:41.163604", "ruling_date": "2015-01-12T13:53:32", "ruling_headline": "Doonesbury: CIA paid $81 million for torture program", "ruling_headline_slug": "doonesbury-cia-paid-81-million-torture-program", "ruling_link_text": "Torture, Inc.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"http://doonesbury.washingtonpost.com/strip/archive/2015/1/11\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Doonesbury</u></a>, Jan. 11, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, <a href=\"http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/study2014/sscistudy1.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Committee study of the Central Intelligence Agency&rsquo;s detention and interrogation program</u></a>, Dec. 3, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NBC News, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/cia-torture-report/cia-paid-torture-teachers-more-80-million-n264756\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>CIA Paid Torture Teachers More Than $80 Million</u></a>, Dec. 14, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Los Angeles Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/afghanistan-pakistan/la-fg-torture-psychologists-20141214-story.html#page=1\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Two psychologists&#39; role in CIA torture program comes into focus</u></a>, Dec. 14, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saturday Night Live, <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/12/14/snl-charlie-rose-torture/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Torture interview</u></a>, Dec. 13, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview, Garry Trudeau, Jan. 12, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "", "id": 1017, "last_name": "Doonesbury", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "doonesbury", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Doonesbury.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Punditfact", "edition": "PunditFact", "edition_slug": "punditfact", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 48, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The PunditFact Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/48/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1017/", "total_count": 6, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.doonesbury.com/strip"}, "statement": "<p>The CIA paid two psychologists $81 million &quot;to develop and run their torture program.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "the Sunday comics", "statement_date": "2015-01-11", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 113, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/113/", "subject": "Afghanistan", "subject_slug": "afghanistan", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 105, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/105/", "subject": "Human Rights", "subject_slug": "human-rights", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 1, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/1/", "subject": "Iraq", "subject_slug": "iraq", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 37, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/37/", "subject": "Terrorism", "subject_slug": "terrorism", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
