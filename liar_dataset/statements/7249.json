But U.S. Rep. Tom Price, a Roswell Republican, begged to differ.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;My assessment was that it ultimately raised taxes and didn&rsquo;t decrease any spending. In fact, it increased spending,&quot; Price said during a Jan. 2 interview on WMAL-FM, a Washington-area radio station. He voted against the deal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo which one is it? A spending increase or cut?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA prior PolitiFact check addressed Price&rsquo;s claim on taxes and found it was Half True. It&rsquo;s valid to see the deal as a tax cut or an increase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThanks to the deal, our taxes are lower than if Congress allowed the nation to fall off the fiscal cliff and stay there. But we&rsquo;re paying more taxes than we did in 2012. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, we wondered, is the deal&rsquo;s impact on spending a matter of perspective as well?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFor the most part, yes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCompared with what would have happened without a deal, it&rsquo;s a spending increase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs we mentioned before, the old statute required automatic spending cuts on Jan. 1. If this law stayed in place, outlays would have totaled nearly $47. 4 trillion over 10 years, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which measures the impact of legislation on the budget.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPassage of the deal pushed the CBO&rsquo;s estimate to more than $47.7 trillion, a spending boost of about $330 billion. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut compared with what the federal government spent in 2012, the deal is a cut, CBO figures show.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe agency calculated spending changes based on an &quot;alternative fiscal scenario&quot; in which 2013 outlays would have stayed roughly the same as they were in 2012.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing this baseline, spending would have topped $50 trillion through 2022. Spending under the deal is about $2.3 trillion lower.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow here&rsquo;s where things get complicated. Even when analysts use the same baseline, estimates on the deal&rsquo;s spending impact can vary by tens of billions of dollars.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tConsider estimates by the conservative Heritage Foundation and the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThey compared spending under the fiscal cliff deal with the former law.<br />\r\n\tAs we said above, the fiscal cliff deal is a spending increase if you use this baseline. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Heritage Foundation found that the deal increased spending by $47 billion over 10 years. This is proof that Congress has not gotten serious about cutting the budget, said Patrick Louis Knudsen, a senior fellow in federal budgetary affairs at the think tank.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;As dollar amounts go, it&rsquo;s not a very large amount,&quot; Knudsen said. &quot;But as a matter of principle it is.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn the other hand, the CBPP estimates that the increase is closer to $3 billion over 10 years. The group concluded it was not a significant increase.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnalyses differ because they tally certain spending line items differently. But in the world of trillion-dollar federal budgets, this $44 billion gap is not a major one. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;With so much money being spent, whether spending goes up by $3 billion or $47 billion is a rounding error,&quot; said Howard Gleckman, an Urban Institute budget expert. &quot;We will never know who is right. I just say the deal barely changed spending from CBO&#39;s projections.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOne last thing. As we mentioned in our prior fact check on the tax portion of Price&rsquo;s claim, the trick is to make sure you don&rsquo;t mix up your baselines.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf your analysis compares current spending with expenditures in 2012, use the same baseline for taxes as well, experts told us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrice runs into trouble on this front. His conclusion that taxes rose is valid compared with the amount paid in 2012. But from this perspective, spending is actually down.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOnce again, we come to the conclusion that Price is both right and wrong.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf Congress had failed to change the law in 2012 that sent the country off the fiscal cliff, federal spending would be lower than it is now.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut if spending had stayed at 2012 levels, it would be higher. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPrice&rsquo;s claim on spending is technically accurate. But he leaves out critical &nbsp;information. And he mixes his budget baselines to make a point. In our book, that&rsquo;s a Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-01-14T17:24:33.012808", "ruling_date": "2013-01-15T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Claim spending rose under fiscal cliff deal misses half the story", "ruling_headline_slug": "claim-spending-rose-under-fiscal-cliff-deal-misses", "ruling_link_text": "Price isn't quite right", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Political Insider blog, &quot;<a href=\"http://blogs.ajc.com/political-insider-jim-galloway/2013/01/02/tom-price-the-u-s-house-needs-%E2%80%98red-state%E2%80%99-leadership/\">Tom Price: The U.S. House needs &lsquo;red state&rsquo; leadership</a>,&quot; Jan. 2, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43835\">The &lsquo;Fiscal Cliff&rsquo; Deal</a>,&quot; Jan 4, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Heritage Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://blog.heritage.org/2013/01/08/tax-changes-2013\">Morning Bell: 13 Tax Increases in 2013</a>,&quot; Jan. 8, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/American%20Taxpayer%20Relief%20Act.pdf\">Estimate of the Budgetary Effects of H.R. 8, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012</a>,&quot; Jan. 1, 2013<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/American%20Taxpayer%20Relief%20Act.pdf\"> </a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJoint Committee on Taxation, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=4497\">Estimated Revenue Effects Of The Revenue Provisions Contained In An Amendment In The Nature Of A Substitute To H.R. 8, The &lsquo;American Taxpayer Relief Act Of 2012,&rsquo; As Passed By The Senate On January 1, 2013</a>,&quot; Jan. 1, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Policy Center,<a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/upload/FederalBudget_ATRA.pdf\"> Federal Revenues and Outlays Under Various Scenarios, 2012-2022</a>, Jan. 1, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tU.S. Government Printing Office, American Tax Relief Act of 2012,<a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr8enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr8enr.pdf\"> www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr8enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr8enr.pdf</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Heritage Foundation, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/01/fiscal-cliff-deal-added-47-billion-in-spending\">Fiscal Cliff Deal Added $47 Billion in Spending</a>,&quot; Jan. 10, 2013</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.offthechartsblog.org/the-next-act-further-deficit-reduction-must-include-a-mix-of-revenues-and-spending-cuts/\">The Next Act: Further Deficit Reduction Must Include a Mix of Revenues and Spending Cuts</a>,&quot; &nbsp;Jan. 2, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Joshua Gordon, policy director, Concord Coalition, Jan. 8, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Howard Gleckman, resident fellow, Tax Policy Center, Urban Institute, Jan. 9, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEmail interview, Ryan Murphy, spokesman, U.S. Rep.
