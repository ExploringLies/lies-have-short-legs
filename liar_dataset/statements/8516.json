One of these targeted incumbents is three-term Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A full year before the election,<strong> </strong>one conservative group -- Americans for Prosperity, founded by billionaire libertarian brothers David and Charles Koch -- has already <a href=\"http://americansforprosperity.org/newsroom/afp-continues-holding-politicians-accountable-with-obamacare-ad-effort/\"><u>begun to air</u></a> a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5ZQ8KU49dE\"><u>30-second spot</u></a> critical of<strong> </strong>Landrieu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ad ties Landrieu to President Barack Obama&rsquo;s health care law. As ominous music plays in the background, a narrator highlights Landrieu&rsquo;s past support of the law and an on-screen headline flashes on the screen: &quot;New mandates are already reducing full-time employment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Louisianans told Mary Landrieu to vote &lsquo;no&rsquo; on Obamacare. Instead she sided with Barack Obama,&quot; the narrator says. &quot;Now we&rsquo;re paying the price.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mandate in question is a provision in the Affordable Care Act that requires companies that employ 50 or more full-time workers -- those that work 30 hours a week -- to provide health insurance or else face a penalty. This provision of the law has led some to speculate that large companies will cut back on hours, or on employees, to avoid incurring the added costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But is there evidence that &quot;new mandates are already reducing full-time employment,&quot; as the ad says? We took a look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Economy looms large</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The headline used in the ad came from an editorial in the <em><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324616604578304072420873666\"><u>Wall Street</u><u> </u><u>Journal</u></a></em>, which has been critical of Obama&rsquo;s health care law. The unsigned editorial, published in February,<strong> </strong>is largely based on anecdotal evidence from companies, mostly in the fast food sector, that have said they plan to reduce employee hours in the wake of the mandates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, independent analysis suggests that the recession and the slow recovery are a bigger culprit than Obamacare, at least so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we noted when we checked a recent claim by CNBC&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/22/maria-bartiromo/bartiromo-says-obamacare-turning-us-part-time-empl/\"><u>Maria Bartiromo</u></a>, a report from the<a href=\"http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2013/august/part-time-work-employment-increase-recession/\"> <u>Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco</u></a><u> </u>puts the current situation into context. The recession drove up the fraction of part-time workers from about 17 percent in 2007 to a peak of 19.7 percent in 2010. It has declined since then.<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t09.htm\"> <u>As of the latest data,</u></a> it stands at 19 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study&rsquo;s bottom line is that recessions drive up the fraction of the workforce who are in part-time jobs when they would rather be working full-time. The 1983 recession pushed the share of part-timers to 20.3 percent. That&rsquo;s significantly higher than the peak for the most recent recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s different this time though is that the part-time employment rate has remained higher for many more months than in past recessions. The authors put the cause squarely at the feet of the overall economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The U.S. labor market has recovered only about three-fourths of the jobs lost during the recession and its aftermath, which leaves finding a full-time job still challenging for many workers,&quot; they said. &quot;General labor market slack remains the key factor keeping part-time employment high.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report considers whether the Affordable Care Act could be shaping employers&#39; hiring decisions, but concludes that other factors -- including long-standing IRS rules -- suggest the ACA has not made a significant change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Before the law was passed, most large employers already faced IRS rules that prevented them from denying available health benefits to full-time workers. These rules gave employers an incentive to create part-time jobs to avoid rising health benefit costs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article published by the paper&rsquo;s news side, &nbsp;titled &quot;<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/10/22/dont-blame-health-law-for-high-part-time-employment/?mod=wsj_nview_latest\"><u>Don&rsquo;t Blame Health Law for High Part-Time Unemployment</u></a>,&quot; concurs with this analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted<strong> </strong>Americans For Prosperity, the group pointed us to an <a href=\"http://news.investors.com/politics-obamacare/101713-669013-obamacare-employer-mandate-a-list-of-cuts-to-work-hours-jobs.htm\"><u>article in <em>Investor&rsquo;s Business Daily</em></u></a><em> </em>that catalogs all the companies that are curbing hours to less than 30 a week as a result of Obamacare. But the data is less convincing than it appears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of those employers, many of them in the public sector, are cutting back the hours of workers who already aren&rsquo;t considered full-time -- a development that wouldn&rsquo;t provide full support for the contention that &quot;new mandates are already reducing full-time employment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the 350 employers listed, about 200 said they will be limiting the hours of their part-time work force, and dozens others were cutting hourly workers or positions for student teachers, adjunct professors, or similar jobs that would not have been counted as full-time workers anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its ad, Americans for Prosperity said that new mandates from Obamacare &quot;are already reducing full-time employment.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a plausible scenario, but as of now, it&rsquo;s largely speculative, with the evidence anecdotal rather than statistical.<strong> </strong>Across the economy as a whole, part-time employment is high, but independent observers say that has to do with the recession and the weak recovery rather than Obama&rsquo;s health care law. We rate the Americans For Prosperity claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-06T14:59:34.876121", "ruling_date": "2013-11-06T16:34:53", "ruling_headline": "Conservative group says Mary Landrieu backs Obamacare even as it decreases full-time employment", "ruling_headline_slug": "conservative-group-says-mary-landrieu-backs-obamac", "ruling_link_text": "Attack on Landrieu oversold at best", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Americans For Prosperity, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5ZQ8KU49dE\"><u>television ad</u></a>, first aired Oct. 29, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wall Street Journal, &quot;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324616604578304072420873666\"><u>Obamacare and the 29ers</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 26, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wall Street Journal, &quot;<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/10/22/dont-blame-health-law-for-high-part-time-employment/?mod=wsj_nview_latest\"><u>Don&rsquo;t Blame Health Law for High Part-Time Unemployment</u></a>,&quot; Oct. 22, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email interview with Levi Russel, Directory of Public Affairs for Americans For Prosperity, Nov. 4, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, September Jobs Report, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf\"><u>The Employment Situation -- September 2013</u></a>, Oct. 22, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investor&rsquo;s Business Daily, &quot;<a href=\"http://news.investors.com/politics-obamacare/101713-669013-obamacare-employer-mandate-a-list-of-cuts-to-work-hours-jobs.htm\"><u>Obamacare Employer Mandate: A List of Cuts to Work Hours, Jobs</u></a>,&quot; Oct. 17, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/22/maria-bartiromo/bartiromo-says-obamacare-turning-us-part-time-empl/\"><u>Bartiromo says Obamacare is turning us into &#39;a part-time employment country,&#39;</u></a> Oct. 20, 2013</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 6, "current_job": "", "false_count": 8, "first_name": "", "half_true_count": 2, "home_state": "", "id": 343, "last_name": "Americans for Prosperity", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "americans-prosperity", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AFP-image-80.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/343/", "total_count": 19, "true_count": 0, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>Says &quot;new mandates are already reducing full-time employment.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a television ad", "statement_date": "2013-10-29", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
