Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., claimed the debt doubled under George W. Bush and is tripling under President Obama. We rated it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/09/rand-paul/rand-paul-debt-has-tripled-bush-took-office/\">Half True</a> -- the debt under Obama has tripled since Bush took office, but other factors affect debt.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, we wondered, as Obama&rsquo;s presidency comes to a close, where are we now in terms of debt?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Important context</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pence spokesman Marc Lotter pointed us to the Treasury Department&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current\">Debt to the Penny clock</a>, a real-time look at the nation&rsquo;s debt that goes back almost two decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Jan. 20, 2009, when Obama took office, the gross federal debt (which includes both public and intragovernmental debt) was $10.63 trillion. As of Aug. 3, 2016, it is <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/search?startMonth=01&amp;startDay=20&amp;startYear=2009&amp;endMonth=08&amp;endDay=04&amp;endYear=2016\">$19.4 trillion</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the numbers check out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But experts we spoke with still note that the debt cannot be pinned on just Obama. For one thing, Congress signs off on spending and taxation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, reining in government spending during the recession would have been a bad idea, economists told us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>George Washington University law professor Neil Buchanan noted that the economy was in &quot;free-fall&quot; when Obama took office. In Arizona, the housing market crashed and key sector jobs, such as construction, dried up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tax revenues were plummeting, because incomes were falling, while spending had to go up (for unemployment benefits, Medicaid, and so on),&quot; Buchanan said. &quot;Had we tried to balance the budget during that time, it would have accelerated the downturn, and there could have been a depression.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, according to Bucknell University economics professor Gregory Krohn, the Congressional Budget Office projected in January that debt held by the public would increase to <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/51129-2016_Outlook_Summary.pdf\">75.6 percent </a>- up from 39.3 percent in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Debt held by the public, a more meaningful measure, more than doubled from $6.4 trillion to $13.9 trillion over the same period,&quot; Krohn said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pence said that under the Obama administration, &quot;the debt has nearly doubled.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His numbers are on the mark. But it is important to note that the debt cannot all be blamed on Obama. Congress has a role in approving spending. And, experts told us that money needed to be spent in a free-falling economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate Pence&rsquo;s claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/74377f97-8d5a-4dd0-b0c1-12c13563759c\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/74377f97-8d5a-4dd0-b0c1-12c13563759c</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-08-09T12:52:03.369356", "ruling_date": "2016-08-09T17:20:38", "ruling_headline": "Mike Pence claims national debt has nearly doubled under President Obama ", "ruling_headline_slug": "mike-pence-claims-national-debt-has-nearly-doubled", "ruling_link_text": "Not all because of Obama", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC15, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/republican-vice-presidential-nominee-mike-pence-makes-campaign-stop-in-tucson-phoenix\">Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence makes campaign stop in Tucson, Phoenix</a>,&quot; Aug. 2, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/09/rand-paul/rand-paul-debt-has-tripled-bush-took-office/\">Rand Paul: Debt doubled under Bush, tripled under Obama</a>,&quot; April 7, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury Department, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/search?startMonth=01&amp;startDay=20&amp;startYear=2009&amp;endMonth=08&amp;endDay=04&amp;endYear=2016\">The daily history of the debt results</a>,&quot; accessed Aug. 4, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Pence spokesman Marc Lotter, Aug. 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with George Washington University law professor Neil Buchanan, Aug. 3, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Bucknell University economics professor Gregory Krohn, Aug. 3 , 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congressional Budget Office, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/51129-2016_Outlook_Summary.pdf\">Summary of the budget and economic outlook: 2016 to 2016</a>,&quot; Jan. 19, 2016</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Pence", "barely_true_count": 8, "current_job": "Governor", "false_count": 14, "first_name": "Mike", "half_true_count": 15, "home_state": "Indiana", "id": 124, "last_name": "Pence", "mostly_true_count": 6, "name_slug": "mike-pence", "pants_count": 1, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AP_VASH107_CAMPAIGN_2016_PE.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/124/", "total_count": 49, "true_count": 5, "website": "http://www.in.gov/gov/2358.htm"}, "statement": "<p>Says that under the Obama administration, &quot;the debt has nearly doubled.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a Phoenix town hall", "statement_date": "2016-08-02", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [{"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}], "twitter_headline": ".@mike_pence claims the nation's debt has nearly doubled under President Obama.
