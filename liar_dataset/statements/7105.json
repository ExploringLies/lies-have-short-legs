Staging. Seats can be added to the field for Wrestlemania events, but not for Super Bowls, possibly giving WrestleMania a capacity advantage.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The difference between WrestleMania and Super Bowl staging is that WrestleMania has a stage much like a concert so seats behind the stage are unavailable but would be used for football,&quot; Kevin Hennessy, WWE senior director of publicity, said in an e-mail. &quot;However, for WrestleMania, seats are added to field level which would not be done for football. That is why we feel justified in making the comparison.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat was the case at Glendale, Ariz.&rsquo;s University of Phoenix Stadium, where temporary seats were added for WrestleMania in 2010, spokesman Scott Norton said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAnd New Jerseyans have a reason to care about ticket sales when both events come to MetLife Stadium: ticket sales equal economic impact.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;According to the NY/NJ Super Bowls Host Committee (headed by CEO Al Kelly) approximately 150,000 out-of-town visitors will attend non-game events and that the region will have approximately 400,000 people total who will attend events related to Super Bowl activities that are not the actual Super Bowl game,&quot; Wayne Hasenbalg, president and CEO of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, said in an e-mail.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;According to a SMRI (Sports Management Research Institute) economic study, the recent Super Bowl in Indianapolis (XLVI) had a $155 million economic impact on the central Indiana region,&quot; Hasenbalg continued. &quot;The SMRI estimates $550 million in regional economic impact for our Super Bowl (XLVIII).&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe SMRI did not return a call for comment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWrestleMania 28&rsquo;s economic impact on Miami this past April totaled $103 million, according to a report assessing the event&rsquo;s financial impact on that city.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWWE executive Paul Levesque, better known by his stage name Triple H, said in a recent interview that &quot;we&rsquo;ve outdrawn the Super Bowl for a little while now in the arenas and stadiums that we&rsquo;ve followed them in for the Super Bowl. We&rsquo;ve gone in after [the NFL] and surpassed their ticket sales.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn terms of attendance, Levesque is largely correct: WrestleMania sold more tickets than the Super Bowl in five of the six stadiums where WrestleMania was held after a Super Bowl. It&#39;s worth noting, however, that since WrestleMania&#39;s staging is similar to a concert&#39;s, field seating may be added to compensate for lost seating behind the WrestleMania stage.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLevesque&rsquo;s claim rates Mostly True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this story, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/11/politifact_nj_with_jersey_on_i.html\">NJ.com</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-11-20T14:29:22.925457", "ruling_date": "2012-11-22T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "With Jersey on the itinerary for both events, wrestler Triple H says WrestleMania has surpassed Super Bowl ticket sales", "ruling_headline_slug": "jersey-itinerary-both-events-wrestler-triple-h-say", "ruling_link_text": "WrestleMania 5, Super Bowl 1", "ruling_state": "New Jersey", "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tNYPost.com, &quot;WWE&rsquo;s Triple H talks Wrestlemania 29,&quot; Nov. 8, 2012, accessed Nov. 9, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Patrick Arthur, spokesman, Sun Life Stadium, Miami, Nov. 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Scott Norton, spokesman, University of Phoenix Stadium, Glendale, Ariz., Nov. 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPhone and e-mail interviews with Rob McBurnett, spokesman, National Football League, Nov. 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSuper Bowl XLVI 2011 Postseason Media Guide, accessed Nov. 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWWE Corporate website, &quot;Wreslemania XXVII Breaks Records,&quot; April 3, 2011, accessed Nov. 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWWE Corporate website, &quot;Wrestlemania XXVI Breaks Record,&quot; March 28, 2010, accessed Nov. 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWWE Corporate website, &quot;Wrestlemania Blows Away Attendance Record At Ford Fields,&quot; April 1, 2007, accessed Nov. 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWWE Corporate website, &quot;Wrestlemania XIX Breaks Attendance Record At Safeco Field,&quot; March 30, 2003, accessed Nov. 15, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Kevin Hennessy, WWE senior director of publicity, Nov. 19, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tE-mail interview with Wayne Hasenbalg, president and CEO, New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, Nov. 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWrestleMania XXVIII Economic Impact Assessment report, accessed Nov. 20, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSports Management Research Institute website, accessed Nov. 20, 2012</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "Executive vice president, Talent Relations and Live Events", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Paul", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Connecticut", "id": 2092, "last_name": "Levesque", "mostly_true_count": 1, "name_slug": "paul-levesque", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 2, "party": "None", "party_slug": "none", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/2/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Paul_Levesque_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "New Jersey", "edition": "New Jersey", "edition_slug": "new-jersey", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 13, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The New Jersey Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/13/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/2092/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://www.corporate.wwe.com/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;We&rsquo;ve outdrawn the Super Bowl for a little while now in the arenas and stadiums that we&rsquo;ve followed them in for the Super Bowl.
