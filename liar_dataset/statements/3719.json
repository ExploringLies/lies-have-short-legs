Cantor rejected increasing tax rates. But he acknowledged &nbsp;the need for a &quot;pro-growth tax proposal&quot; that would eliminate some special interest tax deductions and loopholes to modestly increase revenue.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We also have a situation in this country where you&#39;re nearing 50 percent of people who don&#39;t even pay income taxes,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIs it true that half of all Americans pay no income tax? Let&rsquo;s take a look.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, a technical note. When Cantor says people, he means &quot;tax-filing units,&quot; which refers to individuals or couples that either file a tax return or would have if they had earned enough income, according to his staff. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTo support his assertion, Cantor&rsquo;s camp provided a variety of studies and media reports that do indicate about 50 percent of U.S. households owed no federal income tax in 2009 -- the most recent year tax data are available.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 2009, for example, the Tax Policy Center projected 47 percent of people would pay no income tax that year, up from previous estimates of 38 percent -- largely due to additional tax credits through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, that&rsquo;s a bit dated. Anything newer?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Joint Committee on Taxation, sent a <a href=\"http://finance.senate.gov/newsroom/ranking/download/?id=9fe27e9f-a5e0-4010-8461-ffc00b5c00ef\">letter to </a><a href=\"http://finance.senate.gov/newsroom/ranking/download/?id=9fe27e9f-a5e0-4010-8461-ffc00b5c00ef\">Congress </a>on the matter only days after Cantor&rsquo;s &quot;Squawk Box&quot; appearance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tUsing 2009 tax data, the committee estimated that slightly more than 50 percent of tax-filing units actually paid no income tax.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;In summary, for tax year 2009, approximately 22 percent of all tax units, including filers and non filers, will have zero income tax liability, approximately 30 percent will receive a refundable tax credit, and approximately 49 percent will have a positive income tax liability,&quot; the letter reads.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;That&rsquo;s consistent with the numbers we&rsquo;ve come up with,&quot; said Roberton Williams with the Tax Policy Center. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;The main reason is the fact that we don&rsquo;t specifically use the tax system to collect taxes; we use it for tax collections and to deliver social policy,&quot; he said. &quot;Because of that we end up giving people money that could be provided to them through spending programs.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut because the U.S. uses the tax system to distribute money, it reduces the tax liability for 51 percent of tax filing units to, or below, zero.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWilliams said that&rsquo;s largely due to popular tax breaks, or tax expenditures. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;There are lots and lots of them. We estimate they total more than a trillion dollars a year in reduced taxes and in fact the bulk of those go to the top end of the income distribution,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEven so, because high earners have so much income liability, the breaks still don&rsquo;t bring them down to zero. But popular lower and middle income breaks like earned income tax credits, child credits and mortgage interest deductions do get a majority of the population off the hook. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo let&rsquo;s look back.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCantor acknowledged the need for eliminating certain tax loopholes and deductions while also pointing out that &quot;we also have a situation in this country where you&#39;re nearing 50 percent of people who don&#39;t even pay income taxes.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNot only are we nearing that situation, but as the Joint Committee on Taxation pointed out shortly after Cantor&rsquo;s statement, we moved beyond it. So we find the Majority Leader&rsquo;s statement True.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-05-09T09:45:12.465536", "ruling_date": "2011-05-09T09:43:05", "ruling_headline": "Eric Cantor says almost 50 percent of Americans don't pay income taxes", "ruling_headline_slug": "eric-cantor-says-almost-50-percent-americans-dont-", "ruling_link_text": "Deductions cut liabilities", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tCNBC&rsquo;s &quot;Squawk Box,&quot; <a href=\"about:blank\">Eric Cantor interview</a>, April 27, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJoint Committee on Taxation, <a href=\"http://finance.senate.gov/newsroom/ranking/download/?id=9fe27e9f-a5e0-4010-8461-ffc00b5c00ef\">Letter to Congress</a>, April 29, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tTax Policy Center, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/url.cfm?ID=1001289\">Who Pays no Income Tax</a>,&quot; July 2, 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, &quot;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703703304576299560728821804.html?mod=ITP_pageone_2#articleTabs%3Darticle\">High-Earning Households Pay Growing Share of Taxes</a>,&quot; May 3, 2011.</p>", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 9, "current_job": "House Majority Leader", "false_count": 6, "first_name": "Eric", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 118, "last_name": "Cantor", "mostly_true_count": 4, "name_slug": "eric-cantor", "pants_count": 4, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/AP_DCSA133_DEBT_SHOWDOWN.JPG", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/118/", "total_count": 36, "true_count": 7, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\tThere is &quot;a situation in this country where you&#39;re nearing 50 percent of people who don&#39;t even pay income taxes.&quot;</p>", "statement_context": "an appearance on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\"", "statement_date": "2011-04-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
