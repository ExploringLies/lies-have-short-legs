Romney&rsquo;s announcement that he&rsquo;s seriously assessing a third White House bid has revived a conversation topic that bedeviled him the last go around -- that he&rsquo;s too steeped in cash to connect with the struggles of the average American and benefits from a lopsided tax code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Sunday, former Gov. Jennifer Granholm, D-Mich., gave a sign of what Romney can expect. Romney had told a gathering of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/01/16/romney-moving-toward-2016-run-outlines-vision-to-eradicate-poverty/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Republicans in San Diego</u></a> a couple days before<strong> </strong>that under Obama, &quot;the rich have gotten richer, income inequality has gotten worse, and there are more people in poverty than ever before.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Granholm said in sticking up for the little guy, Romney had an &quot;authenticity problem.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You know, he pays less tax than the guys who installed his car elevators,&quot; Granholm said<strong> </strong>on ABC News&rsquo; <em><a href=\"http://abcn.ws/1B7NFOI\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>This Week</u></a></em>. We decide to look into that claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Echoes of 2012</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What car elevators, you might ask? In the spring of 2012, the public learned that Romney&rsquo;s plans for a multimillion dollar beach house in La Jolla, Calif., included an <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/05/romneys-car-elevator-cost-124588.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>elevator to move cars</u></a> from the basement to street level. Think of it as a way to get more than one car into a one-car garage. This add-on costs about $55,000 fully installed. (Construction on the site is underway, and we don&rsquo;t know if the elevators are done yet.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Needless to say, this was an unwanted, if minor, distraction for the Romney campaign<strong>, </strong>which was already dealing with calls to be more transparent about the governor&rsquo;s financial assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of his presidential campaign, the former Massachusetts governor released two years of income tax returns. They showed that in 2010, he paid 13.9 percent of his reported income&nbsp;in federal taxes and in 2011, 15.3 percent. Those rates were a bit less than the national average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t have all the details on his tax bills. The 2011 return was incomplete, and there was the possibility that Romney&rsquo;s actual tax rate would be less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that caveat, these are the best numbers we have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Granholm&rsquo;s comment mirrored a running theme from the 2012 election that the tax code treats income from work and income from investments differently. Above a certain point, income from work is taxed at a higher rate than income from the stock market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/sep/21/does-secretary-pay-higher-taxes-millionaire/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Billionaire Warren Buffett</u></a> memorably distilled this down to the line that he paid a lower tax rate than his secretary thanks to the favorable treatment of capital gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Elevator installers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assessing whether the men who installed the elevators paid more in taxes than Romney is difficult. We reached out to Granholm and did not hear back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We take her words to refer to tax rates, not the total tax amounts. Romney made about $22 million a year and paid millions in taxes both years. From the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_41740.htm#49-0000\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Bureau of Labor Statistics</u></a>, we see that in the San Diego metro area, the average elevator installer earned $83,460 in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What an installer paid in taxes varies based on a number of factors, including family situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the installers were single with no children, then a <a href=\"http://www.calcxml.com/calculators/federal-income-tax-calculator?skn=#top\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>simple tax calculator</u></a> gives them an effective federal income tax rate of 17 percent. If they were married and had a child, and had no other income, the rate would fall to 8.4 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, not only is that a bare-bones estimate, it fails to include payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. These payments represent a substantial portion of taxes paid by the average worker. The Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, uses a complicated tax simulator to estimate the total tax burden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tax Policy Center <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?DocID=3930\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>table for 2014</u></a> gives a total effective tax rate of 15.7 percent for households making between $75,000 and $100,000 a year. Take this number only as a rough guide. It includes various kinds of income, as well as a range of tax effects, and it blends together single as well as married filers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Comparing tax rates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The point is, Granholm&#39;s claim could be right or wrong -- it just depends on a person&#39;s individual circumstances.&nbsp;A single, childless elevator installer with wages at the higher end of the scale might be paying at a higher rate than Romney did in 2011. That person&#39;s, even before payroll taxes, could be as high as 17 percent compared to Romney&rsquo;s 15.3 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, someone married and caring for a child could be paying as little as 8.4 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Granholm said that Romney paid less tax than the guys that installed his car elevator.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the most literal level, we don&#39;t even know if the car elevators have been installed. And we don&#39;t know anything about the people who did the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a broader sense, what elevator installers pay&nbsp;in federal taxes depends on their personal circumstances. They could be taxed at a higher -- or lower -- rate than Romney has been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This statement is partially accurate.&nbsp;We rate it Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-01-18T13:15:04.715291", "ruling_date": "2015-01-18T18:23:12", "ruling_headline": "Michigan Democrat: Romney 'pays less tax than the guys who installed his car elevators'", "ruling_headline_slug": "former-michigan-gov-romney-pays-less-tax-guys-who-", "ruling_link_text": "Possible, but Granholm is guessing", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>ABC News, <em><a href=\"http://abcn.ws/1B7NFOI\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>This Week</u></a></em>, Jan. 18, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_41740.htm#49-0000\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>May 2013 Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Area Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates San Diego-Carlsbad-San Marcos, CA</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.calcxml.com/calculators/federal-income-tax-calculator?skn=#top\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2014 Federal income tax calculator</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tax Policy Center, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?DocID=3930\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Average effective federal tax rates</u></a>, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politico, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/05/romneys-car-elevator-cost-124588.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Romney&#39;s car elevator cost $55,000</u></a>, May 25, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Los Angeles Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-0116-abcarian-mitt-romney-20150116-column.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Revisiting the Romneys&#39; La Jolla beach house -- and its car elevator</u></a>, Jan. 15, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/01/16/romney-moving-toward-2016-run-outlines-vision-to-eradicate-poverty/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Romney, moving toward 2016 run, outlines vision to eradicate poverty</u></a>, Jan. 16, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Factcheck.org, <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2012/08/does-romney-pay-a-lower-rate-in-taxes-than-you/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Does Romney Pay a Lower Rate in Taxes Than You?</u></a>, Aug. 3, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Mother Jones</em>, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/what-we-still-dont-know-about-mitt-romneys-tax-returns\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>What We Still Don&#39;t Know About Mitt Romney&#39;s Tax Returns</u></a>, Jan. 15, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IRS, <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats---Individual-Statistical-Tables-by-Filing-Status#_grp2\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>SOI Tax Stats - Individual Statistical Tables by Filing Status</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>New York Times</em>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/us/president-obama-will-seek-to-reduce-taxes-for-middle-class.html?_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Obama Will Seek to Raise Taxes on Wealthy to Finance Cuts for Middle Class</u></a>, Jan. 17, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/sep/21/does-secretary-pay-higher-taxes-millionaire/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Does a secretary pay higher taxes than a millionaire?</u></a>, Sept. 21, 2011</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 1, "current_job": "Former governor of Michigan", "false_count": 0, "first_name": "Jennifer", "half_true_count": 3, "home_state": "Michigan", "id": 1382, "last_name": "Granholm", "mostly_true_count": 2, "name_slug": "jennifer-granholm", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Granholm_mug.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/1382/", "total_count": 7, "true_count": 1, "website": "http://jennifergranholm.com/"}, "statement": "<p>Says Mitt Romney &quot;pays less tax than the guys who installed his car elevators.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on ABC's \"This Week\"", "statement_date": "2015-01-18", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 8, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/8/", "subject": "Taxes", "subject_slug": "taxes", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
