Other methods show less impressive growth in jobs -- even declines.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst of all, Clinton was using private-sector job figures, not total job figures. Right off the bat, that paints Obama&rsquo;s numbers favorably, since government jobs have declined during much of Obama&rsquo;s term. If you count from the start of Obama&rsquo;s term, private-sector jobs have increased by 332,000, but total jobs have decreased by 316,000 due to losses of government jobs.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSince this time frame includes the start of Obama&rsquo;s term -- when the economy was in free fall and before Obama&rsquo;s policies had time to take effect -- we don&rsquo;t think this is the best way to measure it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe way Clinton did it is another way to count it. Clinton started counting from the low point of jobs in February 2010. Using this method, private-sector jobs increased by about 4.5 million.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHowever, starting the count at the low point is a bit of cherry-picking.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf you instead start at the official end of the recession in June 2009, private-sector jobs increased by 3.4 million. That&rsquo;s well below Clinton&rsquo;s 4.5 million figure.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe realize that speakers at political conventions are going to put the best gloss on the numbers they have available, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that Clinton would use the 4.5 million figure. But getting to 4.5 million requires starting the count at the most favorable point possible for Obama.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn addition, as we&rsquo;ve written previously, presidents are not the only factor in job creation. The national, and world, economies are too big for any one person to control. So crediting Obama&rsquo;s policies is at best partially correct because there are so many other factors -- such as policies of the Federal Reserve, the willingness of banks to lend money, and global business trends -- that play a role.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile it&rsquo;s true that by most measures, the number of jobs in the United States has increased on Obama&rsquo;s watch, Clinton has done some cherry-picking in coming up with the 4.5 million number. But he chose his words carefully in describing the jobs picture. He said, &quot;In the last 29 months, our economy has produced about 4.5 million private-sector jobs.&quot; On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-09-06T11:21:35.841421", "ruling_date": "2012-09-06T12:40:12", "ruling_headline": "Bill Clinton says 4.5 million jobs have been created under Barack Obama", "ruling_headline_slug": "bill-clinton-says-45-million-jobs-have-been-create", "ruling_link_text": "Number is cherry-picked, but accurately described", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tBill Clinton, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/us/politics/transcript-of-bill-clintons-speech-to-the-democratic-national-convention.html?pagewanted=all\">speech</a> to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, Sep. 4, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNational Bureau of Economic Research, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.nber.org/cycles.html\">US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions</a>,&quot; accessed Sept. 5, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/ces/\">Current Employment Statistics (main index page),</a> accessed Sept. 5, 2012<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "former president", "false_count": 2, "first_name": "Bill", "half_true_count": 12, "home_state": "Arkansas", "id": 32, "last_name": "Clinton", "mostly_true_count": 11, "name_slug": "bill-clinton", "pants_count": 3, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/mugs/mug-billclinton.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/32/", "total_count": 42, "true_count": 9, "website": ""}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;In the last 29 months, our economy has produced about 4.5 million private-sector jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a speech to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.", "statement_date": "2012-09-05", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 4, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/4/", "subject": "Economy", "subject_slug": "economy", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
