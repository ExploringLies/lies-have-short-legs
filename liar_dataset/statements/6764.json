The article has been amended. The rating of the statement is unaffected.</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tGov. Rick Perry posted a photo the other day showing &quot;$16 trillion&quot; inked across the back of his hands. In a Sept. 20, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.rickperry.org/blog/retweet-governor-perrys-forall-message\">Twitter post</a> linking to the photo, Perry said: &quot;Since @BarackObama has forgotten how much he&#39;s added to national debt #ForAll our kids to pay off.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThat day, the federal debt <a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np\">exceeded</a> $16 trillion, according to the Treasury&rsquo;s Debt to the Penny calculator. That total counted $4.8 trillion in intragovernmental debt and $11.3 trillion in public debt, money borrowed from outside the government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy email, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us Perry&rsquo;s tweet was reminding the president of the debt total &quot;since he couldn&rsquo;t seem to remember it a few days ago.&quot; She was referring to Obama&rsquo;s Sept. 18, 2012, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htUp1S4DV54&amp;feature=player_embedded\">appearance</a> on CBS-TV&rsquo;s &quot;Late Show with David Letterman.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn the relevant segment, Letterman mentioned the live-action national debt clock featured at the Republican National Convention and asked Obama what it was about. Obama said factors feeding the debt included two wars not funded up front, renewed federal tax cuts and expenditures reacting to the financial crisis of 2008-09.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLetterman, returning to the debt clock, then asked: &quot;Now, do you remember what that number was? Was it $10 trillion?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;No,&quot; Obama replied, &quot;I don&rsquo;t remember what the number was, precisely.&rsquo;&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAsked if &quot;we&quot; should be scared by the rising debt, Obama said: &quot;We don&rsquo;t have to worry about it (the debt) short-term&quot; due to low U.S. interest rates, though he called the debt a medium-to-long-term problem.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFrazier&rsquo;s email also said Obama has added about $5 trillion to the debt in less than four years. The increase since Obama became president in January 2009 is about $5.4 trillion, compared to the $10.6 trillion in debt on his inauguration day, Jan. 20, 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhile <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/jul/19/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-national-debt-doubled-under-georg/\">rating Mostly True</a> a June 2012 claim by Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Paul Sadler that the national debt doubled while George W.

Sahr <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/texas/article/2012/aug/03/tracking-federal-debt-change-truman-obama/\">later provided</a> a chart showing changes in the public debt under each president since Harry Truman.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe asked Frazier if Perry&rsquo;s tweet was intended to saddle Obama with responsibility for all the debt.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf &quot;you want to split hairs, go right ahead,&quot; Frazier replied. &quot;I&#39;ve explained to you the intent behind the governor&rsquo;s tweet... It is widely known that the national debt is&quot; $16 trillion &quot;and climbing and that is what the governor was referring to. At least he recognizes the real figure, while President Obama is either oblivious or chooses to ignore it.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOur friends at PolitiFact Wisconsin <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/12/reid-ribble/president-obama-built-nations-16-trillion-debt-gop/\">recently rated</a> as False a claim by U.S. Rep.
