Mitt Romney as a serial flip-flopper. The shorter,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUOM9QvhG5I&amp;feature=player_embedded\">30-second version</a>&nbsp;gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mittvmitt.com/\">four-minute version</a>&nbsp;that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor this item, we&rsquo;ll check one of the claims from the four-minute version -- specifically, whether Romney has changed his position on signing a taxpayer protection pledge. We&#39;re looking at other aspects of the ad in separate items.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the relevant portion from the DNC ad:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Screen text</strong>: Will not sign pledge</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Audio of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0203/28/ip.00.html\">Candy Crowley</a></strong>: &quot;Republican Mitt Romney says he will not sign a no-new-taxes pledge.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Screen text</strong>: Then he did</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Audio from Romney radio ad</strong>: &quot;I&rsquo;m proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe first clip refers to an announcement during Romney&rsquo;s 2002 gubernatorial campaign that he would not sign a pledge circulated by Citizens for Limited Taxation, a Massachusetts-based anti-tax group.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s how the <em>Boston Globe</em> covered the news:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;In a break with Acting Governor Jane Swift and her GOP predecessors, Republican gubernatorial candidate Mitt Romney is refusing to rule out tax increases and said yesterday he will not sign a &lsquo;no new taxes&rsquo; pledge,&quot; the newspaper wrote. &quot;Romney said that while he opposes all tax increases in principle, he will not make such a pledge in writing.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe article went on to quote Romney saying, &quot;I am not in favor of increasing taxes. &hellip; At this stage, I am inclined to make that position as clear as I can but not to enter into a written pledge of some kind, and that&#39;s true on this and other issues.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe <em>Globe </em>cited another comment by Romney that had been reported by the <em>Union-News</em> of Springfield, Mass. &quot;I&#39;m against tax increases,&quot; Romney told attendees of Western Massachusetts GOP meeting, according to the <em>Union-News</em>. &quot;But I&#39;m not intending to, at this stage, sign a document which would prevent me from being able to look specifically at the revenue needs of the Commonwealth.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBarbara Anderson, an official with Citizens for Limited Taxation, was unhappy with Romney&#39;s refusal to sign, which came after he&rsquo;d met with her for half an hour. &quot;He&#39;s thinking like an independent businessman who doesn&#39;t sign pledges,&quot; she suggested to the <em>Globe</em>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMeanwhile, the <em>Boston Herald</em> quoted then Romney deputy campaign manager Eric Fehrnstrom saying, &quot;Mitt Romney doesn&#39;t have to sign a piece of paper to have a position on an issue. He&#39;s pledged to oppose any tax increase, he doesn&#39;t support them, his position on taxes is clear.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn an interview with the <em>Globe</em>, Fehrnstrom was even more dismissive, calling the pledge &quot;government by gimmickry,&quot; the newspaper reported.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPut it all together and you have a candidate who didn&rsquo;t just decide against signing a pledge but who cast doubt on the propriety of such pledges in general.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNow we&rsquo;ll fast-forward a few years, when Romney, having finished a term as governor of Massachusetts, was running for president. On Dec. 31, 2006, Romney became the first major candidate for the 2008 election to sign a taxpayer protection pledge offered by Americans for Tax Reform, the anti-tax group headed by Grover Norquist.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;In signing the pledge, Gov. Romney firmly commits himself in writing to fiscal discipline and economic common sense,&quot; Norquist said in a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.atr.org/mitt-romney-signs-taxpayer-protection-pledge-a1872\">news release</a>. &quot;Mitt Romney has told taxpayers in no uncertain terms that he plans to look out for their interests.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tRomney hardly signed the Norquist pledge covertly. On Jan. 4, 2007, he issued a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=95745#axzz1f82C1yku\">press release</a>&nbsp;touting his action, and on Oct. 5, 2007, he released a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=96235#axzz1f81tfAVd\">radio ad</a>&nbsp;spotlighting it. That&rsquo;s where the DNC got the clip used in its ad.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;For years, conservative candidates for president signed their name on the dotted line pledging to oppose tax increases,&quot; Romney said in the ad. &quot;I&#39;m Mitt Romney. I&#39;m proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge. The others have not. I signed the tax pledge because I want everyone to know where I stand. We&#39;ve got to get taxes down and grow our economy. I believe it&#39;s not fair that you have to pay taxes when you earn your money, when you save your money and when you die. That&#39;s why I&#39;ll kill the death tax once and for all and roll back tax rates across the board. And savings? When I&#39;m president, for every middle class American, the new tax rate on your interest, dividends, and capital gains will be absolutely zero. I stood firm to roll back taxes as governor. I&#39;ll roll back taxes as president.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this case, then, Romney not only signed a written pledge but actively broadcast it to the electorate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s worth noting that the two pledges are not exactly the same. One addressed the state context and one the federal context.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Massachusetts text is a &quot;pledge to ... all the people of this state, that I will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Norquist pledge, to which Romney is still a signatory, requires the signer to &quot;oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses &hellip; and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStill, despite the differences in wording, we think the pledges are equivalent in their underlying requirements.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn 2002, Romney refused to make &quot;a pledge in writing&quot; on taxes. Four years later, he signed one and touted it as a selling point for his candidacy. In our book, that&rsquo;s a clear flip-flop. We rate the DNC&rsquo;s charge True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2011-11-29T16:17:48.626214", "ruling_date": "2011-11-29T16:51:15", "ruling_headline": "DNC ad says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on taxpayer pledge", "ruling_headline_slug": "dnc-ad-says-mitt-romney-flip-flopped-taxpayer-pled", "ruling_link_text": "He refused to sign one.
