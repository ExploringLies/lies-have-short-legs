Rick Scott is our salesman-in-chief when it comes to recruiting tourists. His office blasted a press release chock full of statistics about tourism in Florida that made us nod off like a lazy tourist on the beach -- until we came across this phrase:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;As we move toward our third consecutive year of record tourism growth, it is clear why the Sunshine State remains the top travel destination across the world,&quot; stated the Nov. 15 <a href=\"http://www.flgov.com/2013/11/15/gov-scott-another-record-for-florida-tourism/\">press release</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;top travel destination across the world&quot;? Is the home state of Mickey Mouse kicking the derriere of tourist hot spots like France? We went on a virtual trip to find out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Florida tourism stats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked a spokesman for Scott for an explanation as to how he arrived at his claim. John Tupps said Scott was simply expressing a personal opinion that Florida is the best place to visit in the whole world, not making a quantitative statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The governor truly believes Florida is the &lsquo;top travel destination&rsquo; in the world,&quot; Tupps said in an email. &quot;It&rsquo;s his personal view.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We thought Scott&rsquo;s wording went further than a personal opinion, though, so we decided put his statement on the Truth-O-Meter. We soon found that comparing tourism stats is tricky, because various states and countries use different methodologies to count visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit Florida, a quasi-state agency, counts out-of-state, overnight visitors. By that measurement, Florida had <a href=\"http://www.visitflorida.com/en-us/media/research.html\">91.5 million visitors</a> in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In California in 2012, there were 61 million out-of-state overnight trips. New York had about 62 million overnight out-of-state visitors in 2011, the most recent year available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So in state-to-state competition, Florida wins on the metric that Visit Florida uses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the picture changes when we look around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the U.N.&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_highlights13_en_lr_0.pdf\">World Tourism Organization</a>, in 2012, there were 83 million international visitors to France, compared with the United States in second place with 67 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So on the metric of international visitors, France is clearly leading Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We continue to say our goal is to beat France,&quot; said Kathy Torian, a spokeswoman for Visit Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the comparison of Florida with France is tricky, because France is a country and Florida is a state. Florida&rsquo;s 19 million population is about one-third the size of France&rsquo;s population of about 66 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, many Europeans travel to France just for a weekend, or visitors book a short stay in France, and then move on to other European destinations. So France may not be as dominant as its visitor counts make it appear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comparing the number of visitors is not the only way to compare tourism rankings. We could also examine the amount of money spent by visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And while France is No. 1 in the number of international visitors, it tumbles behind the United States and Spain when you consider spending, the <a href=\"http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2013/jul/28/ref-ining-french-charm/\">AP</a> reported:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;International visitors spent more than double in the U.S. than they did in France in 2012 &ndash; $126.2 billion, compared to $53.7 billion, according to the U.N.&rsquo;s World Tourism Organization. That despite the fact that France welcomed 20 percent more tourists.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Travel Association reports that travel spending was <a href=\"http://traveleffect.com/economy#fl\">$71.5 billion in Florida</a> in 2011. That amount lags behind <a href=\"http://traveleffect.com/economy#ca\">California</a>, at $105 billion in 2011. Both those numbers top France&#39;s $53.7 billion in 2012. But to Scott&#39;s point, those spending numbers still don&#39;t put Florida in the No. 1 position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While touting Florida&rsquo;s tourism numbers, Scott said, &quot;The Sunshine State remains the top travel destination across the world.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There isn&rsquo;t one simple way to declare &quot;the&quot; top travel destination in the world. But Scott&rsquo;s claim would probably elicit a &quot;<em>mais non!</em>&quot; from Scott&rsquo;s counterparts in France, who can boast to being the undisputed global leader of international tourists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you don&#39;t consider France a fair comparison, recent data on travel spending shows that California edges out Florida.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit Florida is clamoring to achieve that No. 1 ranking, but we didn&rsquo;t find proof that we are already there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott is clearly a cheerleader for his own state, but the data to back up his claim is murky and difficult to substantiate. We rate the claim Mostly False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-11-21T12:15:18.200086", "ruling_date": "2013-11-21T16:48:57", "ruling_headline": "Rick Scott declares Florida 'the top travel destination across the world'", "ruling_headline_slug": "rick-scott-declares-florida-top-travel-destination", "ruling_link_text": "France and California have claims here", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>U.N.
