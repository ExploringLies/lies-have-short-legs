Are you planning a surprise party for us? Filled with jobs and health care?&quot; Stewart asked.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama then listed a string of accomplishments, including this one: &quot;Before we even passed health care, 4 millions kids got health insurance that didn&#39;t have it before, through the Children&#39;s Health Insurance Program.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tYou might not remember it, but an expansion to the state Children&#39;s Health Insurance Program became law very early in Obama&#39;s presidency. The program provides insurance to children in families who aren&#39;t poor enough to qualify for Medicaid but can&#39;t afford private insurance.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPresident George W. Bush had vetoed the legislation twice in 2007, on the grounds that it increased tobacco taxes and would expand government-run health insurance programs to the middle class. Obama signed the law on Feb. 9, 2009.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow, what about the 4 million kids? Was it really that many?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office calculated in 2007 that the law would expand eligibility to 3.8 million children but that would be after the new law had been in place four years. Obama&#39;s bill has been in place just under two years, so it likely hasn&#39;t increased by that much. Because the program is administered by the states, the most recently available national enrollment figures on the program are from June 2009. They show, as we would expect, only a modest increase in the program&#39;s enrollment.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn ruling on our statement, Obama is correct to claim credit for signing the Children&#39;s Health Insurance Program into law after Bush had vetoed it. But he was exaggerating by using the 4 million estimate prematurely. It will take awhile for the program to reach its projected enrollment. So we rate his statement Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-10-28T18:24:31.039444", "ruling_date": "2010-10-28T18:48:10", "ruling_headline": "Obama said he got health care insurance for 4 million kids ", "ruling_headline_slug": "obama-said-he-got-health-care-insurance-4-million-", "ruling_link_text": "Yes, but even this takes time.", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tU.S. House of Representatives, <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll016.xml\"> Roll call vote for SCHIP </a> , Jan. 14, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWashington Post, &quot; <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/14/AR2009011403241.html\"> House Votes to Expand Child Health Insurance </a> ,&quot; Jan. 14, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhite House Web site, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog_post/chip/\"> CHIP </a> , accessed Feb. 4, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThomas, <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.00002:\"> SCHIP legislation </a> , accessed Feb. 4, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/86xx/doc8655/hr976.pdf\"> CBO&#39;s Estimate of the Effects on Direct Spending and Revenues of the House Amendments to the Senate Amendments to H.R. 976, the Children&#39;s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, </a> Sept. 25, 2007.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tCongressional Budget Office, <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/99xx/doc9985/hr2paygo.pdf\" id=\"yjcq\" title=\"H.R. 2, Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act \r\nof 2009\">H.R. 2, Children&#39;s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009</a>, Feb. 11, 2009<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tKaiser Family Foundation, <a href=\"http://www.statehealthfacts.org/comparemaptable.jsp?ind=236&amp;cat=4\" id=\"o6st\" title=\"Monthly CHIP enrollment\">Monthly CHIP enrollment</a>, accessed Oct. 28, 2010</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": "People ", "advalue": "Obama", "barely_true_count": 70, "current_job": "President", "false_count": 71, "first_name": "Barack", "half_true_count": 161, "home_state": "Illinois", "id": 4, "last_name": "Obama", "mostly_true_count": 165, "name_slug": "barack-obama", "pants_count": 9, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/NYT_OBAMA_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/4/", "total_count": 631, "true_count": 123, "website": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"}, "statement": "<p>\r\n\t&quot;Before we even passed health care, 4 millions kids got health insurance that didn&#39;t have it before, through the Children&#39;s Health Insurance Program.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "an interview on \"The Daily Show.\"", "statement_date": "2010-10-27", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 119, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/119/", "subject": "Families", "subject_slug": "families", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2016 election, Republicans and their presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, the landmark federal health care law passed by Democrats in 2010.
