Tolbert has read and analyzed all the major health proposals, including those of the Republicans, and the foundation provides\n <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/healthreform/sidebyside.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">\n  point-by-point analyses\n </a>\n of the plans on its Web site.\n</p>\n<p>\n \"No one's provided with free health care. That's ridiculous,\" she said.\n</p>\n<p>\n Page 50, which the e-mail references, is part of Section 152, which includes a generic nondiscrimination clause saying that insurers may not discriminate with regard to \"personal characteristics extraneous to the provision of high quality health care or related services.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n The section says nothing about \"non-US citizens\" or immigrants, legal or otherwise. In fact, the legislation specifically states that \"undocumented aliens\" will not be eligible for credits to help them buy health insurance, in Section 246 on page 143.\n</p>\n<p>\n The bottom line here is the e-mail is making things up.
