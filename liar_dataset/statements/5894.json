Here&rsquo;s our recap.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Full circle</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama was in favor of same-sex marriage before he was against it &mdash; and before he was for it again.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn 1996, as he ran for Illinois state Senate, Chicago&rsquo;s <em>Outlines</em> gay newspaper asked candidates to fill out a questionnaire. Tracy Baim, the co-founder and publisher of <em>Outlines</em>, dug up <a href=\"http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/images/publications/wct/2009-01-14/current.pdf\">a copy of the questionnaire</a> in 2009, cataloging the president-elect&rsquo;s shift.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe had written on the 1996 questionnaire, &quot;I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tJust two years later, on <a href=\"http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/images/publications/wct/2009-01-21/current.pdf\">another <em>Outlines</em> questionnaire</a>, Obama wasn&rsquo;t so sure. Did he favor legalizing same-sex marriage? &quot;Undecided.&quot; Would he support a bill to repeal Illinois legislation prohibiting same-sex marriage? &quot;Undecided.&quot; Would he co-sponsor it? &quot;Undecided.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tLater years offered greater clarity &mdash; and a shift from 1996. Civil unions? Yes. Gay marriage? No.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAs Obama sought a U.S. Senate seat in 2004, <a href=\"http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=3931\">he told the <em>Windy City Times</em></a>, &quot;I am a fierce supporter of domestic-partnership and civil-union laws. I am not a supporter of gay marriage as it has been thrown about, primarily just as a strategic issue. I think that marriage, in the minds of a lot of voters, has a religious connotation. ...&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe described his hesitation to endorse same-sex marriage as strategic and political.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;What I&#39;m saying is that strategically, I think we can get civil unions passed. &hellip; I think that to the extent that we can get the rights, I&#39;m less concerned about the name. &hellip; Republicans are going to use a particular language that has all sorts of connotations in the broader culture as a wedge issue, to prevent us moving forward, in securing those rights, then I don&#39;t want to play their game.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWhen he wrote his 2006 memoir, <em>The Audacity of Hope</em>, he offered a religious explanation for his definition of marriage as between a man and a woman. But he left the door open for yet another shift.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I believe that American society can choose to carve out a special place for the union of a man and a woman as the unit of child rearing most common to every culture. &hellip;&quot; he said. &quot;(But) it is my obligation not only as an elected official in a pluralistic society, but also as a Christian, to remain open to the possibility that my unwillingness to support gay marriage is misguided, just as I cannot claim infallibility in my support of abortion rights. I must admit that I may have been infected with society&#39;s prejudices and predilections and attributed them to God; that Jesus&#39; call to love one another might demand a different conclusion; and that in years hence I may be seen as someone who was on the wrong side of history.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe said his doubts didn&#39;t make him a bad Christian &mdash; but human, limited in his understanding of God&rsquo;s purpose and therefore &quot;prone to sin.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;When I read the Bible, I do so with the belief that it is not a static text but the Living Word and that I must continually be open to new revelations &mdash; whether they come from a lesbian friend or a doctor opposed to abortion.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tStill, in a 2007 <a href=\"http://www.issues2000.org/Archive/2007_HRC_LOGO_Barack_Obama.htm\">Democratic primary debate</a> sponsored by a gay rights group and a gay-oriented cable TV channel, he spoke instead about his support for civil unions with &quot;all the benefits that are available for a legally sanctioned marriage&quot; &mdash; but not for legal recognition of &quot;marriage&quot; between same-sex couples. It should be up to religious denominations to determine whether they wanted to recognize that as marriage or not, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn August 2008, he told Southern California megachurch Pastor Rick Warren his <a href=\"http://votesmart.org/public-statement/658545/full-transcript-saddleback-presidential-forum-sen-barack-obama-john-mccain-moderated-by-rick-warren/?search=saddleback\">definition of marriage</a>: &quot;I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, for me as a Christian, it is also a sacred union. God&#39;s in the mix.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe later added: &quot;I am not somebody who promotes same-sex marriage, but I do believe in civil unions.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn November 2008, he said much the same thing to a rather different audience: MTV.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBy October 2010, almost two years into his presidency, he acknowledged his views were evolving. But he wasn&rsquo;t prepared to reverse himself, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe told <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/1010/Obama_says_hes_evolving_on_gay_marriage.html\">a group of liberal bloggers</a>, &quot;I have been to this point unwilling to sign on to same-sex marriage primarily because of my understandings of the traditional definitions of marriage. But I also think you&rsquo;re right that attitudes evolve, including mine.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe offered an explanation that would presage his 2012 shift: &quot;I think that it is an issue that I wrestle with and think about because I have a whole host of friends who are in gay partnerships. I have staff members who are in committed, monogamous relationships, who are raising children, who are wonderful parents. &nbsp;And I care about them deeply. And so while I&rsquo;m not prepared to reverse myself here, sitting in the Roosevelt Room at 3:30 in the afternoon, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that it&rsquo;s something that I think a lot about. That&rsquo;s probably the best you&rsquo;ll do out of me today.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tA year and a half later, he announced the result of that wrestling and thinking.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Good Morning America</em> anchor Robin Roberts <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-robin-roberts-abc-news-interview-president-obama/story?id=16316043\">asked him on Wednesday</a>, &quot;Mr. President, are you still opposed to same-sex marriage?&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHe answered:<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n\t<em>Well, you know, I have to tell you, as I&#39;ve said, I&#39;ve been going through an evolution on this issue. I&#39;ve always been adamant that &mdash; gay and lesbian &mdash; Americans should be treated fairly and equally. And that&#39;s why in addition to everything we&#39;ve done in this administration, rolling back Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell &mdash; so that, you know, outstanding Americans can serve our country. Whether it&#39;s no longer defending the Defense Against Marriage Act, which tried to federalize what has historically been state law.</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n\t<em>I&#39;ve stood on the side of broader equality for the LGBT community. And I had hesitated on gay marriage &mdash; in part, because I thought civil unions would be sufficient. That that was something that would give people hospital visitation rights and other elements that we take for granted. And I was sensitive to the fact that for a lot of people, you know, the word marriage was something that evokes very powerful traditions, religious beliefs, and so forth.</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n\t<em>But I have to tell you that over the course of several years, as I talk to friends and family and neighbors. When I think about members of my own staff who are incredibly committed, in monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising kids together. When I think about those soldiers or airmen or marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet, feel constrained, even now that Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell is gone, because they&#39;re not able to commit themselves in a marriage.</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n\t<em>At a certain point, I&#39;ve just concluded that for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tObama, a consistent supporter of civil rights for gay couples, nevertheless said as early as 2004 and through 2008 that he didn&rsquo;t support same-sex marriage. He had written that he believed &quot;that American society can choose to carve out a special place for the union of a man and a woman.&quot; In 2010, he said he wasn&rsquo;t prepared to reverse himself. This week, the president said he thinks same-sex couples should be able to get married.
