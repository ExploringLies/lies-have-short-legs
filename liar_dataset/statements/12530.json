Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said most people suspected of terrorism in the United States haven&#39;t haven&#39;t found it difficult to purchase a weapon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Last year, 244 people on the terror watch list tried to purchase guns; 244 suspected terrorists walked into gun shops and attempted to purchase a firearm; 223 were able to get the firearm. Only 21 went empty-handed,&quot; Schumer said. &quot;Ninety-one percent of suspected terrorists, when they sought to purchase a gun, last year were successful, according to GAO.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GAO is the U.S. Government Accountability Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, some background on these &quot;suspected terrorists.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FBI&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/nsb/tsc/terrorist-screening-center-frequently-asked-questions\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Terrorist Screening Center</u></a> maintains a list of people &quot;known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity.&quot; This list is secret but it&#39;s believed to have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/06/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-700000-americans-could-be-affecte/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>around 700,000</u></a> names collected by U.S. and global agencies. It&#39;s estimated that 10,000 of those names are Americans and the rest are foreigners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We looked at this issue in December when we examined U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy&#39;s tweet that &quot;91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted.&quot; We rated Murphy&#39;s statement&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/dec/29/patrick-murphy/terrorist-watch-list-no-obstacle-buying-guns-rep-m/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mostly True</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Murphy, who is running in Florida&#39;s Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in 2016, issued the tweet after Republicans <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1076\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>repeatedly blocked a bill</u></a> that would keep people on the FBI list from buying guns.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murphy was referencing a GAO report from <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2640548/DALLAS-510354-v3-NICS-WATCHLIST-2015-UPDATE-for.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>March 2015</u></a>. But Schumer&#39;s statement focused on the entire year of 2015. So we found the <a href=\"http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=F53C4195-430D-4D8D-ACDE-1EC53E97D0FA&amp;SK=EF4E6FF4158FFA49E570234A3DE8E438\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>updated report</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Issued March 7, 2016, it found &mdash; as Schumer reported &mdash; that only 21 of the 244 transactions attempted by people on the terrorist watch list at a licensed firearms shop were blocked. In 223 cases, the customers got their weapons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are important omissions in these numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we don&#39;t know that 244 people on the list attempted to buy guns. We know that people on the list attempted to buy guns 244 times.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the flip side,&nbsp;the number of people on the watch list who legally purchased weapons may be far higher because the tally doesn&#39;t include transactions made at gun shows, where federal background checks aren&rsquo;t conducted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, there have been questions about the accuracy of the watchlist itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/reports/FBI/a0925/final.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>2009 U.S. Justice Department audit</u></a> showed that 35 percent of the people on the list were &quot;associated with FBI cases that did not contain current international terrorist or domestic terrorism designations&quot; and should have been removed from the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There also are multiple entries for slight variations of the same name, which means people with the same name as a person on the watch list were stopped at airports, a problem that experts say has largely been resolved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schumer said that in 2015, &quot;244 suspected terrorists walked into gun shops and attempted to purchase a firearm; 223 were able to get the firearm&quot; according to the GAO report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He correctly notes that this is gun shop data from the GAO, but he is wrong to suggest that the report is a tally of the number of suspected terrorists trying to make a firearm purchase. As the report makes clear, it&#39;s the number of attempted transactions, some of which might have been done by the same individual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement is accurate but it needs clarification and additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/47d79ce0-3137-4146-834d-1d858403e397\">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/47d79ce0-3137-4146-834d-1d858403e397</a></p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2016-06-15T13:59:25.775097", "ruling_date": "2016-06-15T16:03:48", "ruling_headline": "Schumer: 244 people on terror watch list tried to buy guns in 2015, 91% got them", "ruling_headline_slug": "charles-schumer-terror-watch-list-buy-guns-got-the", "ruling_link_text": "Being a suspected terrorist won't stop you", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Congressional Quarterly transcript, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.cq.com/doc/financialtranscripts-4909162?0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Senate Minority Leader Reid Holds Media Availability After Closed Policy Luncheon</u></a>,&quot; June 14, 2016</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/dec/29/patrick-murphy/terrorist-watch-list-no-obstacle-buying-guns-rep-m/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Terrorist watch list no obstacle to buying guns, U.S. Rep.
