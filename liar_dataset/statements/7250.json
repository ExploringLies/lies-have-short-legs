Is&nbsp;Gaetz&nbsp;correctly characterizing the past?<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFirst, a refresher: The sweeping elections overhaul pushed by Republicans included a number of new restrictions on voter registration, political committees, the date of the presidential preference primary and, yeah, early voting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBefore&nbsp;Gov. Rick Scott signed&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/1355/\">HB&nbsp;1355</a>&nbsp;into law,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2010/101.657\">early voting&nbsp;started</a>&nbsp;15&nbsp;days ahead of an election and ended two days prior. Supervisors were required to provide voters with eight hours of early voting on weekdays sometime between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., as well as a total of eight hours during each of the two weekends. Voting on the Sunday before an election was popular among African-Americans who hosted &quot;souls to the polls&quot; drives.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAll told, supervisors had to provide 96 hours for early voting.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe new law reduced the number of days for early voting from 14 to eight. Republicans said they thought the changes would save money, but Democrats accused them of trying to suppress the vote of liberal and minority voters, who prefer early voting. The new law also meant an end to the &quot;souls to the polls&quot; rallies on the Sunday before the election.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe new law came with new restrictions for voting hours, too. Instead of eight hours of early voting per weekday, the law called for a&nbsp;minimum&nbsp;of six hours a day and a maximum of 12 hours a day.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t* * *<br />\r\n\tNow we&rsquo;ll examine what&nbsp;Gaetz&nbsp;had to do with it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGaetz&nbsp;spokeswoman Katherine&nbsp;Betta&nbsp;directed us to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/1355/Amendment/624028/HTML\">this&nbsp;amendment</a>&nbsp;introduced&nbsp;by&nbsp;Gaetz&nbsp;and the sponsor of the proposed elections overhaul, Sen. Miguel Diaz de la&nbsp;Portilla, R-Miami, on May 5, 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe amendment did three main things:&nbsp;It required&nbsp;local election supervisors to tell the Department of State 30 days in advance the hours and address of each early voting site; it reduced the number of days for early voting, as we have already explained; and it set the daily number of hours for early voting between six and 12 hours. The latter action is key to our fact-check.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGaetz&nbsp;said he introduced the amendment to give more consideration to teachers and military members who populate his former Panhandle district and may have unusual working hours. Voting days of 12 hours would mean voting would be available outside of the traditional 9-to-5 workday.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSenate Republicans said they thought reducing early voting days would save money, but a few elections supervisors warned that 12-hour days might actually lead to higher overtime costs. According to news accounts,&nbsp;Gaetz&nbsp;said Republicans did not want to &quot;dramatically reduce early voting.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt one point during the legislative&nbsp;<a href=\"http://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/1355/Amendment/404618/PDF\">process</a>, the number of early voting days was reduced all the way down to five. Republicans fended off Democratic attempts to restore the number of early voting days back to 14.&nbsp;Gaetz&rsquo;s&nbsp;amendment, which offered eight early voting days, was&nbsp;<a href=\"http://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/1355/Amendment/404618/HTML\">adopted</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;the Senate and included in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/1355\">final version of the&nbsp;bill</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;Scott signed.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t* * *<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tNow we will address the claim that&nbsp;Gaetz&nbsp;offered the amendment as a compromise and threatened to join Democrats against the measure without it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe checked with the Senate&rsquo;s former minority leader, Nan Rich, D-Weston, who said she had not heard about that.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I never recalled him saying he was going to stand with the Democrats,&quot; she said. &quot;All I know is how he voted.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe looked for comments Gaetz may have made on the Senate floor but didn&#39;t find any. In an interview,&nbsp;Gaetz&nbsp;said he did not remember exactly when and where he said he would side with the Democrats without the amendment. He ruled out saying it on the Senate floor or to members of the opposing party, though.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I may have said it in committee, I said it to my staff and I said it to the president,&quot;&nbsp;Gaetz&nbsp;said, referring to his Senate president predecessor, Mike&nbsp;Haridopolos.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSome Republican leaders in the Senate wanted to cut the number of early voting days to eight without expanding hours to make up for lost time, said Diaz de la&nbsp;Portilla&nbsp;in an interview with us. He said he never witnessed&nbsp;Gaetz&nbsp;saying he would cross party lines over the early voting amendment, but &quot;I know there were conversations.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/may/23/kurt-browning/flexibility-early-voting-means-possibly-less-hours/\">PolitiFact&nbsp;Florida has previously&nbsp;disproved</a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;claim that the number of hours are the same. Under the new law, local supervisors may do a&nbsp;maximum of&nbsp;96 hours. But they may also offer fewer than that.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGaetz&nbsp;declined to tell us what kind of changes, if any, he wants to consider in the upcoming legislative session, though he said he could see allowing for more early voting locations. He wants to wait for the findings of a special committee on ethics and elections headed by Sen. Jack&nbsp;Latvala, R-Clearwater, before calling for across-the-board changes for every county, he said.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;My attitude is that as we speak, Sen. (Jack)&nbsp;Latvala&nbsp;is conducting a hearing with election supervisors to try to find out what were the reasons that there were difficulties in some places,&quot;&nbsp;Gaetz&nbsp;told&nbsp;PolitiFact&nbsp;Florida.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBack to our mission:&nbsp;Gaetz&rsquo;s&nbsp;editorial board comments that he sponsored the amendment that expanded hours for early voting and threatened to join Democrats in opposition if leaders did not agree to it.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe cannot prove or disprove his claim that he threatened to side with Democrats. For this reason, we&rsquo;re not rating this part of his statement.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGaetz did introduced the amendment that permitted more hours for early voting. But his amendment empowered supervisors to provide<em> up to </em>12 hours of early voting a day. It was not an automatic expansion, and supervisors could actually choose to offer less time than the old law.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe rate his claim Half True.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2013-01-14T19:01:01.732050", "ruling_date": "2013-01-15T14:00:13", "ruling_headline": "Don Gaetz says he backed proposal to expand early voting hours per day", "ruling_headline_slug": "don-gaetz-says-he-backed-proposal-expand-early-vot", "ruling_link_text": "A trip down Amendment Avenue", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\t<em>Palm Beach Post, &quot;</em><a href=\"http://www.postonpolitics.com/2011/05/elections-rewrite-taking-shape-in-senate/\">Elections law rewrite closer to completion</a>,&quot; May 5, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Tampa Bay Times</em>, &quot;GOP protects its voting bill,&quot; May 5, 2012<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<em>Tampa Bay Times</em>&rsquo; The Buzz blog, &quot;Partisan heat in Senate over election overhaul bill,&quot; May 4, 2011<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFlorida Senate, <a href=\"http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/1355\">HB 1355 </a>and <a href=\"http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/2086\">SB 2086</a><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with Senate President Don Gaetz, Jan. 14, 2013<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tInterview with former Sen.
