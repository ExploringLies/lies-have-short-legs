She said Hutchison &lsquo;has vacillated between a pro-choice and an anti-choice position for the last three years, after having been solidly anti-choice for 20 years.&rsquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Hutchison has said she favors abortion rights but would allow states to impose some restrictions, such as requiring minors to get parental consent.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNational news outlets picked up on the irony of a feminist saying that a female politician&rsquo;s views disqualified her from being a real woman. <em>Time</em> magazine used the quotation to start its <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978687,00.html\">June 14, 1993, story</a> on Hutchison&rsquo;s win:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Gloria Steinem flew to Texas all the way from New York City to call Senate candidate Kay Bailey Hutchison a &lsquo;female impersonator.&rsquo; Actress Annie Potts of &lsquo;Designing Women&rsquo; pooh-poohed the Republican&#39;s vague stance on abortion rights, saying, &lsquo;She&#39;s just the same old thing in a skirt.&rsquo; Columnist Molly Ivins hung the epithet &lsquo;Breck girl&rsquo; on her, comparing the way the candidate tossed her blond hair to the slow-motion antics of models in the shampoo commercial. But Hutchison, the Texas state treasurer, survived those and many other attacks.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor decades, Steinem has used the term &quot;female impersonator&quot; to describe women, including herself, who she said stopped being authentically female as they fit themselves into patriarchal society.
