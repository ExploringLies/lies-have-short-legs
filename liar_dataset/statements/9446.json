Ingraham sought to reframe the issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Americans won the war with our allies in World War II,&quot; Ingraham said. &quot;Americans developed some of the most groundbreaking pieces of technology that the world has ever seen. We invented the automobile. We invented the airplane. Americans can do those jobs.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that the Wright brothers invented the airplane, and Henry Ford was a major player in making the car a global commercial success. But a listener to Ingraham&#39;s show was pretty sure that she was off the mark when she said Americans invented the automobile. The listener asked us to look into it, so we did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we contacted<strong> </strong>University of Dayton automobile historian John Heitmann, he said the car&rsquo;s roots are in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The automobile is European by birth, American by adoption,&quot; Heitmann said. &quot;German inventors and French entrepreneurs led the way.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first patent for an internal combustion powered car -- a two-seater -- was filed on Jan. 29, 1886 by <a href=\"http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-1322446-1-1323352-1-0-0-1322455-0-0-135-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html\"><u>Karl Benz in Germany</u></a>. &nbsp;Benz&rsquo;s names lives on in the Mercedes-Benz brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also checked with<strong> </strong>John Lienhard, a professor of technology at the University of Houston. In a <a href=\"http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1596.htm\"><u>radio series on innovation</u></a>, Lienhard said a few people actually built powered vehicles before Benz. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.asme.org/about-asme/who-we-are/engineering-history/landmarks/203-siegfried-marcus-car\"><u>Austrian engineer Sigfried Marcus</u></a> invented the carburator for his first gas-powered car in 1864. Marcus built a second prototype sometime between 1875 and 1888. The car is owned today by the Austrian Automobile, Motorcycle and Touring Club in Vienna. Reportedly, it still runs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(A side note: When Nazi Germany annexed Austria, the Nazis tried to expunge all records of Marcus because he was Jewish. <a href=\"http://archive.today/yXkhr\"><u>His car was hidden behind a false brick wall</u></a> and &quot;re-discovered&quot; in 1949. Like a scene out of the Woody Allen movie <a href=\"http://youtu.be/Ctin21yrfcA\"><u>Sleeper</u></a>, it started up and was driven at the break-neck speed of about <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=nYSdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=Siegfried+Marcus+hidden+car&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZPOwc3b2pB&amp;sig=a53u_bQokpYPsS7NNg_NS_iS8QY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EhqaU6fqC4zfsASH3YKIBA&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=Siegfried%20Marcus%20hidden%20car&amp;f=false\"><u>3 mph</u></a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steam-powered cars date back even earlier -- to 1769 in France. Lienhard told PunditFact he shudders at having to figure out the question of who was &quot;first,&quot; since the path to what we know today as the car included many zig-zags, incremental improvements and dead ends. He wrote a book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/How-Invention-Begins-Echoes-Machines/dp/0195341201/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1215725193&amp;sr=1-1\"><u>How Invention Begins</u></a>, about the many efforts that ultimately produced the car we know today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, he offered a rule of thumb: Look at who had the first commercial success. By that standard, the nod goes to Benz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;He built a little three-wheeled car in 1885 and sold his first one two years later,&quot; Lienhard wrote. &quot;He went into production with a four-wheeled model in 1890.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should note that America was not too far behind Benz. According to the <a href=\"http://bentley.umich.edu/research/guides/automotive/\"><u>University of Michigan&rsquo;s Bentley Historical Library</u></a>, William Morrison constructed an electric carriage that he drove through Des Moines, Iowa, in 1891. In 1893, Frank Duryea exhibited a motorized truck, using an internal combustion engine. The first sales to the American public took place in 1896.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Once we got into the game, we moved very fast,&quot; Lienhard said. &quot;Our role in the development of the automobile was huge.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ingraham show producer Julia Hahn told us Ingraham was thinking of Americans&rsquo; early work in engine design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ingraham said that Americans invented the automobile. If we look at internal combustion-powered vehicles, all of the first examples come from Europe, and the first commercial enterprise emerged in Germany. America played a major role in automobile production, but Ingraham spoke specifically about an earlier stage -- invention. We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-06-13T11:27:11.358367", "ruling_date": "2014-06-13T11:42:34", "ruling_headline": "Did Americans invent the car?
