Walker said the Republican-led state Legislature allocated about $47 million a year between 2006 and 2008 for unemployment benefits. In 2009, the total rose to $60 million. Earlier this year, the Legislature approved $56 million. Walker also noted that Thurmond is a Democrat.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;Where&#39;s the mismanagement?&quot; Walker asked in his blog.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe state Labor Department said the Legislature does not allocate funding for unemployment benefits. Those funds, the department said, come from taxes paid by Georgia employers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo sort this all out, let&#39;s begin by looking at how the Georgia unemployment program works.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBusinesses in Georgia pay into a state fund that the Labor Department uses to pay unemployment when workers are laid off or terminated through no fault of their own. In 1998, Georgia had $1.9 billion in the fund, said Brock Timmons, chief of the Labor Department&#39;s employment insurance legal section. In 2003 and 2004, the state paid out about $722 million a year from the fund, Timmons said. In 2009, at the height of the Great Recession, Georgia paid $1.47 billion in unemployment benefits. Georgia&#39;s unemployment rate has been above the national average in recent years. It is currently at 9.9 percent; the national average is 9.6 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;It took us by surprise,&quot; Timmons said of the rising unemployment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome employers, as a result of the tax cuts that took effect between 2000 and 2003, paid little or no money to the unemployment fund.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe percentage Georgia employers paid in the fund increased by 15 percent in 2009 and by 13 percent in 2010.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tState officials say Georgia has received advances totaling $454.5 million from the federal government. Georgia must pay back the money but has not set up a timetable to do so. Timmons said Georgia employers could pay more in federal unemployment taxes if the loan isn&#39;t repaid by November 2011.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia Democratic Party spokesman Eric Gray told us the Facebook message could have been more precise. He posted a column on Georgia Politico explaining the party&#39;s point. The column says state GOP leaders did not make the &quot;tough choices&quot; necessary to avert this problem when the recession hit. The column does not say what the &quot;tough choices&quot; were.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;With the unemployment fund nearly broke, they reluctantly accepted stimulus money from the federal government to replenish the unemployment fund. This bought them time to address the problem,&quot; the column says. &quot;Yet Republicans stuck with what they are good at -- ignoring it even more.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe column does not specify what state leaders should have done to avoid the current problem of borrowing money from the federal government.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe funds are still managed by the state Labor Department, which is run by a Democrat, not a Republican. Democratic Party officials say they should have been more precise in their description of the problem on Facebook. We agree. We rate it as False.</p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2010-11-29T16:24:35.943508", "ruling_date": "2010-11-30T06:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Democrats: State Republicans to blame for unemployment benefit gap", "ruling_headline_slug": "state-republicans-blame-unemployment-benefit-gap", "ruling_link_text": "Finger in unemployment blame game pointed in wrong direction", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tDemocratic Party of Georgia <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/pages/Democratic-Party-of-Georgia/105791402802932\">Facebook</a> page<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia Politico, &quot;<a href=\"http://gapolitico.com/?p=16260\">Guest: Republican Mismanagement of Unemployment</a>,&quot; Nov. 20, 2010<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tGeorgia Unfiltered, &quot;<a href=\"http://georgiaunfiltered.blogspot.com/\">True or False?
