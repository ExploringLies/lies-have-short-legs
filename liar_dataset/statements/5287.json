Chris Christie&rsquo;s proposal to reduce state income taxes, state Sen. Joe Pennacchio reminded his fellow legislators of how taxpayers in Pennsylvania and Delaware are already getting better deals.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPennsylvania charges a top income tax rate of 3 percent, while Delaware doesn&rsquo;t collect any state income taxes, according to Pennacchio.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;We&rsquo;re competing worldwide, but especially we&rsquo;re competing with our regional states. This has to make us more competitive, because when you take a look at us versus Pennsylvania, it&#39;s still three percent in Pennsylvania,&quot; Pennacchio (R-Morris) said during a Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee hearing. &quot;When you take a look at us versus Delaware, it&#39;s still zero in Delaware.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIn a news release issued following the meeting, Pennacchio repeated the claim: &quot;A small decrease is a good first step to making New Jersey more competitive with states like Pennsylvania which charges a top rate of 3%, or Delaware which has no state income tax at all.&quot;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tEach time, Pennacchio was right about Pennsylvania, but wrong about Delaware. As PolitiFact New Jersey found, both states charge state income taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPennacchio acknowledged in a phone interview that he was wrong about Delaware, but argued that New Jersey still needs to be competitive with its neighboring states.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t&quot;I think the premise is still the same,&quot; Pennacchio told us.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tHere&rsquo;s the story with state income taxes in Pennsylvania and Delaware:<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tPennsylvania charges a flat income tax rate of 3.07 percent on all taxpayers, regardless of income level. Certain individuals or families may qualify for a state program that eliminates or reduces their state income taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tSo, Pennacchio is correct about the 3 percent rate in the Keystone State.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tBut Delaware also charges a state income tax. In 2011, that state&rsquo;s rates ranged from 2.2 percent on taxable income greater than $2,000 to a top rate of 6.95 percent on taxable income greater than $60,000. This year, Delaware&rsquo;s top rate is decreasing to 6.75 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t(For shoppers looking to save some money, Delaware doesn&rsquo;t have a sales tax.)<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese seven states don&rsquo;t collect any state income taxes: Alaska, Florida, South Dakota, Washington, Nevada, Texas and Wyoming. New Hampshire and Tennessee impose taxes on interest and dividends income, but not one&rsquo;s wages.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIt&rsquo;s worth noting that the top income tax rates in Pennsylvania and Delaware still remain below the maximum rate in New Jersey, where individuals with taxable income exceeding $500,000 face a rate of 8.97 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<strong>Our ruling</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tAt a Senate committee hearing and then in a news release afterwards, Pennacchio claimed that Pennsylvania imposes an income tax rate of 3 percent and Delaware doesn&rsquo;t collect any state income taxes.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe senator&rsquo;s on target when it comes to Pennsylvania, where taxpayers face a flat rate of 3.07 percent. But he&rsquo;s wrong about Delaware, since that state imposes income tax rates ranging from 2.2 percent to more than 6 percent.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tWe rate the statement Half True.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo comment on this ruling, go to <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/politifact_nj_republican_senat.html\">NJ.com</a>.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2012-02-01T17:15:19.012768", "ruling_date": "2012-02-02T07:30:00", "ruling_headline": "Republican senator claims Pennsylvania charges top income tax rate of 3 percent and Delaware has no state income tax", "ruling_headline_slug": "republican-senator-claims-pennsylvania-charges-top", "ruling_link_text": "Livin' ain't that easy in Delaware", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>\r\n\tSen.
