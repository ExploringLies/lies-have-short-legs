And on July 15, 2016, a claim made by another Democratic lawmaker caught our attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State Rep. <a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2015/legislators/assembly/1324\">Dana Wachs</a> of Eau Claire, a lawyer and four-year lawmaker who has been mentioned as a possible 2018 gubernatorial candidate, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanaJWachs/status/754088342623444992\">said in a tweet</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Walker holding listening sessions: Good. Making them invite-only &amp; excluding the press: Not so good.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is he right that the listening sessions are invitation only and exclude the media?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wachs&rsquo; evidence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wachs&rsquo; tweet included a link to a <em>Capital Times</em> <a href=\"http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/election-matters/as-scott-walker-reaches-listening-sessions-critics-continue-to-question/article_5b38578f-5461-518d-9386-cd6dfd7f78bc.html\">news article</a> that was posted the same day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article said that, according to state records, Walker&#39;s office had asked lawmakers, lobbyists, state agency heads and local economic development agencies to help select attendees for his invite-only listening sessions throughout the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article said Walker had held 50 such sessions, all of which were open only to invited guests. The general public and the press were excluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This wasn&#39;t disputed. The governor&rsquo;s office issued <a href=\"http://walker.wi.gov/newsroom/press-release/governor-walker-provides-update-2020-vision-project-listening-sessions\">a statement</a> in connection with the 50th session that quoted Walker as saying:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Before every listening session, we&rsquo;re in contact with area state legislators, no matter what party they represent, as well as community leaders to help us reach out and invite a good cross-section of people with different experiences and opinions. We also focus on ensuring those from a particular community are the primary attendees.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement continued:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Advance notice of participation is intended to ensure that there are no threatening criminal backgrounds and to avoid people whose intent is to be disruptive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile listening sessions are closed to members of the press to encourage an honest and candid conversation between attendees, local members of the media are given the opportunity to sit down for one-on-one interviews following the listening session in the interest of transparency.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few weeks earlier, residents in Pierce County held signs outside one of Walker&rsquo;s listening sessions <a href=\"http://www.piercecountyherald.com/news/government/4060896-dozens-protest-governor-walkers-invitation-only-listening-session-pepin\">to protest</a> not being allowed in. But such protests have not been common.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker had <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-trying-to-reconnect-with-voters-in-listening-sessions-b99656723z1-366354231.html\">touted the tour</a> six months earlier in his &quot;State of the State&quot; address. The M<em>ilwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> noted criticism from Democrats, including <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/russ-feingold/\">Russ Feingold</a>, who is running against Republican U.S. Sen. <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ron-johnson/\">Ron Johnson</a> for the seat he lost to Johnson in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a senator, Feingold&rsquo;s listening sessions were open to the public, and that wasn&#39;t always pleasant during the emotional debates over President Barack Obama&#39;s health-care law in 2010, the <em>Journal Sentinel</em> noted. If the meetings aren&rsquo;t open to the public, Feingold told the newspaper, &quot;you&#39;re going to have a pre-selection process and you&#39;re not going to get the full picture.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said the governor speaks to local media after each session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wachs says Walker&#39;s &quot;listening sessions&quot; are &quot;invite-only and excluding the press.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he travels Wisconsin to meet with residents, Walker asks various people, including Democratic lawmakers, for suggestions on who to invite to his listening sessions.
