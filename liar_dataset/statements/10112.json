Scott Walker put a happy face on the state&rsquo;s long-term budget outlook in his second debate with Democratic challenger Mary Burke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The most recent fiscal year just ended with a cash balance of some $517 million,&quot; Walker said. &quot;And the next state budget will begin with a surplus of over half a billion dollars -- $535 million to be exact. That means we can invest in our priorities.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That first figure is undisputed and <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/state-ends-fiscal-year-with-517-million-on-hand-b99371881z1-279331672.html\">widely reported</a>: The state ended the year from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014 in the black by $517 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Burke challenged Walker&rsquo;s second figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a $1.8 billion shortfall heading into the 2015-&rsquo;17 budget, she said, not a &quot;surplus of over half a billion dollars.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a huge difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To determine if Walker is right about the projected $535 million surplus, we turned to reports issued by the state&rsquo;s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first, we want to be crystal clear about what is being debated here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not a prediction of how the second year of the 2013-&rsquo;15 budget will end up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather, Walker is talking about projections on where the state&rsquo;s finances will be as the next governor and Legislature put the 2015-&rsquo;17 budget together in early 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is what is often referred to as the &quot;structural deficit.&quot; The name is unfortunate. The figure does not reflect a &quot;deficit&quot; or -- if Walker is right -- a &quot;surplus&quot; at the end of a budget year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather, it is a tally of past decisions -- both in spending and in tax collections -- that officials will have to account for in the next two-year budget. As such, it&rsquo;s a benchmark for the size of the budget challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fiscal Bureau does this exercise periodically, mostly during budget season. The bureau&rsquo;s longstanding method is to assume no loss or gain in revenue and no changes in spending. Applying the same approach allows for a consistent picture over time. The bureau&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://static.maciverinstitute.com/LFB%20Report%201517%20struc%20deficit.pdf\">latest estimate</a> came out Sept. 8, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bottom line: a $1.76 billion deficit heading into the 2015-&rsquo;17 budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the chief reasons for the gap: Tax cuts approved by Walker and the Republican-led Legislature, which contributed to a slowing of revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The numbers cited by Walker</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what is Walker referring to with his $535 million surplus figure?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That figure is contained in a Sept. 18, 2014 Fiscal Bureau memo to a Republican state representative, John Nygren of Marinette.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the wake of the $1.8 billion estimate, Nygren asked the bureau to look at it a different way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He asked for an estimate of the budget challenge assuming that lawmakers would hold most spending at 2014-&rsquo;15 levels for the two following years, and tax revenue would rise at the five-year average of 2.9 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That yielded an estimate of a $535 million surplus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fiscal Bureau also got a request from a Democrat, state Sen. Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse. It asked the Fiscal Bureau to run an estimate based on increases in school spending, granting state agencies their $1 billion spending requests and other changes. Budget requests came in Sept. 15, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That <a href=\"http://www.thewheelerreport.com/wheeler_docs/files/0925shillinglfbmemo.pdf\">estimate </a>was a $2.7 billion shortfall. &nbsp;Another scenario run for Shilling was a deficit of $4 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You get the idea. Just weeks from the Nov. 4, 2014 election, both parties have come up with ways to manipulate the Fiscal Bureau&rsquo;s $1.8 billion estimate using some scenarios that range from spending freezes to giving agencies everything on their wish lists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re not buying it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&rsquo;s own budgets report the &quot;structural deficit&quot; number using the method the Fiscal Bureau used to come up with $1.8 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And lawmakers of both parties have done the same for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, Walker has used the &quot;structural deficit&quot; estimates to his advantage in the past and even has made it the centerpiece of his re-election campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every time you hear the governor say he inherited a $3.6 billion &quot;deficit&quot; from Gov. Jim Doyle, it&rsquo;s a reflection in part of the $2.5 billion &quot;structural deficit&quot; the Fiscal Bureau estimated in 2011 as Walker prepared his first budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Walker, again using the Fiscal Bureau&rsquo;s traditional methodology, has touted the fact that his tight budgeting actually eliminated -- however temporarily -- the structural deficit heading into his second budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker&rsquo;s campaign argues that the Fiscal Bureau memo is based on some outdated figures and that it&rsquo;s zero-growth assumption is unrealistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the governor is seeking to have it both ways, trumpeting the bureau&rsquo;s method when it suits him and rejecting it when it does not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numbers will change again when the Fiscal Bureau updates its report in early 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our rating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker told debate viewers: &quot;The next state budget will begin with a surplus of over half a billion dollars -- $535 million to be exact.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That rosy number flies in the face of the official estimate that uses a long-established method used by members of both parties, and the governor&rsquo;s budget office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate the claim False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2014-10-21T15:51:53.314624", "ruling_date": "2014-10-22T05:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Scott Walker says next state budget will begin with $535 million surplus", "ruling_headline_slug": "scott-walker-says-next-state-budget-will-begin-535", "ruling_link_text": "As of now, a \"structural deficit\" is projected", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CSPAN <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?322065-1/wisconsin-governors-debate\">video</a> of second Walker-Burke debate, Oct. 17, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Bob Lang, director, Legislative Fiscal Bureau, Oct. 20, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email exchange with Alleigh Marre, Walker campaign spokeswoman, Oct. 20, 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legislative Fiscal Bureau,<a href=\"http://static.maciverinstitute.com/LFB%20Report%201517%20struc%20deficit.pdf\"> memo</a> to Sen.
