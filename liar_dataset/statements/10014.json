Elorza blamed one of his opponents, Vincent A. &quot;Buddy&quot; Cianci Jr., an independent, for signing a consent decree when he was mayor that provided for 5- and 6-percent cost of living allowances for retirees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now we have a retiree that is collecting a $17,000 paycheck a month . . . tax free,&quot; Elorza said. &quot;How many families in Providence don&#39;t make $17,000 a year.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You can thank the court for that,&quot; Cianci retorted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were curious about whether that $17,000 monthly paycheck -- equivalent to $204,000 in annual tax-free income -- is real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Providence officials sent us the 2014 list of the <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/241798874/Top-Providence-RI-retiree-salaries-in-2014\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>49 people receiving the largest pension payments</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirty seven retirees are receiving checks totaling over $100,000 per year, or at least $8,333 each month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All but eight were firefighters. The rest were police officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least 28 of those 37 are tax-free disability pensions. Four others may be disability pensions but it&#39;s not clear from the list because the money is going to a surviving spouse. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the top of the list: Gilbert McLaughlin of Warwick, who retired in October 1991 with an accidental disability pension. He served as chief for 15 months before retiring, citing health problems stemming from a job-related injury to his neck and shoulders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His annual payment from the city as of May 2014: $196,813.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s $16,401 per month, or $599 shy of the $17,000 cited by Elorza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McLaughlin retired as the city&#39;s fire chief at the age of 55. At retirement, his base salary was $63,537 per year plus $6,959 in longevity pay for his 36 years, six months and eleven days of service. Total: $70,496.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He received 83.7 percent of that as his pension, or $59,001 a year, according to Lawrence J. Mancini, the city&#39;s acting director of administration and finance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His payment grew so large because he received an annual 5-percent compounding cost of living adjustment that was increased to 6 percent in 1996, Mancini said. (Cianci&#39;s second stint as Providence mayor ran from 1991 through most of 2002.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this was part of <a href=\"http://www.providencejournal.com/business/pensions/content/20110607-retirement-board-once-dominated-by-unions-compounded-providence-pension-woes.ece\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>a long-running legal war</u></a> over pensions in the city. The stage was set around 1977, near the beginning of Cianci&#39;s first stint as mayor, when the General Assembly gave the city&#39;s unions a controlling number of seats on the city&#39;s Retirement Board. A 1983 City Charter change, when Cianci was still in office, gave the board extra power to make pension decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1989, with Joseph Paolino as mayor, the board granted compounded cost-of-living adjustments of 5 and 6 percent for all present and future public safety retirees and 3 percent for non-uniformed workers. In 1991, in the midst of a court battle over pensions, Cianci was back in office and he signed a consent decree that locked in some of the benefits, a decree that he would come to regret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, in <a href=\"http://www.providenceri.com/saving-providence\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>an agreement</u></a> Mayor Angel Taveras negotiated with the police and fire unions, the city ended the big compounded cost of living adjustments, so his annual pension remains frozen at $196,813.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To put this in context, the salary of the current fire chief, Clarence Cunha, is $164,736 a year, including longevity pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If McLaughlin&#39;s initial pension had <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>risen with inflation</u></a>, and not at 5 or 6 percent, it would be worth $103,036 today, or just under $8,586 a month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jorge Elorza said, &quot;We have a retiree that is collecting a $17,000 paycheck a month . . . tax free.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city&#39;s biggest retirement check goes to a retired fire chief who is getting $16,401.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Elorza overstated the amount a bit, its close enough to rate his statement <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/about/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>True</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(If you have a claim you&rsquo;d like <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/feb/21/principles-truth-o-meter/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>PolitiFact Rhode Island</u></a> to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.
