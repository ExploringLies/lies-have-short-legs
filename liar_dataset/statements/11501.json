At the time, March 2012, the claim had some numerical validity but was also cherry-picked and flawed. We rated it <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/10/mitt-romney/romney-campaign-says-women-were-hit-hard-job-losse/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Mostly False</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to the Fiorina campaign and did not hear back, so we&rsquo;re not sure if she based her statement on the same data as Romney&rsquo;s campaign used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But here&rsquo;s what we found back <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/10/mitt-romney/romney-campaign-says-women-were-hit-hard-job-losse/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>in April 2012</u></a>: Between January 2009 and March 2012, the total drop in employment was, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 740,000. In the same period, employment for women fell by 683,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do the division and you get 92.3 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A big problem with the claim in 2012 was that it cherry-picked the starting date for assessing Obama&rsquo;s jobs track record. The recession began in December 2007, and he didn&rsquo;t take office until January 2009, when it was nearly over. It&rsquo;s difficult to blame any president for the economic situation he inherited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bigger problem with Fiorina making the same statement today is that Obama&rsquo;s first term continued for another 10 months. &nbsp;During that time, the women job numbers did a U-turn and became a net gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cesbtab5.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>government data</u></a> show an increase of 416,000 working women between January 2009 and January 2013. Total employment also rose by 1.3 million. So more women actually were working at the end of Obama&rsquo;s first term compared with the day he first took office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We used the January 2009 to January 2013 timeframe to be consistent with the original Republican framing of the critique of Obama&rsquo;s economic policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiorina said 92 percent of the jobs lost during Obama&rsquo;s first term belonged to women. By January 2013, the jobs numbers don&rsquo;t back it up at all. The number of women with jobs increased by 416,000 during Obama&rsquo;s first term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate this claim False.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><script src=\"http://www.politifact.com/media/js/politifactwidget5.js\"></script></p>", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-10-29T11:41:29.159095", "ruling_date": "2015-10-29T11:55:19", "ruling_headline": "Fiorina levies out-of-date charge on women job losses under Obama", "ruling_headline_slug": "fiorina-levies-out-date-charge-women-job-losses-un", "ruling_link_text": "The correct numbers show women gained jobs", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>CNBC, Third Republican presidential debate, Oct. 28, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bureau of Labor Statistics,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cesbtab5.htm\">Employment, Hours, and Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huffington Post, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/11/romney-politifact-correction-women-job-loss_n_1418334.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Romney Campaign Demands Correction From PolitiFact On Women&#39;s Job Loss Claim</u></a>, April 11, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PolitiFact, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/10/mitt-romney/romney-campaign-says-women-were-hit-hard-job-losse/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Romney campaign says women were hit hard by job losses under Obama</u></a>, April 10, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Washington Post</em>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/are-obamas-job-policies-hurting-women/2012/04/09/gIQAGz3q6S_blog.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Are Obama&rsquo;s job policies hurting women?</u></a>,April 10, 2012</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 5, "current_job": "", "false_count": 5, "first_name": "Carly", "half_true_count": 4, "home_state": "California", "id": 428, "last_name": "Fiorina", "mostly_true_count": 3, "name_slug": "carly-fiorina", "pants_count": 2, "party": {"id": 3, "party": "Republican", "party_slug": "republican", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/3/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/Fiorina_1.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "National", "edition": "National", "edition_slug": "truth-o-meter", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 1, "index_page": true, "meter_name": "The Truth-O-Meter<sup>TM</sup>", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/1/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/428/", "total_count": 23, "true_count": 3, "website": "http://carlyforca.com/"}, "statement": "<p>&quot;92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama&rsquo;s first term belonged to women.&quot;</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "the third Republican presidential debate", "statement_date": "2015-10-28", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 175, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/175/", "subject": "Jobs", "subject_slug": "jobs", "used_in_edition": ["/api/v/2/edition/8/"]}, {"description": "", "id": 146, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/146/", "subject": "Women", "subject_slug": "women", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
