They fund her campaigns.&quot; </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">The 30-second spot attacks Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte&#39;s record on gun control measures as she faces a tough re-election bid against New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat. </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">Sponsored by the political action committee for Americans for Responsible Solutions, the ad&rsquo;s ominous tone and imagery leave the viewer with the impression that Ayotte doesn&rsquo;t care what her constituents want because she&rsquo;s in the pocket of well-heeled firearms lobbyists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">It&rsquo;s a line of attack used in the wake of the Orlando shootings and the Senate&rsquo;s votes on gun control legislation. It has also employed by New Hampshire Democrats. &quot;Ayotte puts her gun lobby backers before the safety and security of New Hampshire,&quot; Ray Buckley, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said in a June 21 statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">PolitiFact New Hampshire wondered how much the &quot;gun lobby&quot; is really spending on Ayotte&rsquo;s campaign. We&rsquo;ve recently <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2016/jun/21/maggie-hassan/challenger-maggie-hassan-says-kelly-ayotte-voted-a/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>looked into Ayotte&rsquo;s voting history</u></a> on expanded background checks. Now, we&rsquo;ll focus on the financial supporters of her campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\"><strong>Following the money</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">A review of campaign finance records shows that Ayotte has accepted at least $7,450 in donations from the most prominent lobbying group, the National Rifle Association, over her career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">Over the course of Ayotte&rsquo;s career, according to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pkNI3qiMGf7BKD-vnNm1CztcAbIrXDKK15UxG3GxDNM/edit?ts=575f2c14#gid=549714618\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>the database</u></a>, gun rights groups have given her campaign or leadership PAC a total of $68,595. This total includes donations from the NRA as well as other groups such as the National Shooting Sports Foundation. It also includes donations from individuals who have a pattern of making political contributions supporting gun rights,&nbsp;which most people wouldn&rsquo;t associate with the &quot;Washington gun lobby.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">Americans for Responsible Solutions communications director Mark Prentice said the data in the OpenSecrets database makes it &quot;absolutely clear&quot; that gun rights groups fund her campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">Beyond direct campaign contributions to Ayotte, those groups have spent another $12,500 in independent expenditures to support her, bringing the sum to more than $80,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">But it&rsquo;s important to keep those numbers in context. </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">The average U.S. Senate campaign costs <a href=\"http://maplight.org/content/73190\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>more than $10 million</u></a>, according to a study by MapLight.org, a nonpartisan group that studies money in politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">As she prepared for a contentious reelection battle, Ayotte reported having <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00030980&amp;cycle=2016\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>$6.9 million cash on hand</u></a> in the last fundraising report March 31.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">In other words, the money she&rsquo;s received -- directly or indirectly -- from gun lobbyists during her political career represents about 1 percent of the cash she has on hand right now. When compared against the $12.4 million she&rsquo;s raised since she first became a candidate in the 2010 cycle, it&rsquo;s 0.65 percent of her lifetime fundraising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">And Ayotte&rsquo;s $7,450 from the NRA pale in comparison to what the group gave to its top recipient in Congress, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. McCain has received $37,150 in direct support and more than $7 million in independent expenditures for him and against his opponents, according to OpenSecrets records dating back to 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">&quot;The ad is misleading because the contributions cited equal only about half a percent of the total amount raised by our campaign over her career,&quot; Ayotte&rsquo;s campaign spokeswoman Liz Johnson said in an email statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">Meanwhile, the group that&rsquo;s running the ad, Americans for Responsible Solutions, was founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords, an Arizona Democrat and mass-shooting survivor. It has spent $834,278 in independent expenditures against Ayotte&rsquo;s candidacy, <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/indexpend.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00540443\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>according to OpenSecrets</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">That&rsquo;s about 10 times the amount of money spent on Ayotte&rsquo;s campaign by pro-gun groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\"><strong>Ayotte&rsquo;s gun-policy views</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">The ad also claims Ayotte &quot;stands with the Washington gun lobby&quot; in return for the donations she&rsquo;s received, but that hasn&rsquo;t universally been the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">Ayotte <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/12/19/us/politics/nra.html?_r=0\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>received an &quot;A&quot; rating</u></a> from the NRA in 2012, meaning she was viewed as a &quot;solidly pro-gun&quot; candidate. </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">The NRA and associated groups have taken out ads supporting Ayotte in the past. &quot;Thank you for protecting the rights of gun owners, hunters and all who cherish the freedoms of our Second Amendment,&quot; one ad from from the National Shooting Sports Foundation said. Another ad came from an organization called the The New Hampshire Men and Women of the National Rifle Association. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">However, her voting record has not always adhered to the NRA&rsquo;s stances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">On June 20, for instance, Ayotte backed two bills blocking gun sales to suspected terrorists -- a switch from when she voted to kill a similar Democratic plan in December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">A day later, she <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/284378-senate-gop-may-defy-nra-on-gun-bill\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>co-sponsored a bipartisan gun control bill</u></a> with U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to strengthen existing background check laws, which the NRA opposed. Collins, one of the Senate&rsquo;s most moderate Republicans, has a C+ rating from the NRA. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\"><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">The gun control group Americans for Responsible Solutions said Ayotte &quot;stands with the Washington gun lobby. They fund her campaigns.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">Ayotte has indeed benefited from money from gun rights groups &ndash; $81,095 over her career, to be exact. But it&rsquo;s worth adding some context -- that&rsquo;s about one-half of one percent of the total money she&rsquo;s raised, and a modest amount compared to other Senate Republicans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">Meanwhile, it&rsquo;s not entirely correct to say that Ayotte always &quot;stands with the Washington gun lobby.&quot; She has voted for legislation favored by the NRA, but has also bucked the NRA on at least one occasion. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-right:4.5pt\">The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: This article has been clarified to reflect the existence of some ads that were supportive of Ayotte from pro-gun groups and to reflect that some campaign contributions came from individuals, not organizations.
