Bob McDonnell. It was projected to raise $3.4 billion for state transportation during the next five years through a series of tax increases and budgeting steps. Lawmakers replaced a 17.5-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax -- which had not changed since 1987 -- with a 3.5 percent wholesale levy on gas that would keep pace with inflation. They also increased taxes on motor vehicle sales and for obtaining a driver&rsquo;s licenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the key to McMurtrie&rsquo;s claim lies in changes that were made to the state&rsquo;s general sales tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1987, the levy had been 5 cents on the dollar. Of that nickel, 3.5 cents went to the state&rsquo;s general fund, which pays for education, public safety and health programs. One penny went to local governments and a half-cent was earmarked for transportation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The legislation raised the sales tax to 5.3 percent and gave all of the increase to transportation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the bill provisionally took a small share of the existing sales tax revenues that went to the general fund and redirected it to highway maintenance. At most, 0.175 cents on the dollar would be diverted to transportation, phased in over five years. That switch, when completed in 2018, would generate $198 million a year for transportation. The general fund&rsquo;s share of the sales tax would fall from 3.5 cents on a dollar to 3.325 cents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Post, in its article, accurately wrote that the bill devoted &quot;a fatter slice of existing revenues to transportation instead of schools, public safety and other services.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>McMurtrie, however, takes liberty with the Post article. He assumes that all of the general funds being moved to transportation will be stripped from education when, in fact, public schools traditionally receive about one-third of the fund. Then he takes the full $198 million general transfer in 2018 and multiplies it by 10 to reach a conclusion that, over a decade, the loss of education money will total $2 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s another fundamental problem. The Post article, on which McMutrie bases his claims, is more than two years old. The provisions of the sales tax transfer have changed, making all of McMurtrie&rsquo;s numbers outdated and even more inflated. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2013 bill assumed that Congress would pass legislation to help states collect taxes on goods bought through the Internet. Virginia&rsquo;s new proceeds -- about $180 million a year -- would be earmarked for transportation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress demurred, however, and a backup plan in the state transportation bill went into effect at the start of this year that reduced the potential loss for public schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Plan B, only 0.1 cent of the sales tax that once went to the general fund is being shifted to transportation -- now and in the future. That comes to about $113 million a year, according to the <a href=\"http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?131+oth+HB2313FCHP122+PDF\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Department of Planning and Budget</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s the likely impact on education? Let&rsquo;s do the math:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public schools, as we noted, receive about one-third of general fund revenues. Assuming that trend holds up, about $38 million a year that would have gone to schools will be sent to transportation. Over 10 years, as McMurtrie likes to calculate, it would come to $380 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For perspective, schools are slated to receive nearly $6.5 billion in state funding during the budget year that will start on July 1. A $38 million transfer would come 0.6 percent of the funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s one last point to address: McMurtrie&rsquo;s contention that lawmakers and lobbyists &quot;quietly shifted&quot; the money &nbsp;from education. The General Assembly publicly debated the transportation bill. Newspapers, including the Richmond Times-Dispatch, reported extensively on it in 2013, often on the front page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>McMurtrie says legislators &quot;quietly shifted $2 billion from education to road building&quot; in 2013. He backs his statement with hyper-inflated numbers multiplied over a 10-year period and a contorted interpretation of a newspaper article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An outdated provision in the bill McMurtrie refers to would have transferred $198 million a from the general fund to transportation. McMurtrie assumes all of that money would have been stripped from public schools when, in fact, the general fund also supports public safety and health programs. About one-third of the fund pays for education, so the hit to schools likely would have been around $66 million a year, or $660 million over a decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The updated provision in the bill, ignored by McMurtrie, will shift $113 million from the general fund to transportation. If budgeting practices hold up, that should mean about a $38 million annual hit to education, or $380 million over 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either way, McMurtrie&rsquo;s claim of a $2 billion raid on education doesn&rsquo;t hold up. Nor does his subsequent claim that the bill &quot;potentially&quot; took billions from schools. And the legislature&rsquo;s public debate on the bill, amplified by extensive media coverage, dissolves McMurtrie&rsquo;s claim that lawmakers &quot;quietly&quot; shifted education dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rate McMurtrie&rsquo;s statement False.</p>\r\n", "ruling_comments_date": "2015-05-17T21:14:00.464136", "ruling_date": "2015-05-18T00:00:00", "ruling_headline": "Alex McMurtrie says Va. lawmakers shifted $2 billion from education to roads", "ruling_headline_slug": "alex-mcmurtrie-says-va-lawmakers-shifted-2-billion", "ruling_link_text": "Thoroughly wrong", "ruling_state": null, "source_documents": null, "sources": "<p>Alex for Senate, &quot;<a href=\"http://alexforstatesenate.com/news/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Alex McMurtrie Jr., the education candidate</u></a>,&quot; assessed, May 12, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alex for Virginia, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexForVA?lang=en\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>tweets</u></a>, May 7, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Washington Post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/va-politics/va-lawmakers-approve-landmark-transportation-plan/2013/02/23/712969d8-7de4-11e2-82e8-61a46c2cde3d_story.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>Virginia lawmakers approve sweeping transportation plan</u></a>,&quot; Feb. 23, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legislative Information Services, <a href=\"http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?ses=131&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2313\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>HB2313</u></a>, approved 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Department of Planning and Budget, <a href=\"http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?131+oth+HB2313FCHP122+PDF\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>HB2313 financial impact statement</u></a>, April 3, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interview with Robert Vaughn, staff director of the House Appropriations Committee, May 12, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "speaker": {"adkey": null, "advalue": null, "barely_true_count": 0, "current_job": "lawyer", "false_count": 1, "first_name": "Alex", "half_true_count": 0, "home_state": "Virginia", "id": 3187, "last_name": "McMurtrie Jr.", "mostly_true_count": 0, "name_slug": "alex-mcmurtrie-jr", "pants_count": 0, "party": {"id": 1, "party": "Democrat", "party_slug": "democrat", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/party/1/"}, "photo": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/McMURTRIE.jpg", "primary_edition": {"adkey": "Editions", "advalue": "Virginia", "edition": "Virginia", "edition_slug": "virginia", "has_afterthefact": false, "id": 10, "index_page": false, "meter_name": "The Virginia Truth-O-Meter", "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/edition/10/"}, "promise_meter_cutout": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/person/3187/", "total_count": 1, "true_count": 0, "website": "http://alexforstatesenate.com/"}, "statement": "<p>State legislators &quot;quietly shifted $2 billion from education to road building&quot; in 2013.</p>\r\n", "statement_context": "a campaign flyer.", "statement_date": "2015-05-07", "statement_type": {"id": 2, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/statementtype/2/", "statement_type": "Claim", "type_description": "blog post "}, "subject": [{"description": "", "id": 32, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/32/", "subject": "Education", "subject_slug": "education", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 120, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/120/", "subject": "State Budget", "subject_slug": "state-budget", "used_in_edition": []}, {"description": "", "id": 44, "photo": null, "resource_uri": "/api/v/2/subject/44/", "subject": "Transportation", "subject_slug": "transportation", "used_in_edition": []}], "target": [], "twitter_headline": ""}
