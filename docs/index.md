# Lies have short legs
## Project for CS-401 Applied Data Analysis Course at EPFL


The old quote says _Lies have short legs_ meaning lies that have short legs are
those that carry you a little distance but cannot outrun the truth. However, is
it really true that we cannot get away with a lie and that the truth always
comes out? In this report we want to answer this question by analysing public statements
of voted politicians in the USA.

For this we collected **15 471** statements from
[politifact](https://www.politifact.com/). These were statements ranging from
2011 to 2018, all were ruled on a scale from *pants-on-fire* to *true*. The
statements vary from state-politics to health over security concerns and were
either submitted by the public or selected by the organisation itself for
fact-checking. The second dataset are the public election results for 2012,
2014, and 2016 for the house and the senate of the U.S.

Before we the answer this question we want to show the content of the
statements in the form of answering the 5Ws: Who, What, When, Where and Why.
Since the question *Why were these statements made?* is not really answerable
with our data we omit this question.

## Understanding the statements

Each statement was judged by a journalist based on [primary and public
sources](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i#Our%20sourcing),
and later rechecked by three editors, the assigned label comes on a [scale of six values](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i#Truth-O-Meter%20ratings):

- **TRUE**: The statement is accurate and thereâ€™s nothing significant missing.
- **MOSTLY TRUE**: The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
- **HALF TRUE**: The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
- **MOSTLY FALSE**: The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
- **FALSE**: The statement is not accurate.
- **PANTS ON FIRE**: The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

We scraped the API of Politifact, [example API call](http://www.politifact.com/api/v/2/statement/99/?format=json) in order to collect as many data points as possible.

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/label_counts_overall.png"><img src="images/label_counts_overall.png"></a>

As can be seen, the label `mostly false` does not occur in our dataset. The
labels seem to follow a normal distribution with a centre around `half-true`.

![labels_over_years](/images/labels_over_years.png)

The distribution of labels over the years reflects the general amount of data for these years. **TODO check this with a better plot**

## When were these statements made?


![timeline_plot](/images/timeline_plot.png)
![ratio_false_true_parties](/images/ratio_false_true_parties.png)

We observe that the ratio of false-to-true statements for democrats goes slightly downwards, but for Republicans the ratio is on a steep climb.


**TODO:**

## Who makes these statements?

![nb_statements_10_largest_groups](/images/nb_statements_10_largest_groups.png)

The distribution of statements per group (this can be a party, a general
organisation, a journalist, ...) shows that overall more statements from
republicans were fact-checked. This could indicate a potential bias, but
without knowing the complete number of statements made this is not enough to
say that this source is biased.

![nb_rulings_for_major_parties.png](/images/nb_rulings_for_major_parties.png)
![nb_simple_rulings_for_major_parties.png](/images/nb_simple_rulings_for_major_parties.png)

Given the rulings themselves we can clearly see that Republicans lie more (38%
vs 21%). Both parties have roughly the same amount of true statements (3255 and
3105 for the Republicans and the Democrats respectively).

![biggest_liers_plot](/images/biggest_liers_plot.png)

**TODO:**

## What are the statements about?

![subjects_plot](/images/subjects_plot.png)

**TODO:**
The importance of the different political subjects varies. Most common subject turns out to be economy with nearly **3500** statements. The second one appears to be politics with nearly **2400** statements. Security has **1600** statements. We have **1500** statements related to family, **1300** to health, **900** to immigration, **900** to environment. We can observe that all these subjects are reccurent in politics. Economy seems to be particularly proeminent in these statements. This might possibly reflect politics priorities.

## Where were these statements made?

**TODO:**

## Bringing in election data

The final results for the election in 2018 where not out at the time of
writing, therefore only the results for the elections in 2012 2014, and 2016
where used. In order to compare different behaviour we chose to compare
politicians from the house and congress during this period. There were 5653
different politicians with votes in this period. Since we are interested in the
effect of the statements on the voting results we need at least two periods.
This leaves us with 1110 politicians. The voting cycle for every position is
not the same, we considered all combinations as a valid combination as along as
there was data.

Combining the election results with the statements gives data for 48
politicians. Further requiring that some statements were made in both time
periods (two years prior to an election in the two-year cycle) reduces the
number to 5 politicians. For those five politicians we could build 10 data
points to compare the false-true-ratio to the election results:

![difference_election_results](difference_election_results.png)

Given the low number of matches found we would not advice to draw any
conclusions from these findings.

For these politicians we observed only one period in which an increase in the
false-true-ratio had a negative effect.

![difference_false_true_ratio_to_election_results](difference_false_true_ratio_to_election_results.png)

## On the source and quality of the statements

PolitiFact [started in
2007](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/)
and describes itself as a "not-for-profit" organisation and is [owned by](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/#Our%20ownership) the [Poynter Institute for Media Studies](https://www.poynter.org/), but relies primarily on the financial support from the [Tampa Bay Times](http://www.tampabay.com/).
Donations exceeding $1'000 are [publicly listed](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/blog/2011/oct/06/who-pays-for-politifact/). Around one third of the statements were [suggested by readers](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/). [PolitiFact won the Pulitzer Price for National Reporting in 2009](https://web.archive.org/web/20090919173210/http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2009-National-Reporting).

In order to evaluate a possible bias better we looked at the rulings of each
journalist. In total 368 journalists made judged statements, 43 of those made
up 80% of all rulings.  Looking at how these journalists rule based on the
ratio between false and true statements we observed a significant difference:
60.1% for Republicans and 16.8% for Democrats, meaning that Republicans had a
much higher likelihood to be judged to lie. We again stress the point, that
this is does not necessarily indicate a potential bias, as we lack ground
truth.

![ratio_comparision_author_basis](/images/ratio_comparision_author_basis.png)

The ratio is however very drastic and underlines more the selection bias of
statements, the statements were probably not randomly selected. Instead the
selection is biased towards what the organisation deemed to be newsworthy. The
ratio of lies could therefore lie much lower.

Based on this we deem the source to somewhat reliable but also biased, but not
biased enough to not consider the data as valuable and insightful.

## Number of statements per speaker

<!-- <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/label_counts_overall.png"><img src="images/label_counts_overall.png"></a> -->
**TODO:**
People are not equal when we consider the number of statements recorded and assessed by politifact. Two president appear at the top of the list: Donald Trump with **639** statements and Barac Obama with **619** satements. 3rd place comes to Hillary Clinton, who was First Lady of U.S. and senator. In the top 10 we have people having more than **100** statements. This number decreases drastically for the remaining **300** other people.

## The evolution of lies during time?

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_years_count.png"><img src="images/statement_years_count.png"></a>
**TODO:**
Variations of number of lies is visible across the years. At the beginning of politifact lies are the rarest with 250 lies in 2007. This also corresponds to a lower total number of statements. Moreover, 2 peaks can be observed. The first one occurs in 2012 with 2000 lies and the second one occurs in 2016 with 1800 lies. Both peaks correspond to U.S. presidential elections when politics are at their peak of activity.

## Who are the biggest liars (people/groups/context)
**TODO:**
We consider as big liar a person who is reported to lie often with respect to the politifacts data gathered. The biggest liar is the U.S. president Donald Trump with **92 pants** on fire statements. It corresponds to **14%** of its recorded statements. Michele Barman has a even higher pants on fire percentage of **26%** for **16** pants on fire. She is a member of the Republican Party and is a former member of the United States House of Representatives. Other politicians as Mitt Romney, Rick Perry or Newt Gingrich have between 10 and 15 pants on fire. The former U.S. president Barac Obama has **9** pants on fire, but it represents a proportion of pants on fire **10** times lower than for Donald Trump.

## Do politicians coming from different states lie more?
**TODO:**

## When do they lie?

### Top lying year is ...
Let's find out during which year the number of false statements was the biggest.

First, let's see the total count distribution of statements over the years.

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_month_count.png"><img src="images/statement_month_count.png"></a>

From the plot we can notice that the biggest number of statements from this dataset was collected during 2012. We can also notice a small oscillation in the counts where 2012, 2014, 2016 represent also local minima. This can probably be explained by the fact that the elections were during that years.

Now, let's see the count of statements divided into groups based on label.

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_years_count_with_labels.png"><img src="images/statement_years_count_with_labels.png"></a>

From this plot we can notice that statements labeled with _Pants on Fire_ label had the highest count in 2017. On the other hand, the number of _True_ statements was the highest during 2011. Please note that this is only the count of statements, and it does not mean that plititians lied the most during 2017. Therefore, let's see the proportion:

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_years_count_percentage.png"><img src="images/statement_years_count_percentage.png"></a>

From the plot we can notice that statements collected during the 2000 and 2002 were all negative/false ones. However, the number of collected statements in that period is neglectable, so we wont discuss about it.

From the plot we can see that the biggest proportion of false statements was during 2012, around **58.54**. On the contrary, we can see that during 2007, the proportion percentage of positive/true statements was greater than the percentage of negative/false statements, around **47.79**.

Let's also see it normalized:

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_years_count_percentage_norm.png"><img src="images/statement_years_count_percentage_norm.png"></a>

**Answer: The top Lie year was 2012, and the Top Truth year was 2007!**


### Top lying month is ...
Let's find out during which months the number of false statements is the biggest. False statements include statements that are _false_, _pants-fire_, and _barely_true_.

First, let's see the total count distribution of statements over the months.

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_month_count.png"><img src="images/statement_month_count.png"></a>

From this plot we can see that the biggest number of statements is made during the October probably because the voting usually ends in November.

Now, it will be nice to see the count of statement labels during each month, to see how many statements were positive (_true_, _mostly-true_, _half-true) and negative depending on the month. Labels are noted in the plot's legend.

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_month_count_with_labels.png"><img src="images/statement_month_count_with_labels.png"></a>

From this plot, we can notice that the biggest number of false statements is given during the October as well. In addition, the number of _Pants on Fire_ statements is also the biggest during the October. We should not conclude here that polititians lie the most durning the October. It is true that the number of false statements during the October is the highest, but we should not forget that also the total number of statements is also highest during this month.

Let's see the percentage of negative statements in comparison to the total amount of statements given in that month.

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_month_count_percentage.png"><img src="images/statement_month_count_percentage.png"></a>

And let's see it normalized:

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_month_count_percentage_norm.png"><img src="images/statement_month_count_percentage_norm.png"></a>

In the end we see, that indeed the biggest number of negative statements is given durng the October, around **62.15 %**.

On the other hand, the biggest number of positive/true statements is given during the January, around **50.73 %**.

It is interesting to see that there is no time where truth leads the game. The number of negative/false statements is always at least 50% or above.

**Answer: The top Lie month is October, and the Top Truth month is January!**



### Top lying week-day is ...
Let's see during which week day we should not believe polititian's statements.

The total count of statements is shown in the plot bellow:
<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_weekday_count.png"><img src="images/statement_weekday_count.png"></a>

The biggest number of statements is given during Tuesday. And the least number of statements is given in Saturday.

And the statement counts with labels is:
<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_weekday_count_with_labels.png"><img src="images/statement_weekday_count_with_labels.png"></a>

We can see that the highest number of statement count with label _Pants on Fire_ is on Wednesday. On the other hand, the biggest number of _True_ statements is on Tuesday.

But, let's not conclude anything before seeing the percentage:
<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_weekday_count_percentage.png"><img src="images/statement_weekday_count_percentage.png"></a>

and normalized plot:
<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_weekday_count_percentage_norm.png"><img src="images/statement_weekday_count_percentage_norm.png"></a>

These two plots show summed negative statements (_false_, _pants-fire_, _barely_true) and we can see that the biggest number of false statements is on Tuesday, however the proportionally bigger number of false statements is given on Wednesday, around **58.18 %**. In addition, we can see that during Saturday there is the least number of false statements, but also the proportion of false statements is smallest, around **54.42 %**.

**Answer: The top Lie week-day is Wednesday, and the Top Truth week-day is Saturday!**
