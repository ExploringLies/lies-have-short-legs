# Lies have short legs
## Project for CS-401 Applied Data Analysis Course at EPFL


The old quote says _Lies have short legs_ meaning lies that have short legs are
those that carry you a little distance but cannot outrun the truth. However, is
it really true that we cannot get away with a lie and that the truth always
comes out? In this report we want to answer this question by analysing public statements
of voted politicians in the USA.

For this we collected **15 471** statements from
[politifact](https://www.politifact.com/). These were statements ranging from
2011 to 2018, all were ruled on a scale from *pants-on-fire* to *true*. The
statements vary from state-politics to health over security concerns and were
either submitted by the public or selected by the organisation itself for
fact-checking. The second dataset are the public election results for 2012,
2014, and 2016 for the house and the senate of the U.S.

Before we the answer this question we want to show the content of the
statements in the form of answering the 5Ws: Who, What, When, Where and Why.
Since the question *Why were these statements made?* is not really answerable
with our data we omit this question.

## Understanding the statements

Each statement was judged by a journalist based on [primary and public
sources](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i#Our%20sourcing),
and later rechecked by three editors, the assigned label comes on a [scale of six values](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i#Truth-O-Meter%20ratings):

- **TRUE**: The statement is accurate and thereâ€™s nothing significant missing.
- **MOSTLY TRUE**: The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
- **HALF TRUE**: The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
- **MOSTLY FALSE**: The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
- **FALSE**: The statement is not accurate.
- **PANTS ON FIRE**: The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

We scraped the API of Politifact, [example API call](http://www.politifact.com/api/v/2/statement/99/?format=json) in order to collect as many data points as possible.

As can be seen the label `mostly false` does not occur in our dataset. The
labels seem to follow a normal distribution with a centre around `half-true`.

![labels_over_years](/images/labels_over_years.png)

The distribution of labels over the years is reflects the general amount of data for these years. **TODO check this with a better plot**

## When were these statements made?


![timeline_plot](/images/timeline_plot.png)
![ratio_false_true_parties](ratio_false_true_parties.png)

We observe that the ratio of false-to-true statements for democrats goes slightly downwards, but for Republicans the ratio is on a steep climb.


**TODO:**

## Who makes these statements?

![nb_statements_10_largest_groups](nb_statements_10_largest_groups.png)

The distribution of statements per group (this can be a party, a general
organisation, a journalist, ...) shows that overall more statements from
republicans were fact-checked. This could indicate a potential bias, but
without knowing the complete number of statements made this is not enough to
say that this source is biased.

![nb_rulings_for_major_parties.png](nb_rulings_for_major_parties.png)
![nb_simple_rulings_for_major_parties.png](nb_simple_rulings_for_major_parties.png)

Given the rulings themselves we can clearly see that Republicans lie more (38%
vs 21%). Both parties have roughly the same amount of true statements (3255 and
3105 for the Republicans and the Democrats respectively).

## On the source and quality of the statements

PolitiFact [started in
2007](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/)
and describes itself as a "not-for-profit" organisation and is [owned by](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/#Our%20ownership) the [Poynter Institute for Media Studies](https://www.poynter.org/), but relies primarily on the financial support from the [Tampa Bay Times](http://www.tampabay.com/).
Donations exceeding $1'000 are [publicly listed](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/blog/2011/oct/06/who-pays-for-politifact/). Around one third of the statements were [suggested by readers](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/feb/12/principles-truth-o-meter-politifacts-methodology-i/).

### Top lying year is ...
Let's find out during which year the number of false statements was the biggest.

First, let's see the total count distribution of statements over the years.

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_month_count.png"><img src="images/statement_month_count.png"></a>

From the plot we can notice that the biggest number of statements from this dataset was collected during 2012. We can also notice a small oscillation in the counts where 2012, 2014, 2016 represent also local minima. This can probably be explained by the fact that the elections were during that years.

Now, let's see the count of statements divided into groups based on label.

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_years_count_with_labels.png"><img src="images/statement_years_count_with_labels.png"></a>

From this plot we can notice that statements labeled with _Pants on Fire_ label had the highest count in 2017. On the other hand, the number of _True_ statements was the highest during 2011. Please note that this is only the count of statements, and it does not mean that plititians lied the most during 2017. Therefore, let's see the proportion:

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_years_count_percentage.png"><img src="images/statement_years_count_percentage.png"></a>

From the plot we can notice that statements collected during the 2000 and 2002 were all negative/false ones. However, the number of collected statements in that period is neglectable, so we wont discuss about it. 

From the plot we can see that the biggest proportion of false statements was during 2012, around **58.54**. On the contrary, we can see that during 2007, the proportion percentage of positive/true statements was greater than the percentage of negative/false statements, around **47.79**.

Let's also see it normalized:

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_years_count_percentage_norm.png"><img src="images/statement_years_count_percentage_norm.png"></a>

### Top lying month is ...
Let's find out during which months the number of false statements is the biggest. False statements include statements that are _false_, _pants-fire_, and _barely_true_.

First, let's see the total count distribution of statements over the months.

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_month_count.png"><img src="images/statement_month_count.png"></a>

From this plot we can see that the biggest number of statements is made during the October probably because the voting usually ends in November.

Now, it will be nice to see the count of statement labels during each month, to see how many statements were positive (_true_, _mostly-true_, _half-true) and negative depending on the month. Labels are noted in the plot's legend.

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_month_count_with_labels.png"><img src="images/statement_month_count_with_labels.png"></a>

From this plot, we can notice that the biggest number of false statements is given during the October as well. In addition, the number of _Pants on Fire_ statements is also the biggest during the October. We should not conclude here that polititians lie the most durning the October. It is true that the number of false statements during the October is the highest, but we should not forget that also the total number of statements is also highest during this month.

Let's see the percentage of negative statements in comparison to the total amount of statements given in that month.

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_month_count_percentage.png"><img src="images/statement_month_count_percentage.png"></a>

And let's see it normalized:

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="images/statement_month_count_percentage_norm.png"><img src="images/statement_month_count_percentage_norm.png"></a>

In the end we see, that indeed the biggest number of negative statements is given durng the October, around **62.15 %**.

On the other hand, the biggest number of positive/true statements is given during the January, around **50.73 %**.

It is interesting to see that there is no time where truth leads the game. The number of negative/false statements is always at least 50% or above.

#### Answer: The top Lie month is October, and the Top Truth month is January!
